    "reviews": "This Starbucks is on the second floor of the BU School of Management, but you don't need to be affiliated with BU to use it. It's a great place to study--the seating area is massive, because it shares seating with a little sandwich place in the same space. It's a little louder than other Starbucks I've been to because of the volume of people, but the almost guaranteed seating and variety of seating (big tables, small tables, high tables, booths, and counters along the walls and windows) make this a great spot to get work done on your own or in a group. The worst coffee. Every time. Alas no other options. They gave me a grande when I ordered a venti This Starbucks closes  too early for ambitious students of Questrom. The opening hours should last longer in order to grab a coffee or a snack while studying. Closed at 11:30am on 2/23/20 despite website saying it was open till 7pm on that day I pop in to buy some scratch tickets from time to time. No complaints. Owner even cashed me out of a $500 winning ticket just before he closed one time. I appreciate that since some store owners HATE cashing out big winners sometimes. Cool little store across from Forest Hills Station lower busway if you need to buy something while waiting for your bus to leave. Very convenient, I\u2019m honestly impressed with the variety of things they carry. Staff are pretty polite. Outstanding neighborhood store and very nice people working most of the time. The owner is very good to community I've been here 40yrs,and she is also very beautiful lady. I've been more than grateful to them the way they treated us in the neighborhood Hello, I would just like to report that I went to the store to purchase some lottery tickets and I kindly asked them to let me know which $10 ticket has the least amount like I normally been going to the store for the last six years are rude cashier Told me no I\u2019m not doing that. That\u2019s too much. I have customers and it was no one in line behind me. Unacceptable. Poor customer service. Just done over bigger more space..more goods. Great people..neighborhood strong. Safe. And ALOT of scratch lotto winners..ALOT"

    "reviews": "The new owners do not care about the neighborhood and it is evident in the 10 months or so they have operated the store. Take a look around the outside of the store anytime and you will find trash and empty nips. The business  really looks like a head shoppe selling booze. Service is poor as are the attitudes. Wish there was a no star rating. The new owners of this business are really sketchy. Employees are constantly double scanning items and not issuing receipts to customers. Pretty much the whole neighborhood stopped going here after the business changed hands and now I can see why. No more deli counter or sandwiches. Basically just a liquor store catering to selling to the college crowd here. Bunch of cheap wine/liquors and Junk food.\nGoogle should reset the reviews of this place because nothing more than a year old is pertinent anymore. Last time going here, sticking with quality from now on. Very convenient neighborhood market with all the essentials and more. Good beer selection and deli sandwiches. The staff is always friendly and helpful. 5 stars despite high prices Nice spot for a neighborhood feel convenience store. Everything you want including friendly help. Great place, friendly staff and extensive selection of beer, wine and alcohol. I went to the branch and met a Ms Huda for transfer money she was a wonderful person and helped me alot. Thanks for her and the bank too This is one of the slowest BofA branches in the chain, and that\u2019s saying something. When their abysmal phone and online support fails you, no worries, their incompetent staff stands ready to make things even more difficult. That is, when they\u2019re not hiding downstairs or \u201cin meetings.\u201d Wasted over an hour trying to add my son to my online banking profile and get a single page notarized (which their one notary never got to - too busy smoking, I\u2019d guess). Time to switch all of our accounts to Cap One or basically anywhere else (other than Chase, which also sucks, or Wells Fargo, which is crooked). The only time they paid attention to me was to chastise me for taking a picture of their lobby. Said I could be trying to steal private customer information. Finally got in to see banker, and after 30 minutes, Gabriel was unable to add the account due to a technical glitch. I\u2019d give negative stars, if that was an option. I decided to give Bank of America a second chance after the disaster I had yesterday with the Bank of America branch at 1237 Commonwealth Ave. Everyone was friendly beginning with the security guard. I asked about opening a checking account and someone was available right away. She explained everything in perfect detail and I now am a customer at Bank of America! I wish I had visited this location first. After making me wait for 1.5 hours they told me they can\u2019t open an account. It\u2019s such a waste of time! Why they didn\u2019t tell me in the first place? Bad customer service. Came in as a walk in. Quick and efficient service. Angel was patient and helpful. Manager was also great. Highly recommend this branch if you need something done on the go. Small variety of Caribbean music but I still found a few gems. I regret not purchasing the Sugar Aloes & Baron. Fun store overall, worth the trip if you're a music lover. Love me some Nugs! CDs, cassettes, and vinyls galore. It\u2019s a non-descript building & yes it\u2019s dusty and slightly disorganized but honestly if you want a pristine store where you don\u2019t have to rummage to find some treasures then just take your poser self to Urban Outfitters on Newbury. Wide selection of genres and a range of prices, from a few bucks to rare collectibles. I am glad to have discovered this place and will be back! Prices could be a little lower. $30 dollars seems a little high for some of the records, but selection is nice, and if you don't mind looking around for a bit, you can find some great deals. Big collection of records. Mostly rock, a good collection and neatly organised. Not worth the trip. I am an avid vinyl collector in the Boston area, Nuggets is the closest record store to my house and I avoid it. The selection has not changed at ALL in the 2 years i have lived in the area, and the prices are insane for what they have. Places like Looney Tunes, Cheapo or Village Vinyl are always a better stop. Better selection, better quality, better prices. Better ingredients, Better pizza, papa john\u2019s. This 7/11 location in fenway near the kenmore station is one of the worst. The owner is very rude and unprofessional. I had 2 separate bad incidents involving the owner. the first one he tried to call the police on me and was proven to be in the wrong, and today I went to purchase cranberry juice and he told me that my EBT doesn't cover juice. The owner decides what he allows to be charged for EBT which isn't fair. I paid for the juice with my debit card, but the fact that EBT gets you juice anywhere but this 7/11 location is reasons to not even waste time going there. I personally know the owner and work for a company that 711 subcontracts and I can tell you that he wouldn't have done that normally and so I ask what did u do to make him react that way and respond that way cause u cut off the rest of the video..711s prices are high but that's a charge for convenience shopping if u don't like it don't go there.. Is it POSSIBLE to give ZERO STARS? I always use the mobile check out feature of the 7-Eleven app whenever I visit 7-Eleven. I used it here, and couldn\u2019t find the kiosk to verify my purchase. I thought maybe I missed it, so went to the counter and was told they didn\u2019t have mobile checkout. I have been to a location which did not, and the app did not present the option to use mobile check out. This was clearly not the case, as the transaction was processed, a receipt was sent to me, and the money was withdrawn from my bank. I thought perhaps there\u2019s was broken or they didn\u2019t like it so they wanted to personally see the receipts, so I showed mine and started to leave. The cashier pointed to one item and asked \u201cdid you pay for that?\u201d I said yes I showed you the the receipt here it is again and it says two items and I set them on the counter and pointed at them one at a time. she called another employee over, who said that they didn\u2019t have that, and that I need to pay him. I said 7-Eleven has taken my money so these things belong to me. I offered two options, thinking all he needed to do was contact his headquarters and figure out what\u2019s going on they would probably reimburse him or take whatever steps were necessary. Option one was I would be glad to show him the receipt again and leave with the items that I had paid for. Option two - He could  refund my purchase price and I would be happy to return the items. His response was to snatch the items one off the counter right in front of me and one out of my hand. I said wait those are my items I paid for them and I showed you the receipt they are mine you\u2019re stealing from me and I should call the police. He said go ahead and call. At that point I stormed out of the store, embarrassed because I\u2019ve never been accused of stealing anything, and decided to write this review to warn others off from this thief! The associate didn\u2019t know how to use the register and started verbally assaulting me. I left what I was going to buy on the counter and left. Horrible experience. No need to be so aggressive.\n\n7Eleven owner:\n\"That doesn't sound right...\"\n\nDayana (1 year ago/ 1 star)\n\u201cThere is a guy that works there older guy. I think he\u2019s from Somalia. He\u2019s so rude. He doesn\u2019t want to work.\u201d\n\nMagnificent T (2 years ago/ 1 star)\n\u201cThe black guy in the store is very rude and racist\u2026\u201d\n\nHey NeTTie (4 years ago/ 1 star)\n\u201cI was harassed\u2026\u201d\n\nFranklin (11 Months ago/ 1 star)\n\u201c\u2026the employee is being disrespectful as I only asked what time he is opening the store\u2026\u201d\n\nSince I can't respond, I'll just edit my review slightly. What part of what I said \"doesn't sound right\"?... I have sent a complaint to corporate and, honestly, after your dismissive response, I think I'll send another. This should have zero reviews, the truth is that I was shocked by the attitude of a black man who works there, I asked for a roll and a Hot dog and he gave me two Hot Dogs and I explained that I only asked him for one, he got upset he spoke badly to me and broke the food with his hands in my presence telling me that he would not sell me.... I don\u2019t know how there are people working in food places with those attitudes \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c I don\u2019t like to give bad grades but he\u2019s not ready to be there... Love them! Ordered cupcakes on two separate occasions and each time have absolutely loved them. My fave bakery for sure! They make great gifts. I have ordered cakes from them multiple times, and every time they went above and beyond. The cakes were tasty and customer service was great as well. Fantastic cupcakes! Not only did they look amazing, they tasted great. I called week of for some bachelorette cupcakes. The shop was so accommodating. Highly recommend. I\u2019m not sure that \u201cincredible\u201d would be a big enough word to describe our experience here. We brought our 10 month old baby and were immediately welcomed with open arms. Our waiter was very sweet and offered us great recommendations. I enjoyed an amazing Manhattan and my husband enjoyed a Kentucky Mule. We got the chips loaded, the cottage pie pasty, the chicken pot pie pasty (it replaced the thanksgiving pasty) and the sticky toffee pudding. From start to finish the meal was incredible. The cherry on top was the owner who came and talked to us and said hi to the baby. He was so unbelievably kind and warm. We felt at home. I would go out of my way to travel back to Boston just to revisit this gem. I can\u2019t say enough about the Cornish Pasty Co! Really loved this place! The pasty were amazing. We got the chicken tikka, bangers and mash, and pepper steak. My favorite was the peppered steak, but the other two were really good. I also got a salted caramel white Russian which was superb. Sweet and creamy, but you could still taste the alcohol. Would recommend! Great service here!\nLoved the Oggie - it was delicious and baked well!\nBroccoli & Cauliflower Mornay was a bit disappointing and under seasoned.\nBanoffee pie was a generous portion. The crust was thick and it was gone quickly. Amazing food, drinks, and service! Wes produced the most amazing espresso martini I've ever had, followed by a super refreshing and well-balanced Lion's Tail. The Bangers and Mash pasty was delicious; slightly pricey, sure, but the taste was superb and prepared perfectly by the kitchen. The service was excellent; Wes is super personable and takes his time to help find what you want, and is just a warm and welcoming person. Will be back the next time I'm on this side of Boston! First time eating here and really glad we discovered it. Hella good food and beer. We had the peppered steak pasty, curried potatoes, Founders Porter, and Springdale Mocha Stout. Oh and our waitress Nislean was amazing as well. Highly recommended and definitely would come back again. \ud83e\udd13\ud83c\udf7b I had an amazing appointment with Fatima. I didn\u2019t have to wait at all and her service was amazing. She was incredibly helpful and answered all my questions. I heavily recommend coming to this branch. Well located branch and excellent customer service! ... I receive very good attention from manager Sneh and Banker Francis every time I visit them. The best staff always efficient they have the best hours of any other bank in the city of Boston. The manager Gabriel is absolutely awesome. Boston orthodontics has been serviced by sun tender as long as it has been open in Boston and we have always been more than happy. I went there a couple of Saturdays ago. I've been having an ongoing issue with Santander that went unresolved for several months.... I met with Gabriel, he was able to call customer service with me. The issue was resolved that day. When I go in, his Customer Service is always good. The branch appears well-maintained and has parking which is always a plus. I\u2019m an international student and they guided me through the whole process, explaining everything to me. The staff is very friendly, especially John. This one time I forgot to take an appointment before, but they were really sweet and attended to my request. Of all the ticket agencies I have dealt with buying and selling over the years, Ace is by far the least friendly for the buyer.  Most recently, they advised me that their \"user agreement\" allows their sellers to get away with misrepresenting what seat/row the ticket is in, as long as it is \"comparable\" (or is it Ace doing the misreprenting?)... Not cool.  Buyer beware.\n\nFor example, those familiar with TD Garden know that row 15 is the top row on the balcony, allowing fans to stand for the entire game if they so choose.  The ticket I just bought was advertised as row 15, and after purchasing I received a ticket for row 14.  \"Sorry, no refunds or exchanges\".\n\nOnly in hindsight does it make sense why Ace usually has the lowest prices in town. April is the absolute worst. The front desk staff are very nice and accommodating, but it is April Martin, the senior account executive here that makes them deserve this negative review.\n\nApril is really bad at managing accounts as an account executive (I thought this was what she was hired to do!). The front desk staff are fine and friendly, but I think this lady April could use some much needed customer service training and just being able to interact with other people well in general.\n\nEvery time I interact with her, I feel like I want to rip the hair out of my follicles... I don't think thats how anyone should feel when interacting with a business representative.. I would give them zero stars if I could.\n\nAbsolutely awful customer service. Downloaded tickets to MLB app months ago for Pink in July. Had to get a new phone and now the tickets won't appear on app and ace ticket is basically telling us to wait till July to see if the tickets will appear. Not great customer service when you say you guarantee 100% satisfaction. Husband spent over 1500 for 2 tickets and we basically have no way to go. Horrible service. Bought gameday tickets for Fenway from here. The agent took time to go over different options in our price range and we ended up with great seats between home plate and first base that were completely free of any obstructions. Do not buy tickets from them\n.. struggling the two years and with credit I still cannot afford to buy tickets I already bought!!! COVID cancelled game refunds or credit was given the credit won't cover 2 tickets now and the 4 I originally bought are now way too expensive. .. ok it's now 2024 I've found pre season, it's what I can afford, and now they won't send me real tickets. It's digital only and have to open an account now with Ticketmaster.   So they can sell my data or leak it to whomever. Ruben did such an amazing job. First time to a barber shop in close to 14 years, and the anxiety I had was immediately gone. I've never felt so good in my own skin after seeing the finished product. I would highly recommend going here if you haven't already. Art is also amazing; though he didn't do my beard, saw his work on the gentleman to my left and know that this barber shop has got to be the best in Boston. I went to Art for my haircut - would enthusiastically recommend him to anyone I know. He is very attentive and focused on detail.  Most importantly, he can deliver exactly what you ask for and do it very WELL with amicable & great overall vibes. In terms of location, it's aesthetically pleasing and very nice. Lastly, if you want a thoughtful barber with expertise, make sure to book an appointment with Art. I went to this barbershop today, and it was a great experience.\nI liked that I could book an appointment online. The place had a nice, authentic vibe.\nRuben, a great barber and an awesome personality, gave me a cool haircut, and we also had an interesting conversation about everything. \ud83d\ude42 Gave me a fresh, clean, perfect haircut. Ruben was mad chill and cut my hair perfectly with ease. Made my first barbershop visit seamless and easy and gave exactly what I wanted without many questions. Highly recommended! I\u2019ve been to Temple of Groom a couple of times and during each visit I\u2019ve had a great experience and received a great cut. During my most recent visit, I got my haircut by Elian, a student barber. He did a wonderful job and gave me one of my best haircuts yet! I highly recommend him, as well as the other barbers. Have come here a few times and never had anything less than amazing service! Lucy was fantastic but any therapist you get will be amazing. Front desk staff always friendly, helpful, and welcoming. I have recommended this place to many friends and will continue to come back! I was in town visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a spa day, and I cannot recommend Sway Spa highly enough!!! The best way to pamper yourself!\n\nLucy did a phenomenal job on my massage and Kate's facial service left me looking and feeling glowing and wonderful. The front desk staff and salon space in general were so calming and welcoming, and I hope to come back next time I'm in Boston! I have been coming to sway spa for over a year now and I love it here. Yara does all my services and she is amazing! She reads my brows better than I can and ensures that I trust the process. The spa space itself is beautiful and peaceful. 10/10 recommend! Had my first deep tissue massage and felt so relaxed after. Lucy and Sarah were very attentive and made sure to ask where we wanted the most attention. Would definitely recommend the 90 minute session. If you want to give yourself a present and treat yourself you need to go to Sway Spa! you will relax and come out rejuvenate! The spa is clean. Sarah and Lucy are exceptional. Great hands, professional and friendly! A mixed bag, but still worth a visit\n\nI recently visited Hunts Photo in Boston to find a new camera. I was immediately impressed by the helpful staff who took the time to understand my needs and even suggested I wait a week to take advantage of their tax-free \"roadshow\" event. This level of customer service was truly unexpected and appreciated.\n\nI ended up purchasing a Sony a6700 and two used lenses (Samyang and Rokinon). The prices were significantly lower than any other store I'd researched, including big box retailers. This alone made the trip worthwhile.\n\nHowever, my second experience at the store was less positive. The staff seemed rushed and less attentive. I specifically asked if the lenses were up-to-date, and was assured they were. Unfortunately, upon returning home from my vacation (the reason I bought the camera!), I discovered that firmware updates were available for both lenses.  I ended up having to buy a lens mount online specifically for updating them. This was quite disappointing, especially since I had explicitly asked about updates at the store.\n\nOverall, I have mixed feelings about Hunts Photo. The initial experience was excellent, with knowledgeable staff and unbeatable prices. However, the lack of attention to detail and inaccurate information during my second visit left me feeling let down. Despite this, I would still recommend Hunts Photo, but with a caveat to double-check any information and not expect the same level of service on every visit. My wife and I went on a trip to Boston from Indiana. First time away from the kids, ever (they were 4&6 at the time.) I brought two rolls of Kentmere Pan 400, B&W 120 film. I bought an old Kodak Junior Six-20 for $7 at a thrift store and repaired it. Long story short, I brought this camera on our trip and thought I thought of everything\u2026I forgot a changing bag and I had to unspool the film from a modified take up spool back onto the original spool, so I could shoot the second. It was a long shot but this place was close to our hotel. I explained the situation and they without hesitation brought me a changing bag and literally saved my trip. Forever grateful to the kind employees who help me out. Had a great experience here. First time printing photos in Boston and had reached out to a few photography-related businesses. Some of them were unable to do it with a quick turnaround so they highly recommended Hunts.\n\nAm very glad I came down. They have a good selection of paper and were very reasonable priced compared to the other businesses I contacted that quoted a far longer turnaround time. I had 5 images printed and it took slightly under 30 mins.\n\nPrices start from $0.59 for a standard 4x6 print. I went for the fine art print with luster effect and the prints came out really well nice. I used to own professional photography printers like the Canon PRO-1 with 12 ink tanks, so I was very pleased to hear that Hunts print photos using a Canon PRO 10 printer.\n\nJesse and his team were friendly and awesome to deal with. Will definitely be back and would encourage anyone who needs quality photography prints to get theirs done at Hunts. First time buying in this store. The experience started via online Chat, then I made a reservation to pickup the products at Boston Store,  since I was going to stay for just a few days in the city. My experience with them was excellent. The staff were very helpful and professional. I do recommend them. I popped into Hunt's to test out a film camera that I recently bought from a vintage shop. Coincidentally, I did not realize that it may be functional until I brought it home and took a better look at it. Jesse was very knowledgeable about the camera itself and gave me so much information on how to use it properly to take some some great photos. He also made important recommendations for the type of film that would be best for a novice film photographer like myself. He was able to help me test out the camera, change the battery and get a lens cap with the leash. Everything was reasonably priced and all in all, was an incredibly enjoyable experience. Jesse spent a good amount of time with me and answered all of my questions. Photography has become my hobby and I am beyond excited to explore it with film! I just wanted to say a big thank you to Jessie today, I truly appreciate him. I definitely found my place for my photo and camera needs. I highly recommend this shop! I recently visited the emergency room at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and I must say, the care and kindness I received truly touched my heart. Dr. Chris W. and Dr. Brittany G. went above and beyond to ensure I felt not only well-cared for but also genuinely valued as a patient. Their professionalism, warmth, and attentiveness immediately put me at ease during what could have been an overwhelming experience. From the way they patiently explained every step of my care to the compassionate manner in which they addressed my concerns, it was evident that they were fully dedicated to my well-being.\n\nEqually remarkable was the nurse Tara S. who attended to me. They took the time to thoroughly read and understand my care plan, ensuring that every detail of my treatment was handled with precision and empathy. Their gentle demeanor and attentive approach made me feel seen and understood, which is something I will always appreciate. It\u2019s not every day that you encounter medical professionals who genuinely care about the comfort and peace of mind of their patients, but this team truly stood out.\n\nI cannot express enough gratitude for how welcomed and cared for I felt during my visit to Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. In a setting where stress and worry often prevail, this team created an environment of trust, reassurance, and genuine kindness. It\u2019s rare to find such a combination of skill and humanity, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have been in their capable hands. Thank you, Dr. Chris W., Dr. Brittany G., and the amazing nurse Tara S., for your outstanding dedication to patient care\u2014you made a world of difference for me. One of the worst hospital in the area.  My husband was hospitalized coupe years ago.  That was one of the worst experience we had in our life. He has a stroke due to te booster vaccine within 36 hours of shot), he was rushed to NWH.  Before he gained the language and conciseness, the nurse or aids on the floor will not order food for him. Two days in a row till I was let in for visiting in afternoon. Also patients pull bells to call for help, but nurses will not answer the bell.  Each nurse holding a computer on the hallway outside patients room but they just ignore the bell call and waiting fir aids to answer the call. When I found my husband missed lunch till afternoon I am let in, I wanted to meet with head of the nurse, but the entire team hiding the name of the person in charge. I finally have to contact patient relationship. But that is a joke again. Stay away from this place if you can.\n2nd year, when my 93 year old mother needs emergency help, I did not call ambience otherwise they will send her to BWH again as in due to the relative distance to the hospital. I drove my mom to Mass General.  It was a totally different experience. I am grade I did extra step to go to a hospital not NWH. I believe the issue with this hospital really lies on the leadership. I went to this emergency room after a painful rash on the left side of my face that was previously diagnosed as cellulitis became worse and painful. I was placed on a stretcher in a hallway for about 13 hours which people repeatedly rammed into. They eventually diagnosed me with dermatitis and rosacea. I used the prescriptions they prescribed and my entire face became red and hot and felt like it was on fire. I didn\u2019t have a problem with the right side of my face previously until I followed their directions. I called the hospital and was told to come back. I asked for the name of the doctor who gave these prescriptions and they refused to tell me so there\u2019s a very good chance I\u2019ll see the same one who obviously gets off on hurting people. I was passed around from doctor to doctor so I don\u2019t know who prescribed these medications. The first picture is what I came into the hospital with. The last two is after following their exact directions. I later figured out what caused this reaction. The medication they gave me aggravates dermatitis. They diagnosed me with dermatitis and gave me a medication which worsens dermatitis. Please make it make sense.\n\nOne more thing: make sure you have a family member or friend with you for the majority of your stay. If not, you will need to walk around and strongly advocate for yourself or you will not be fed for well over 24 hours. The nurse line constantly hung up on me. Also, make sure you know how to turn off the IV machine when it\u2019s finished unless you like getting migraines from the obnoxiously loud beeping. Nobody will bother to go into your room to turn it off. I went here a few months ago and it was honestly a really great experience (as great as having to go to the ER can be) everyone was so kind, there was a nurse that really made me feel more at ease being there. They/He was so supportive, literally sat with me, reassured me, and went out of their way to make me a little ball out of tape that I could use to help stretch out the part of my neck that was strained. I wish I had gotten their name so I could send them a proper thank you card. I hate going into medical settings, but 10/10 I would highly recommend this place to all of my loved ones. Their staff moves slow, the doctors take forever and it\u2019s always a excuse. Not gonna mention a nurses name either, but when she\u2019s referring other E.R to go to because they\u2019ll take better care is a serious problem.\n\nThere\u2019s always a wait even when it\u2019s not busy. When it comes to diagnosing they like to test me for everything twice or three times before they can give me medication that I don\u2019t need, there\u2019s a good chance I ll end up coming back for the same problem and now I have to take other medicines, there\u2019s a money motive behind this hospital and you don\u2019t even have to be a conspiracist to believe it. The only person that\u2019s nice to me is the person checking for insurance.\n\nNot to discriminate either, but those white doctors always do this every time. I don\u2019t care about your lifestyle, ego, and the little micro aggressions. Shame on the P.O.C that work here and think they\u2019re one of them. Quality Mart is an absolute staple in the Back Bay. I am so grateful to have it in our neighborhood. The staff is incredibly kind and always puts the community first. During the pandemic, they went above and beyond to ensure everyone\u2019s safety. Aymen, the owner, is a true neighborhood hero\u2014every year, he hosts a free barbecue on the Fourth of July and during the Boston Marathon, bringing people together in the best way.\n\nBeyond their warm hospitality, Quality Mart offers an impressive liquor selection and a variety of unique snacks tailored to their clientele. They also serve as an Amazon pickup location, providing a safe and convenient option for those who prefer not to leave packages outside. This place isn\u2019t just a store\u2014it\u2019s a cornerstone of the community, where everyone is treated like family. The team and products at Quality Mart are exceptional. It\u2019s part of our neighborhood family! Great quality wine selection and they carry almost everything you would need to fill your grocery shopping and snacking gaps. We go for great quality ice cream, cheese, milk, egg and bacon selections. Anything you need from beverages, to food, to snacks, to office supplies! Literally the greatest store in Boston and I'm not just saying that. Their is an adorable cat named Leo that runs around the store and is super friendly. The manager is also beyond polite and extremely helpful. If they don't have what you're looking for he'll do everything he can to get it for you. The store itself has an outstanding variety of Alcohol and convenience store products. I can't recommend this store enough. Also, they have free dog treats right by the door so feel free to bring your 4 legged friend with you!! Super convenient corner and liquor store\u2026 and they have a cat! Makes my day whenever I see the kitty cat :-) and the employees here are nice as well. I also appreciate that they are a USPS drop-off spot and they hosted a grilling event for 4th of July. The people here are so nice and useful they help u out and give u good advice on items to get and they even gave me a break if I was short on change or whatever good people they would give you their shirts off there back this is Top Five stores in Boston I was genuinely excited because they claim that every single menu is made to an order. I called in, made an order then hung up. After 5 min, I called again to check if I could change the sauce selection. Interestingly,  they said no because the chicken is already mixed in with the sauce. They already finished cooking chicken in 5 min? Then that is another issue. Anyway, I still picked it up expecting the food temperature to be hot at least. THE CHICKEN WAS LUKEWARM. The fries were piping hot, which only added confidence to the theory that the chicken was premade. By the way, it took only 13 min from the very initial call to the pickup time. It was not hot, it was not juicy, and it was so tough. It was just not good. I am so so so disappointed. Pure disappointment. Food was prepared quickly and carefully packaged in sturdy and reliable packaging. We ordered from our hotel across the street, walked over to get it, and the food was very hot when we got back to our hotel to enjoy it!! The restaurant atmosphere was welcoming, warm, clean. The staff warmly greeted us and they were very helpful to make sure we knew where to find the extras. Next time in town, we will choose this location again!! Excellent value, flavor gets the chef\u2019s kiss!! If u want to eat fried chicken, i would recommend to go to this place.\nReally love the spices, and the place is also clean. Plenty tables so u will have a spot to dine in.\nI recommend u to eat with ur friends since the portion is so big. BBQ CHICKEN KENMORE NEVER DISAPPOINTS. We always get bone in chicken wings and they always come out near perfect (for context I\u2019ve been to this location at least once a month this year :\u2019)). I have never gotten a dry wing from this place. The food is always made to order, chicken is always perfectly juicy and tender, and the flavors are chef's kiss. Their non chicken dishes are also super delicious -- you can't go wrong with your order! They also have gloves, plates, and napkins ready, which makes sharing super clean and convenient.\n\nI highly recommend coming to this location if you're looking for Korean fried chicken. The Kenmore location is definitely better than the Allston and Chinatown locations. Nice restaurant, not fancy but also not rough (except for the exterior stairs, which are beat up). Great location by Kenmore Square.\n\nPretty good variety of options (although mostly greasy, spicy, not the healthiest food). Limited vegetarian options. Tasty food, in fairly generous portions.\n\nPleasant interiors, comfortable seating, clean restrooms. Upbeat background music, not too loud, so people can have conversations.\n\nNot 5 stars because it's not accessible, the food is served in disposable dishes, they do not serve water, and the prices are on the higher side ($16 for that bowl of rice and beef).\n\nPretty good overall \ud83d\udc4d How expensive this place is depends on what you order. The rice bowls (donburi) are quite filling and come with large, thick cuts of tasty raw seafood. But if you want to splurge and go gourmet, this place certainly offers you that option, too. The ambience was pleasant and the service was very attentive, yet not intrusive. Really disappointed with this place. The rice bowl ingredients were clearly not fresh and even had a bitter taste. The steamed egg was completely bland, with no seasoning at all. Despite being labeled as a Japanese restaurant, it\u2019s actually run by Chinese owners, and the flavors do not reflect authentic Japanese cuisine. Would not recommend. The food is very fresh and tasty. Food is slightly expensive for the portion size, and the music is incredibly loud. However the service is amazing and the place is very clean. Incredibly fresh fish! Top tier quality. Closest i\u2019ve found since japan. Fairly priced, good drinks, and truly impressive melt-in mouth tuna and salmon. Nagomi Izakaya is an absolute gem that exceeded all expectations! From the moment we sat down, the experience was nothing short of spectacular. We indulged in a range of dishes, including the wagyu beef scallop, roasted wagyu beef maki, chirashi don, and the torched toro and uni hand rolls, and each dish was an extraordinary delight. The attention to detail was impeccable, with flavors and presentation executed to perfection.\n\nThe staff was not only attentive but also exceptionally knowledgeable and eager to help, enhancing our overall dining experience. Every bite was a testament to the chef's skill and dedication. To top it all off, the pricing was surprisingly reasonable for the quality of food and service provided. If you're seeking an unforgettable dining experience with top-tier cuisine and warm, inviting service, Nagomi Izakaya is the place to be. Highly recommended! We dined at Blue Ribbon Brasserie last night, Saturday, with a party of 6. All of us chose to order from the Dine Out Boston menu.\n\nThe location is right on Commonwealth Avenue, which is convenient, though parking was a bit difficult to find. We eventually managed to park at meters nearby.\n\nUnfortunately, there seemed to be some miscommunication with the timing of our meals. Four members of our group received their food about 20 minutes before the rest of us. When the remaining two dishes arrived, one was incorrect and had to be sent back (received salmon, not steak as ordered).  The restaurant had run out of the steak featured on the Dine Out menu, so it was replaced with a flat iron steak, which was acceptable to the diner. However, this caused further delays, and by the time the dishes were sorted, the rest of us had finished our meals and were already ready for dessert. This led to an awkward situation where some of us had finished eating while others were still waiting and had to eat alone while everyone watched.\n\nAdditionally, there were some other small issues that added up. The table wasn\u2019t pre-bussed in a timely fashion, and we had to ask for steak knives, which seemed like basic details that were overlooked. It was also difficult to get clarity on who was handling our service, as it seemed like many different people were involved in serving our table, which added to the confusion and inconsistency. Given that the restaurant is owned by James Beard-recognized chefs, this level of service was surprising and disappointing.\n\nOn a positive note, all members of our party seemed to enjoy their drinks, which were a nice touch to the meal.\n\nWhile the service was less than ideal, the food was enjoyable. The steaks were cooked to requested temperature, the fries were crispy, and the salmon was juicy.  Desserts were not overly sweet and portioned to a satisfying amount. To their credit, the restaurant did comp one of the meals off the bill without us asking, which was a nice gesture.\n\nOverall, I hope the service improves, as the food was worth returning for.  However, we won\u2019t be any time soon as there are many other restaurants discover beforehand. Exceptional experience from start to finish. The service was outstanding\u2014attentive, friendly, and efficient without being intrusive. Isabella, our server, was fantastic and added to the overall great experience. She was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations, enhancing our dining experience.\n\nAs for the food, it was nothing short of phenomenal. The paella was perfectly cooked, rich with flavor and generously portioned, while the duck was tender and beautifully seasoned. It's clear that a lot of care goes into both the food and the overall dining experience here. I attended this great restaurant on a busy Valentine\u2019s Day Friday night with my parents and girlfriend. We walked in and they immediately accommodated us with a great window side table. This was so important to me because even on the busiest day, they can find a way to make everyone feel seen. Everywhere I go, I really pride myself on comparing my meals to other dining options I\u2019ve had in Boston. I can definitely say that this is one of the best meals I have had since moving to Boston. I ordered the Steak Frites (Which were delicious) and my girlfriend and parents followed with the same order (Which were equally as mouth watering) We also ordered the Calamari, Brussel Sprouts, and Hummus and loved it as well. The night before, my girlfriend and I attended another restaurant where the service was overlooking us due to our age and treating us as less deserving diners. When we attended Blue Ribbon, they treated us just as important as my parents. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone due to the great service, affordable prices, and GREAT FOOD!\n-Zac The best Oysters Rockefeller I\u2019ve ever had! We tried their Beef Marrow and the Oxtail Marmalade is superb. Our Steak Frites was perfectly cooked.  The drinks and service were amazing too. We had an amazing experience here. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We mostly ordered appetizers and shared amongst 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids) and everyone enjoyed the food. We all love oysters, so we started off with two dozen. Then we had steak tartare, p\u00e2t\u00e9, escargots, bone marrow, and rounded it off with the duck breast entr\u00e9e. 3 of us also had the French onion soup, which was delicious! Actually, everything was delicious! We didn\u2019t have enough room for full dessert, but asked if we could have some vanilla ice cream and our server made it happen. The ambiance is perfect for date nights or a nice dinner with the family. We would definitely come back again. A solid fine dining experience that delivered on all the essentials. We went for the tasting menu with the deluxe wine pairing, and both the food and pairings were spot on. The staff was professional and attentive, adding to the overall high-end experience.\n\nOriginally, we came here for the famous onion soup, but unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t available on the day of our visit\u2014a bit disappointing.\n\nWe also tried the famous $45 martini\u2014definitely overpriced, but admittedly very well-made (though, I guess that\u2019s becoming the norm in Boston).\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a great restaurant for those in the Boston area. I\u2019d recommend it to locals looking for a refined dining experience with excellent service and thoughtful wine pairings. One of the best dining experiences in Boston. Whether seated at the bar with Pamela or a table, you\u2019ll have an experience of this world. The bar is impressively stocked with prime selections for your drinking \ud83c\udf78 pleasure. The seating ranges from private and intimate all the way to social and lively. The food is authentically French \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 , with rich and sharp flavors bursting \ud83d\udca5 from your plate. Dessert surprisingly was my favorite part of the meal as they have a wonderful Souffl\u00e9 \ud83c\udf68that you should try to save room to enjoy. Did I mention they have an outdoor patio with heaters for when the weather is tolerable? Gladly would recommend this place and will visit again! Tried their tasting menu with wine pairings, but overall, the experience was underwhelming. The dishes felt overly cluttered, as if the chef was trying to do too much without clear purpose or harmony. There was also a noticeable repetition in presentation styles and preparation techniques across several courses, which reflected a lack of creativity. The only standout was the fish dish, though it\u2014and the steak\u2014were far too salty. While the steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, it was disappointingly chewy and difficult to cut. Sadly, the meal didn\u2019t quite live up to expectations, and the wine pairings didn\u2019t elevate the experience. The food was another level we enjoyed everything so delicious! So many compliments to the chef. The only thing we like the dessert but  it was not as great as all the food. However 100% recommended we are definitely coming back\ud83e\udd0d Came for our anniversary dinner and it did not disappoint. Customer service, the food, the wine recommendation (Clusel-Roch, Serine), and the pacing were perfect. We got the chef\u2019s tasting menu and every item was phenomenal. The items had seasonal touches which I personally enjoy. My favorite of the night was the Crispy Duck Confit, it came with pumpkin butter, goat cheese creme brulee, frisee orange & sage vinaigrette, and roasted pumpkin seeds. It\u2019s the dish I will think about the most out of the tasting menu. My boyfriend\u2019s favorite was the Spiced Long Island Duck Breast. Other than that, I especially loved the sauces in every dish, the ratios were perfect and complimented everything very well. All very high quality and perfectly cooked meals. Small French inspired restaurant offering brunch & dinner. Went this past weekend for brunch and it was quite satiating. It\u2019s a smaller restaurant, but they turn tables over really quick. I was shocked at both how fast the food came to us, and how delicious it was. Got a beautiful (and tasty) avocado toast with poached eggs, and a duck confit Benedict that was to die for. Coffees we got were also creative, fun, and yummy! Recommended for others to try, and absolutely will be back! We had some of the most delicious brunch plates ever. They also looked stunning. We walked in on a Sunday at noon and were seated 30 mins later. The omelette and avocado toast were the stars of the show. French toast was also very good! The place is super cozy, prices according to size and quality of food, and coffee is also very good. Would totally recommend and come again! Food was delicious we were all very happy with our dishes. Staff was very attentive. Drinks were also great.  I got the salmon, served very hot which is hard to come by for fish dishes, and generous in portion! Mild and flavorful I love this interior design of this cafe, the dood however was a tad bit greasy for me. What I got surprised with though was the staff, this is a relatively expensive cafe, so you\u2019d expect to be treated nicer. The staff almost didn\u2019t talk to us and although the cafe was empty, didn\u2019t even wait for us to catch a breath to bring the check. The French toast and iced strawberry matcha were both delicious and the presentation was beautiful. It gets busy and they don\u2019t take reservations for brunch, but the bar seating is comfy, so it\u2019s not a big deal. Highly recommend! This store is one of the best Dunkin that I go to! The service is fast and the employees are very friendly they get you in and out as fast as possible I love this store in Kenmore thank staff!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 The place is amazing, amazing staff, very fast service, and very clean, I can say that this Dunkin is the best of all I've been to! I had a great experience at this Dunkin\u2019 Donuts location! The food was fresh, warm, and delicious, making my visit even more enjoyable. The store was very clean and well-maintained, creating a pleasant atmosphere. Additionally, the staff was incredibly friendly and polite, providing excellent customer service. I will definitely be coming back! This is the BEST Dunkin in Mass!  The team is always friendly , happy and they remember you!! I go there every day during the week and they always exceed my expectations and remember my order every time!!  Thanks to the Team at 530 Comm Ave for doing an amazing job day in and day out! Chop! Chop! I go to the dunkins in kenmore square and wheh i come through the door when they see me they have my coffee ready bout time i get to counter great service i love it Food came out fast and hot, and they keep the place clean. A bit sloppy making my filet-o-fish sandwich, with the cheese hanging half out the side of the bun. They don\u2019t mix the Oreos into the McFlurry anymore, apparently you have to do that yourself. I know it\u2019s cold out, but do they have to let the homeless malinger and stare inside? Always love having lunch in McDonalds.\nThe location is near my campus and the resto offers plenty discounts.\nI recommend you to order using the McDonalds Apps and you will grab a bang from your bucks.\nFor example, I got the drinks, medium fries, & bacon burger for $7.5 (include tax)\nPlenty tables to sit and there is clean restroom Honestly, the food is quick and easy and I have no complaints. The service can be a little slow and they close off a giant section of the dining room all the time. I\u2019ve hated McDonald\u2019s ever since I bought a burger meal from this location. The burger made me vomit, gave me diarrhea, and caused all the symptoms of food poisoning. It was extremely unhealthy. I strongly recommend that everyone avoid this location. Their staffs are friendly. They are able to send food to your table, and give you ketchup. You can always find a seat, free refills (except McCaf\u00e9), and rest room. If you know how to combine discount, deals and rewards on your app, the cost will not be high. In general my experience here is ok!\nThe chicken mughlai and garlic nan were good!\nMy friends had chicken biryani but they said it wasn't as good as what they had in India (I am not sure in what way) had a very disappointing experience with this restaurant, when I placed an order through Uber Eats. I ordered one Butter Chicken, which came with a free Garlic Naan, and additionally ordered two more Garlic Naans. In total, I should have received three Garlic Naans (which usually come as six pieces), but instead, I only received two pieces\u2014equivalent to just one naan!\n\nNot only was this a clear mistake in my order, but it also completely ruined my meal, as I was left without enough naan to enjoy with my curry. On top of that, the quality of the food itself was underwhelming. The Butter Chicken lacked the rich, creamy texture I was expecting, and the portion size was smaller than what I\u2019ve had at other places.\n\nThis level of carelessness in packing orders is unacceptable, especially when customers are paying extra for additional items. It\u2019s frustrating to not receive what I paid for, and to make things worse, there was no way to immediately resolve the issue. I expected better service and attention to detail, but unfortunately, this experience has left me very disappointed. I won\u2019t be ordering from here again anytime soon. This gem is near the top of our Quality-per-Dollar index.\nThe place has a cozy yet elegant feel, and the staff are kind, attentive and dedicated - and the food is wonderful.\nNorthern Indian cuisine, like other cuisines of India, benefits from the incredible variety of herbs and spices available in the region, and India Quality reflects that. The experience of the food is in the taste of it, a result of the centuries of wisdom that go into the spice combinations, plus the care and dedication of the staff.\nAs cuisines go, Indian food's focus on the taste and texture, but not so much the look of it  (that's true of all Indian and Himalayan cuisines...photos of Indian food are never much to look at), and never the whole story. You have to experience the subtle explosion of textures and flavors in your mouth.\nAnother great feature of Indian cuisine is that they've created a wide variety of vegan and vegetarian options. It's possible to load up on supremely tasty plant protein here.\nThe most remarkable thing about India Quality is the pricing. It almost seems as if their menu prices froze in the '90s - there are appetizers for under $5, and everything is really tasty and great.\nGo! You'll love it. Great food, and the overall experience between the service, vibe, and little details make it worthy of a 5th star.\n\nWe ordered three dishes with lamb, chicken, and paneer and all were delicious.  Came with tasty basmati rice and the garlic naan was delicious.  Also they bring papadam and sauces free at the beginning.\n\nLittle details were surprisingly nice: folded napkins, well prepared table, mint chocolate at the end and guava candies by the door.  The staff were cool people and they provided good service. Had dinner twice here. The waiters are talking to themselves most times in hindi but sometimes it makes you feel like they are talking about you.\nNostalgic Bollywood music is playing all the time, love it!\nMasala chai is top notch and that too with free refills!\nGot samosa chat - complex delicious flavors, good portion size, decent price point.\nBhel puri - the quantity is way less than I expected. Taste is okay. I would go for samosa chat over bhel.\nOrdered kadai paneer both times. It comes with rice so its a full meal in itself. Filling and delicious and does taste like ready to eat tomato paste gravy which I appreciate.\n\nI will visit every time i go back to Boston! I love this place. I had ordered a frozen yogurt with a quite few toppings and girrllllll they hooked it up to the \u2018T\u2019. My man ordered a frappe and it was soooo good and he loved it. The sandwiches we got were the chicken parm and steak n cheese and omg they are so good! I will always order from here, especially for the frozen yogurt because i love their topping choices. I love me some mochi and tapioca on frozen yogurts and they piled it on. I love yall \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude18 Chicken Caesar wrap made perfectly to order!  Clean construction, chicken tasty and tender, lettuce crunchy and fresh, just the right amount of croutons and light on the dressing as requested.  Cheesy fries are perfectly fine but wouldn\u2019t write home about them.\nDelivery was prompt and friendly!\nAm told that it is a popular place to order by nurses and other staff at BID.  My nurse agreed the wraps there are very good. The greatest surprise during our stay in the city. Just perfect food! Flavors were all there FRESH AND TASTY. The service was superb! We decided to purchase many menu items and ALL were superb! Absolutely delicious. Every single dish has its unique distinct fresh taste. We loved everything and will definitely return in the future. Highly recommended \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f The best place to grab a frozen treat! I love their tofu base froyo and smoothies. I really like their pistachio flavor! It\u2019s real nuts blended into the base, and so delicious. Truly perfect for a post-concert snack or something sweet in a sunny day :) I\u2019ve never tried their sandwiches, but they look pretty good too. I'm here with my family and eating the food I already wanted to give a 5 star review I couldn't wait to do it later! The food is wonderful, with great quality. I highly recommend it, you need to give it a chance! Everything was so tasty and creatively delicious! Although sashimi, nigiri and ChowFun were the dishes I'd recommend and re-order. Uni Spoon is very tasty too but I'd prefer to save it for a special occasion!\nNot much else to say other than you gotta try it for yourself~ TLDR: Pricey food but worth the price.\n\nWent by myself and the server was really accommodating. Everything was so delicious. I especially like the potato gnocchi and the foie gras & tuna tartare. Also, I rate sushi restaurant by how fresh their ikura is and I'd say that Uni's ikura is fresh so the restaurant is good And I thought they'd miss on the dessert because it's a sushi restaurant, but the coconut rice pudding was sooo good. They certainly didn't miss. The food came somewhat late, but the server gave me 2 free mocktails as an apology (lol), which I appreciated a lot. Food is on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it. Erin much recommended. Nice place Very nice with an amazing design. Food is amazing and appealing. I recommend uni spoon, Wagyu hot rock and Foie gras. we enjoyed everything so delicious! This is a relatively expensive Japanese restaurant. For the three of us, it averaged $235 per person. We ordered 24 items, plus two cocktails and two desserts.\n\nThe quality of the ingredients is exceptional. Even if you've previously thought other Japanese restaurants had fresh ingredients, this place sets a new standard. The A5 wagyu on the rock was especially impressive, giving me a true taste of melt-in-your-mouth, butter-like wagyu. It was truly astonishing!\n\nThe service was very attentive. The staff were diligent and polite.\n\nWe sat at an outdoor table, watching people pass by, which was quite enjoyable.\n\nParking was challenging. We ended up parking in a nearby garage for $40. Spectacular from start to finish. Service, 5-star. Wagyu cooked at table on hot rock outstanding . Great cocktails . Perfect presentation and food chef's kiss How expensive this place is depends on what you order. The rice bowls (donburi) are quite filling and come with large, thick cuts of tasty raw seafood. But if you want to splurge and go gourmet, this place certainly offers you that option, too. The ambience was pleasant and the service was very attentive, yet not intrusive. Really disappointed with this place. The rice bowl ingredients were clearly not fresh and even had a bitter taste. The steamed egg was completely bland, with no seasoning at all. Despite being labeled as a Japanese restaurant, it\u2019s actually run by Chinese owners, and the flavors do not reflect authentic Japanese cuisine. Would not recommend. The food is very fresh and tasty. Food is slightly expensive for the portion size, and the music is incredibly loud. However the service is amazing and the place is very clean. Incredibly fresh fish! Top tier quality. Closest i\u2019ve found since japan. Fairly priced, good drinks, and truly impressive melt-in mouth tuna and salmon. Nagomi Izakaya is an absolute gem that exceeded all expectations! From the moment we sat down, the experience was nothing short of spectacular. We indulged in a range of dishes, including the wagyu beef scallop, roasted wagyu beef maki, chirashi don, and the torched toro and uni hand rolls, and each dish was an extraordinary delight.

Every bite was a testament to the chef's skill and dedication. To top it all off, the pricing was surprisingly reasonable for the quality of food and service provided. If you're seeking an unforgettable dining experience with top-tier cuisine and warm, inviting service, Nagomi Izakaya is the place to be. Highly recommended! Six of us went together and had a great meal.  It took a while for a server to get us started, but once they came and took our order the food started coming out right away and was excellent.  We shared around family style and could not have been more delighted.  Three of us got lamb, one got chicken and two got the veggie soup.  The soup was very good, but the lamb and chicken were exceptional.  Lovely night. Not too expensive. I had the pleasure of dining at Yemen Restaurant in Boston, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality that made me feel right at home. The atmosphere was cozy yet vibrant, with a beautiful blend of traditional Yemeni decor and modern touches.\n\nThe food was absolutely outstanding! Every dish was bursting with flavor, from the perfectly spiced lamb mandi to the savory chicken makbous. The portions were generous, and everything was made fresh with high-quality ingredients. The hummus and baba ganoush were the perfect starters, and the freshly baked bread was the ideal accompaniment to every dish.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the attention to detail in the flavors \u2013 the blend of spices was perfectly balanced, and each dish felt like a true taste of Yemen. The staff was knowledgeable about the menu and happy to offer recommendations based on what we were in the mood for.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Boston and craving authentic Yemeni cuisine, this place is an absolute must-visit. I can\u2019t wait to return and try more dishes from their incredible menu. Highly recommend! Delicious and authentic Yemeni food. We sat on the floor and it felt so comfortable and authentic! Great family run service. Lamb was very tender, there are no knives.. felt a little fatty and lacked salt, but still very good. Salad was delicious, drizzled with a sweet balsamic glaze. If you want the big bread you see in the pictures, make sure you order it from the appetizer menu, it didn\u2019t come with our meal. Hummus very good, strong taste of tahini Tried their sit-down experience, and it felt cozy and authentic!\nThe servers were great, and we took our time enjoying the meal and good conversation.\n\nWe started with three types of hummus-& dips (tomato, yogurt, and lamb) with fresh pita. absolutely exceptional!!\n\nNext, we had fresh bread with chicken stew, which was just okay, felt more like a veggie stew. Other stews looked better, but we stuck to chicken due to dietary restrictions.\n\nFinally, we had mandi chicken biryani, different but good. The meat was incredibly moist, and the rice was fluffy.\nWould definitely go again to try their lamb dishes. If you're in Boston and craving authentic Yemeni cuisine, Bab Al-Yemen is an absolute must-visit. From the rich flavors of the mandi and haneeth to the warm, traditional d\u00e9cor, the whole experience feels like a trip to Yemen.\n\nThe food is full of bold, comforting spices and generous portions\u2014perfect for sharing. The fresh bread straight from the clay oven and the fragrant rice dishes are highlights you won\u2019t forget.\n\nDefinitely make sure to make a reservation, especially on Friday and Saturday, as it gets very busy. The popularity is well-earned, and you won\u2019t want to miss out. Whether you're going with family or friends, it\u2019s a flavorful, cultural experience you\u2019ll want to come back to. This place has good food for a reasonable price (creative hot dogs and good burgers). Was not a fan of the amount of fries or Brussels sprouts (which were tasty) for the price.\nThe breakfast hot dog was a combination of flavors I wouldn\u2019t have anticipated for a hot dog and something I will attempt to remake at home. Burgers were bar burgers, not huge, just enough and for the price well worth it in Boston. The turkey burger had some great flavors with the toppings and needed that flavor. It had quite the kick.\nHospitality was good too. Very welcoming and attentive.\nRecommend to stop here for a quick, fairly inexpensive bite. One of the best Bar in town\nThe waiters & waitresses are so friendly\nThere are plenty tables so u don't need to queue\nI really love the nachos, big portion and affordable price\nU can enjoy the hockey games and hanging out till night\nWould love to come back to this bar yeah Great bar food, no complaints at all during our time here. We got in when it was terrible weather outside and extremely packed inside. They were welcoming and tried to find us seats as quickly as possible. The service was kind and quick, as our food (K burgers and fries) were out within 10-15 minutes even while they were extremely busy. The value to money is great here. A tasty not-so-expensive burger For a quick drink, or a quick burger and fries, it's a great spot to hit right off the Green Line. 1 minute walk from Kenmore Station.\n\nThe Burger was great, no complaints on the food for the price.\n\nPlenty of options for drinks if you like beer or liquor and the bench seating on the back wall is a nice touch.\n\nThe bartender was friendly, super inviting, and anticipated our needs without being pushy, definitely a chill person who made us feel welcome right away.\n\nI'd definitely stop again on my way out of Boston! Worth the quick stop. Stopped at Cornwall!s after Red Sox game. Atmosphere was good. Very busy but service provided was very good.\nMy wife had the clam chowder which was very tasty. However on recommendation of our waiter my daughter and I had the fish and chips. We were quite disappointed. There was very little flavour to the fish. Batter was just ok. I have had much better fish and chips at many other places.\nFor $ 24.00 each we were expecting a meal more enjoyable. Looking for an irish pub this will work. Stopping in for drinks and a quick bite... Was enjoyable, there was an issue with the staff however, the we had several wait staff just walk by us over never stop as ask, we had to wave someone down. Further, the waitress in our section was upset about something - maybe mad at the world?. Either way was enjoyable no matter how pissy the staff was. We came here after a B.U. graduation, and everything was thoroughly enjoyable.  Food-wise, the fish & chips, grilled reuben, and turkey club were all tasty. Drink-wise, the espresso martinis were well received, and my favorite beer was the oatmeal brown.  Service was friendly and helpful, both at the tables and at the bar. Great place to have private event. The food is so delicous, I love the turkey wrap & chicken fringers.\nThere are plenty tables & waiters are really helpful. Exactly what they said it was. English pub atmosphere without any pretentiousness. Thick  chowdah lovers - this one is for you. Perfect spot to slug $8 beers before the $13 beers at Fenway."

    "reviews": "This is quite literally the worst and most incompetent doctors office and pharmacy I have ever experienced. The woman who works in the pharmacy ought to be fired and have charges pressed against her for the way she speaks to people, handles issues, and refuses to work with patients and makes it incredibly difficult to fill people\u2019s prescriptions. Virtually downright refusing to do what she\u2019s paid to do. The doctors are inattentive and dismissive and hardly reply to messages sent through the app.. which is the only method of contact unless the doctor calls you. I absolutely cannot deal with this doctors office and I\u2019m happy they\u2019re not my provider (family member). If I could give them several million less starts than one, I would. Their purpose and mission are admirable but they should probably get their shit together before they get slapped with a lawsuit. If you can find another LGBTQIA+ care provider, please go elsewhere! The people at the counter always sound annoyed and take such a long time to help me cause they're busy talking at the back. There's this one lady in particular that will always be laughing while helping others and then she turns to me and becomes the rudest person ever (sometimes I wonder if she's being discriminatory because of my race, and I don't say this lightly).\n\nThe overall process is quick and it's a convenient location but I dread going for my refills everytime. I'd give negative reviews if I could. I picked up a medication for the first time at this pharmacy. The cashier bent over and clicked \u201cNo\u201d on the screen when I was reading the prompt that asked if I\u2019d like counseling for the medication. I asked the cashier how often I should take the medication. Instead of having the pharmacist tell me the instructions, she said \u201cit should be on there,\u201d referring to the bottle. I am so shocked my the level of unprofessionalism. The customer should be told instructions for their medication verbally, and especially if they ask for it. 1/5 stars, I would give my experience negative stars if I could. Due to a \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d they\u2019ve gaslit me for weeks insisting my script was already filled when it absolutely was not, so I\u2019ve been without my medication for a long time. I am furious. There is zero accountability for the damage to my health and my life. Really disappointed in them lately, used to be a great mail order pharmacy but it\u2019s gotten to the point that I need a paper trail to keep track of who said what, can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve been told something was in the mail when they 1) had not mailed it yet and 2) forgot to do so.\n\nBetter than the local cvs but not by much I waited in line for approximately 10 minutes under the sign that said \"Vaccine Check-In.\" When it was finally my turn, I asked the staff member to check me in, only to be told I needed to complete the process on my phone. This was after I had already waited patiently in line. The CVS app\u2019s check-in system was confusing and not user-friendly. To make matters worse, I saw other customers in the same line receiving assistance with their check-ins, while I was left to manage it on my own.\n\nAfter finally completing the check-in process with other person, I noticed that individuals who arrived after me were being called for their vaccinations before me. When I tried to inform the nurse administering the vaccinations that I was still waiting and might not be on the list, I was completely ignored. To add to the frustration, I saw another customer, a white man who arrived after me, come out of the vaccination room ahead of me.\n\nAfter waiting for a total of 20-30 minutes with no resolution, I had to leave as I had another appointment nearby. This experience was extremely frustrating, and I am deeply disappointed with both the lack of professionalism and the inefficient process at this CVS location. My daughter who goes to college in that area got there at 620p.m. She stood in line waiting for them to finish with one customer ahead of her.  Didn't finish till 700 pm with the gentleman infront of her. Her turn was at exactly 700 pm and they turned her away. I am beyond pissed that they did that  especially because she needed those meds.   What kind of people work at this cvs?   Get more staff or take the people that were waiting over 40 min +100 to all the 1 stars. Samantha the pharmacist didn\u2019t bother to help the other cashier despite a long line and the time was close to their shutdown. Then she refused to take the time to resolve an issue with my medication even though I offered to pay out of pocket to simplify things (\u201cit\u2019s 7 pm and I\u2019ve to close the registers\u201d) and asked me to go to another pharmacy a mile away. Somebody needs to eliminate her role to teach her the value of having a job. terrible employees. there will be like 5 behind the counter and no one to actually ring people out that are trying to pick up prescriptions. can you retrain them to work a computer? maybe? theres five pharmacists on a Sunday afternoon and Wendy is doing paper crafts at the register while two customers wait 30 minutes to pick up prescriptions that were ready, and filled (that I called to make sure were ready, to prevent this situation, incase it happened. before I went to pickup) I came in around 12:30, with one girl in front of me. I thought I might have to wait till Wendy got back from lunch. Unprofessional with potential for errors. Name and date of birth not verified for vaccine administration by Pharmacist who was not wearing a badge (record shows it was Samantha who is mentioned in other reviews) and did not confirm the vaccine being administered. 1.

I go here to get milk when I run out and don\u2019t feel like going to Star Market or Target. The store is not a place to go late night as there are some people who lurk around constantly asking for money or cigarettes. Talk to the people nice and they look at you like they hate being here . Weather your buying.g or picking up a order .. you have one job just do it. Don't waste people's time .. show some respect Terribly managed and often scams their customers (double charged on lottery tickets lol) There is staff working inside. and the store is locked July 15 at night at 3 o\u2019clock This is a good Target if you're in the Back Bay, South End or Kenmore area but parking is limited. Two floors of everything that you may need for yourself, your home and a mini supermarket included. There's also a Starbucks and a CVS pharmacy. Disgusting and poorly managed grocery section. Fruit left out that has been molding for days. New anti-theft \"technology\" means even quick trips take longer while you wait for an employee to unlock socks for you. Not many other places to go in Fenway but I'd still advise against I received an excellent, absolutely outstanding assistance today from the tech/cellphone specialist named Tasha, who was staffing the Tech section at this Target location. I came to Target today with the objective of switching my phone service from Verizon (where I was a customer for the past 21 years, but experienced some major problems with them in the past two weeks, from which I was very stressed out) to Consumer Cellular which operates through Target stores. Tasha was incredibly helpful, taking me smoothly through this process of buying a new phone and switching cellphone carriers (which was quite complicated, due to some issues at Verizon, but in the end it did not feel so bad at all, due to Tasha's patient and knowledgeable help). I really did not expect such a highly positive experience and highly professional help when dealing with complicated cellphone issues at a general-purpose department store such as Target! But this lady, Tasha, is an exceptional employee who deserves the highest praise for outstanding customer service! Between the lack of employees on the floor and merchandise being locked up due to theft it's always something with this location. I frequent here a lot only for the simple fact that it's the one closest to my house, but this past Sunday blew the hell outta me! My Iphone 15 was stolen from the guest service desk that I walked away from for less than 5 minutes then returned when I realized and the workers acted oblivious. The short light skin boy at the security booth near the entrance checked footage and confirmed a \"customer\" stole it then just stared at me in silence like he was slow. I was asking about descriptions and time stamps, it was like pulling teeth to get information. When I asked if the individual was still in the store because I had just passed her, he claimed to be unsure. I came back 30 mins later asking about security footage and he said due to privacy reasons I wasn't allowed, but I can file a police report(which I did) and they can view the footage (knowing damn well police aren't gonna do anything)and take the necessary measures from there. He then confirmed that once I left he rolled back the footage again in which the individual was still in the store at the time that I originally asked him. Once the evidence was confirmed, the immediate next steps should have been looking to see if the individual was still in the store. I should have never had to ask simple questions to get clarity he should have already been on it, because by that time it was too late. In all seriousness I could've gotten my phone back. And with the lack of information that I was pulling for, I'm supposed to actually believe a customer truly stole it and not an employee? Okay. Nonetheless his self awareness sucked in that moment, so clearly they have them yellow reflective jackets for the aesthetic cuz they never look to be securing a damn thing up in there whenever I go anyway. The way everything is locked up and the store looks a mess confirms that! Great setup and very helpful people! The gentleman fulfilling an online order helped us with a product that wasn\u2019t stocked in the shelves by going to the back and bringing the laptop charger we so badly needed. Very helpful and nice. Need to hire more people like him! I've been getting my haircut here since moving this past summer. Noah B is an excellent barber and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a haircut. He is attentive to detail and you can tell he really takes his time to give you a final result youoo be satisfied with. Not to mention he's a very nice and friendly person so engage in conversation with! If you need a haircut in the Boston area make sure to swing by Noah's chair! This place is great! They do a very professional job! I've had my hair done several times here from different barbers every time and all of them were really good and I didn't have any issues. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great haircut. Special shout out to Noah who always makes me look super fresh. Thank you guys! When it comes to a haircut I only want the best of the best cutting my hair. I\u2019ve had a lot of bad experiences in the past, and I did a lot of research before I stumbled upon this shop. This shop has a lot of talent but out of all the barbers  Roy stood out to me. I booked an appointment and tried my luck with him. Two years later I\u2019m still consistently getting my haircuts by him. He is very attentive and profesional and he always keeps me looking great. I\u2019m always getting compliments on my haircuts and I feel really confident leaving the shop. I highlight recommend him! I have been going here for over a year now and it really shows that people come here consistently. It has a great family vibe and everyone is so friendly and nice. Personally, I always go with Roy and I've always loved my cut from day one. I'm sure the other barbers are amazing as well but its hard to find one like Roy who kills it every time. I visited this location today to purchase items that I have bought over and over again from Sephora. Naturally, I knew where the products were and did not need help from the employees. I also did a bit of browsing for any new products I wanted to try and felt a pair of eyes piercing through me the entire time I was browsing. I felt like I was crazy and that I may have looked suspicious, but after coming on here and reading the many reviews about the SAME SITUATION, I felt validated for my anxiety. Like the other reviews, I understand the need for security, but it does not promote a positive shopping experience when being followed around just because you don't need help from an employee. The entire time, I made sure to have the products I was purchasing out and in view so I would not cause any suspicions. But after I got into line to pay, I was STILL being watched by the same security guard. I don't see how this is necessary as I LITERALLY GOT INTO LINE. I do not plan on returning to this location for these reasons. I have not had this same experience at any other Sephora location. Please do better. pls tell ur security guard to stop following people around who are actually trying to shop. I get it that it\u2019s for security reasons, but to have him following me and maybe other people around like a lost puppy is crazy. Also AGAIN i know it\u2019s protocol to ask people \u201cif they need help\u201d but like i had 4 \u201cFOUR\u201d different workers come up to me in less than 15 mins. I was supposed to buy a concealer but ended up with a serum and anxiety of walking into your store again. Please it gets to a point of doing all of this. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a racial issue or whatever. I\u2019m sorry to anybody who\u2019s ever felt like this if they\u2019ve been here or any other Sephora. This store truly cares about security but it gets to a point where it\u2019s too  serious. I\u2019ve been to this location more than 3+ times. This literally feels like the first time i think that this truly happened to me. Never had a sephora worker ask me for help knowing I don\u2019t NEED ANY. Then not even 2 minutes after another pops up when I move from a different aisle. She ask me the same question but here\u2019s what\u2019s different. I have the bald security guard who is literally breathing behind my neck making sure i\u2019m not doing any \u201csuspicious\u201d . (I was smelling perfume). The worker and security stood there until I asked another worker when the Benefit was because of how uncomfortable it felt. I was just trying to have a good time. Truly the worst sephora. Maybe an age issue or racial. Stop asking me if I need help. No do yalls workers need help. Worst works as well So i live in the Fenway neighborhood on the same street as this Sephora. I stopped in for the first time on Christmas Eve with my 6 year old to grab a concealer really quick. While I was there I felt extremely uncomfortable because I was being watched as I searched for my concealer.  It was so disgusting to be racially profiled in this way w my young daughter that I knew I had to write a review. Even when I was in line to pay I was being watched!!! It was unbelievable first time experience at my neighborhood Sephora that I will now go to the prudential location moving forward even though this one is STEPS from home!! SHAME!! I went into Sephora today and received subpar customer service, if you would call what they did customer service. I was pointed in the direction of the product I needed couldn\u2019t find and no one was willing helping to point out where the product was. It was a fenty highlighter that I was looking for. When I went up to pay for my product there was no greeting nor anything remotely close to being friendly. This store is close to my job but I will not be returning id rather make the troop to Braintree where I feel appreciated as a consumer and not treated as though I\u2019m a bother to people who work in a place and get paid to work there. a staff member named Jakiah(forgive me if i spelled it wrong!) was so extremely wonderful !!! i brought someone special with me to this location to add some things into their skincare routine. Jakiah mentioned that she was an esthetician too which was also comforting to hear!!! we shared our skincare concerns with her and she gave us so much advice and guidance, i didn't feel pushed at all to buy anything, which was really wonderful compared to previous sales experiences i've had. she noticed we were interested in purchasing mini sizes and also was able to recommend us products with mini-sizes too, exactly what we were looking for! I've been a rouge member for (almost!) a decade with all kinds of in-store and online shopping experiences, and as someone who works in service and sales too, thank you Jakiah for the great experience :') the dedication, care and gentleness she has for her work shows even in short encounters. i hope the best for her and especially hope that she gets paid fairly too  I've been getting my haircut here since moving this past summer.

The store is only open on matchdays but the main one down the road is much bigger and has more choice. It can get very busy in here when a game is on. Thunderstorm warning in the area, and they made everyone exit the store in the middle of it. Were I come from, we care about people and would NEVER push them away in the middle of a storm. Not these gals. Heartless and cruel. I'll never step foot in there again. The Red Sox game got rain delayed and we were crowding in front of the door because it was pouring down rain. But they starting yelling get out of the door frame and basically go stand in the rain. They were also screaming at little kids when I was in there. When I was in there also It was super rude customer service. Pouring down rain and instead of being compassionate, all these folks could do was to yell about blocking their door, including kids. Keep your merchandise and learn some manners! Extremely rude people working there, will never shop there again. Best store in the world to buy Red Sox Memorabilia !\nWe really enjoyed this store it had everything, and it was air conditioned so really nice during a warm Boston summer day!\nHighly recommended although (obviously) the visit will cost you a few hundred dollars. Nice store, huge store actually!!! They had a lot of stuff. Pretty much everything you could buy inside Fenway Park and more! Lots of different clothing choices to choose from too many different styles. The place was packed! Very very busy hard to move around. And the prices were outrageous. $10 for a small stress ball. An awesome store filled with lots of great Red Sox memorabilia. This is the best place to get your baseball souvenirs and there is such a large store with so much to choose from. Whole Red Sox experience was nothing but nostalgia. Awesome team store, unfortunately no Duran jerseys in blue or red which was super disappointing. As a lifelong pirates fan and resident of Ohio the entire day I spent in Fenway was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. Kind of sucks this place has a monopoly on the city and there are absolutely no other places to get merchandise that aren\u2019t owned by this store which may be 2 other places in the whole city. In Pittsburgh there\u2019s 20 or more places to get Pittsburgh merchandise with more options and better stock of product. Also can\u2019t find anywhere to buy Red Sox autographs, Pittsburgh has dedicated websites you can pre-order players autos throughout the season. Overall the nostalgia of Boston is unlike any other and an amazing amazing experience. Merchandise is limited so if you\u2019re looking for something unique and not overpriced you may want to order online. I have never seen a pro sports team store as expansive as this. Opening it across the street and having it accessible on game days was a great idea. not convenient any more, over charges for all fee's,  .\nthey charged me 100 dollars to transfer a credit card balance to their bank.\nToo Big !\nCanada's version of Spains Sandender and American version of B.O.A.... Actually terrible staff here. Hung up on me during a phone call and was extremely rude. Not the same as it was years ago. Customer service here has gone downhill. I deposited a check on August 10th, the transaction appears to be August 12th on my app and I was okay with that. But now it is August 20th and my money is still on hold. The app says just 6 bus days hold. I went to ask a banker if there was any problem with my check, he just was quiet, pushed a few buttons and finally showed me a calendar. He started counting the days for me in a form like I didn't know how to count them, ending with \"today is day 6, you have to wait until the next business day to have your money\". Why does it take so long for a nationwide bank to run a clearance on a check from a university? I'm regretting opening an account with this bank and not being told to cash the check instead of depositing it. The way the banker talked to me was disrespectful and he didn't even give me options for making my money available early. That check is my stipend from university, and I have bills to pay but the bank doesn't even care. There was no empathy with customers, and the banker made me feel like stupid. tried to open a bank account. sebastian said yes. I sat down. \u201cdo you have two forms of id?\u201d \u201cyes\u201d a couple of minutes later \u201cwe\u2019re actually pretty understaffed and I\u2019m the only teller so it might not happen\u201d \u201chow long does it take\u201d \u201c15-20 minutes\u201d\n\nI\u2019m good. mans was just looking for an excuse to go home imo. Came on a Sunday\u2014place was clean and spacious. The customer service rep Steven was friendly and funny. They let me stay 20 minutes pass closing time to wrap up the task. Wouldn\u2019t have had time Mon-Fri to go, very thankful for the customer service! Quaint brunch spot on the edge of a part of town with a wide variety of restaurants. Great crab eggs Benedict and Cajun chicken tenders. Sidewalk patio on a bustling little intersection. Great service here, and good food at affordable prices Thornton Fenway grille had a lot of taste items at fantastic prices. I was happily surprised by how much we got for my dollar. The place has both inside and outside seating. We sat at a clean table inside.\n\nI ordered chicken sandwich with some french fries. It was absolutely delicious. It had a great bite. Since it was affordable, my friend and I shared vanilla ice cream with strawberries. It was probably healthy dessert out of bunch. Wise tip is to add fruit to any ice cream. I highly recommend it here for quick bite. Or just relax with a drink. Pretty solid American diner vibes. Reasonably priced. Eggs Benedict were wonderful. Service was really good. Would come again sometime Biked here after hearing good things about it online. We ordered Jerry's missing fingers and potato skins but they were out of potato skins so I ended up getting Buffalo fingers too. The first set of Jerry's fingers ended up seeming burnt so we sent them back and they offered to replace them with what ended up being much better cooked. Overall there was a lot of salt on everything but it was still fairly good. This is probably a good classic pub for people looking for a frosty pint and classic bar food. Not exactly perfect and not exactly for me. A corner stone of Fenway neighborhood. I worked there 20+years ago, and just went for the first time in 10 years. Everything was just as great as when I worked there. Fantastic menu of fresh cooked, quality ingredients, cooked with care for a fantastic final product!\n\nHighly recommend the ribeye sandwich, chicken fingers, baked brie, big dig, any of the sandwiches are always great. Consistency like this is hard to come by these days! Their Saigon banh mi was exactly what I needed after a hangover. Sooo delicious. I will say it was a very long wait but the barista + staff were attentive and apologetic. Their drinks were flavorful and unique. Gluten free pastries also available! We were excited to try this place after seeing everyone else\u2019s photos/reviews, but we ended up being very disappointed. We had spent $45 on 3 lattes, 2 buns, and 1 banh mi. The iced saigonese was pretty good. The matcha latte was good too; good quality matcha, just wasn\u2019t sweetened when we asked for it to be sweetened. The iced phin ube didn\u2019t have any ube flavor in it. It just tasted like a regular c\u00e0 ph\u00ea s\u1eefa \u0111\u00e1. We ordered the lemongrass beef banh mi and the baguette was not toasted and it was hard to chew. The biggest disappointment was the matcha and ube buns we ordered. We asked for both to be warmed with the custard filling. The buns were not warmed up and actually tasted stale. They cut the buns open like a bagel and spread the custard in like it was butter. We really wanted to like this place, but the quality was terrible. Good value for money - coffee was a bit too sweet for my personal preference but it was great. Ube tiramisu stole the show; reminded us of the ube back in the Philippines. Good spot for Vietnamese snacks and coffee! I tried the Iced Saigonese, which was pretty sweet even with ordering a less-sweet one, but was overall yummy! My only complaint is I wish I could taste the sea salt foam more, pretty much only sweet came through.\n\nOverall a fairly good Vietnamese coffee spot when I\u2019m in the area, worth coming back for the food! The matcha here is the most authentic and is amazing! It\u2019s a warning for the sweet matcha latte lovers, it\u2019s pretty strong and for people who really enjoy good matcha, so don\u2019t complain. The coffee is great, ube latte was good too. The banh mi was dry but okay overall. Drinks were great. Ube bun was overrated and tasted nothing like ube. Excellent thai food, very homey atmosphere, great value for money. Bangkok Duck was incredibly crispy and juicy. Delicious Thai Food in Town. The price is affordable, the service is fast (only need approximately 10 minutes from the payment until the food is served on your table), and the workers are friendly. The resto is clean, including the restroom. Plenty tables to sit inside and outside the resto, so u don't need to queue for dining in.\nI ordered large crispy chicken with sweet chili sauce, large shrimp tom yum, and rice for $41.89. The portion was so big, so my friend and I needed to take some home. In my opinion, the large portion was for 3 people. Delicious Thai food in the area. Popular among students. Ordered duck fried rice, pork belly with vegetables over rice and seafood fried wide noodles. Got outdoor seatings. Rod Thai Family Taste offers a large menu with plenty of tasty vegan options. Of note, many of the vegetarian items can be made vegan upon request. We especially enjoyed the cashew nut stir fry (pictured) and the red curry. Order at the counter and food is brought to your table. Service is fast and staff is friendly. The indoor eating area boasts large windows with nice natural light and a laid back and cozy atmosphere. There are a number of picnic tables outside for outdoor dining. The street is reasonably quiet, so we prefer outside when the weather is nice - great casual summer evening dining option. I ordered pad pak chicken and thai ice tea. The service was quick, and the portion they serve is big. The food, both taste and texture, is on point, the portions are very big for what you pay for. The atmosphere is... really it's mostly a place to pick up the good food to go elsewhere but they do have cramped seating for roughly 20 people. This place has a very casual and fun vibe. The staff greets you with a big smile. The menu is not too large but big enough to make you want to order everything!\n\nI never heard of Mexican sandwiches but glad I tried it. It was amazing! Their tacos and plantains are blasting with flavors! So glad we found this place. Let\u2019s be real. Boston isn\u2019t exactly overflowing with great Mexican restaurants, and when it comes to Fenway, it feels like a desert. El Pelon used to be the most decent one in the area, but its quality has gone down in the past few years. I used to order their Platos for delivery occasionally, but I recently had a bad experience with the pork and chicken platos. Both meats were dry, and the toppings lacked the punch of flavor you'd expect. Even compared to local chains like El Jefe\u2019s, it fell flat. The Steak Platos I tried during lunch were a slight improvement, but not enough to quench my Mexican cravings.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that El Pelon is still considered the best takeout Mexican option near Fenway. Not sure if I\u2019ll be going back. Was recommended the El guapo burrito. Tasted great! Good flavour and i think there was banana or some kinda fruit in there which i found rly unique! It was really affordable as well. Even more significant for me though was that the service was topnotch. The lady who served me was all smiles and v friendly. She even went out of her way when I asked for a favor regarding keeping my backpack safe for an hour as I couldn't have it w me. To my surprise she accepted. If you're reading this I want to say thank you again. I can't commend them and recommend them enough!! Amazing fish tacos with an interesting twist! Love the cucumbers and the sauce which has a little bit of spice. The staff were very friendly and the facilities are clean. Plantains were also great. Good portion. We ordered the appetizer combo so we can try everything out, the fried shrimp and chicken satay are good. The Pad Thai is just too sweet, it maybe good to balance the spice but still, the sweetness out stands the flavor.\nService is a little bit slow but nice.\n\nAffordable and maybe try to order more spicier ones to bring out more flavors The food was good a little too condimented specially  the khao soi. Thai tea is also really sweet so wouldn\u2019t order it again. The wong tong soup was great! And the roasted duck\nWas super crispy amazing portion would highly recommend it. The fried rice we ordered was okay the proteins weren\u2019t very chopped and the flavor was just fine also not many vegetables on it. One of the few Thai restaurants in USA that is not overly priced but really good tasting. Food also comes in good amount of size. The servers are also attentive to your needs. I would recommend to visit this quaint restaurant if you\u2019re visiting one of the museums nearby! Sauces are amazing, Staff is very kind and good problem solvers.\nOur 4 dishes wer unique and very tasteful, superior to similar restaurants.\nLovely place to eat after a visit to the museum. The taste is really good.! I usually come here and order Chicken Satay, Tod Mun, Mango sticky and Fried Ice-cream. I like the temperature, taste and service. I can take my time to enjoy my foods. And the taste is similar in Thailand. Highly recommended.! I got a Rigatoni, Pesto, with sundried tomatoes, chicken, and grated cheese on the top. The ingredients were fresh, especially the sauce. The pasta was well done. When i ate it, it was a flavor explosion. I would highly recommend this place! I had an amazing experience at BE Pasta Bar. The place is clean, welcoming, and the service is top-notch. Their fresh pasta is incredible, and I had the Chicken Caesar Salad, which was a perfect combination of crisp greens and tender chicken. The homemade sauce just adds to the overall experience. The Buffalo Mac n Cheese was also very flavorful. Definitely one of my new favorite spots! BE Pasta Bar is a hidden gem! I\u2019ve been here a few times, and each visit has been fantastic. The fresh pasta is always cooked to perfection, and their homemade sauce is absolutely delicious. The Chicken Parm Sandwich is a must-try, and the Tomato Soup is the perfect starter. It\u2019s a clean, cozy spot with a great vibe, and I love how they make their own pasta and sauces. Highly recommend! BE Pasta Bar is my new favorite pasta shop! They make their own pasta, and you can taste the difference. The Chicken Caesar Salad was fresh, and the Chicken Parm Sandwich was deliciously satisfying. The Tomato Soup is perfect for starting your meal. The staff is always so welcoming, and the place has a cozy vibe that makes it even better. Every time I eat at BE Pasta Bar, I\u2019m blown away by the quality of the food. The fresh pasta is cooked to perfection, and the homemade sauce is rich and flavorful. The Buffalo Mac n Cheese is my go-to comfort food, and the Chocolate Cake is the perfect way to finish the meal. I had the pleasure of partnering with The Harlo as a vendor to serve smoothies to their residents, and the experience was absolutely fantastic! From the moment I arrived, the staff was incredibly welcoming, organized, and supportive. The residents were equally warm and enthusiastic, which made the entire event so enjoyable.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that this company truly values creating meaningful experiences for their community. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it and look forward to working together again in the future. Highly recommend! We\u2019ve absolutely loved living at The Harlo! The amenities are top-notch, from the well-equipped fitness center to stylish common areas that make working from home or relaxing with friends and family a breeze. The community events are a fantastic bonus\u2014whether it\u2019s a social gathering or a fun activity, they really help foster a sense of connection among residents.\n\nWhat truly sets The Harlo apart, though, is the incredible staff. From the front desk team to maintenance, everyone is friendly, responsive, and always willing to go the extra mile to make sure residents feel at home. This community is truly one of a kind\u2014vibrant, welcoming, and full of energy. The residents are fantastic, and it\u2019s always a pleasure to bring our Italian coffee experience to such a wonderful space.\nThe staff at The Harlo are incredibly friendly and responsive, ensuring that every event runs smoothly. The amenities here are top-notch, and the sense of community is unmatched, with great engagement events that bring people together. I've been living at the Harlo for close to two years now and it is a fantastic place to live. There are a lot of activities to do and the amenities are nice. Manny the front desk receptionist really makes this a 5 star place to live though! He is super knowledgeable about all questions you may have regarding the building, packages, or living here. The Harlo is more than just an apartment\u2014it\u2019s home. The staff truly cares, and it shows in everything they do. Manny at the concierge makes everyone feel welcome, and Sobner from maintenance is always there when you need him, going above and beyond to help. It\u2019s rare to find a place where the people make such a difference, but at The Harlo, they do. Grateful to be a resident here!\n\u2014 Leo G Basho is consistently well-prepared and delicious! I work in the area and buy both dine-in and takeout regularly. My favorite is their spicy tuna roll. I'd argue that it's the best in Boston. Their ingredients are always fresh and their entire team is very service-oriented. Their lunch menu, especially the salmon okonomi set, is worth a try. Great lunch spot! The food was amazing! We enjoyed a variety appetizers, sushi, and a flavorful hot stone pot (highly recommend) and finished with some delicious dessert. Everything was fresh, well prepared and full of flavor. The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend! I payed for an extra fried egg for the fried rice then I wrote on the instructions \u201cplease make the extra fried egg scrambled\u201d. They give me a fried egg with runny yolk. I didn\u2019t ask for that to be demanding, I asked for it BECAUSE at this point it is not SAFE for my health to eat runny yolk. Please do better, it doesn\u2019t cost you anything to read the instructions and make a simple adjustment for someone who paid $3 for an extra egg, it\u2019s less than a minute off your day!! Fortunately GRUBHUB refunded me for the egg at least. This is ridiculous! I liked the pork ramen a lot, the broth was flavorful! So was the miso soup \ud83d\ude0b We came here for dinner with a large group and it was mostly empty. We had a great time and everything was delicious!\n\nWe got the Matcha Matcha and Mango Whisky drinks, both of which were super good, looked beautiful, but weren't very strong. For apps, the tuna tartare was the most tasty. We got an assortment of the special sushi rolls and honestly they were all super delicious.\n\nThe service was prompt and knowledgeable; the ambiance was hip. I would come back here again! Possibly the best pizza I\u2019ve ever had. I really wasn\u2019t expecting it to live up to the hype because I thought it looked like other pizzas I\u2019d had before, but I was wrong.\n\nThe base had a great crispy texture, the sauce was full of flavour. And the toppings were incredible. I ate it too quickly and it was piping hot but that\u2019s my fault.\n\nDon\u2019t skip out on this place. It\u2019s a must. The food is good typical of Regina\u2019s ,  love it .  We been coming here a lot lately for lunch . The service is ok . Beware , because when you pay with your card , they put in a tip feature that ; is hard to bypass.  I find this sneaky \ud83d\ude08, maybe they don\u2019t mean it but , I couldn\u2019t bypass it .   The atmosphere is ok.  I waited in the establishment 20 minutes for a large cheese not too bad. TLDR: Pizza good. Service fair. To-go box terrible.\n\nPizza is decent. If you\u2019re waiting for pizza to come out of the oven and ask for a salad, they should prepare your salad, not wait for the pizza to come out to only then start preparing your salad. Also, they REALLY need to improve those one-slice to-go boxes. They let the grease through as soon as they put the slice in, so it ends up in your hands or anywhere you lay down the box. You also can\u2019t stack them or they collapse and the cheese ends up sticking to the paper (gross). Pizza is mediocre, buffalo chicken wraps were disgusting (the blue cheese taste like it was sitting for a while or past expiration)\nService was ok, the girl was nice but the guys were stand-offish, like they didn\u2019t want you to be there.\nAtmosphere was ok, very dark & empty but at least it looked clean upfront If you want cardboard pizza, come here!  After having tried the amazing pizza at Regina's in the north end, I was sorely disappointed by this location.  How is the north end one so good but this one so bad? Fantastic dining. We stayed at The Verb hotel, right down the block. Open late and delicious. We ended up going twice, knew it would be great service and great food. Steak frites and fish and chips 5 stars!!! Great charcuterie board too. Absolutely fantastic place. The whisky and whiskey selections are fantastic though the beer selection was a little reduced thanks to St Patrick's Day weekend I'm sure. My friend got the 'Ideal Manhattan' and enjoyed it so much, she got a second one.\nWe also got the Tuna Tartare since we weren't super hungry and that was fantastic as well. This is a great spot and near enough Fenway to walk when you want something more than a hot dig Came here for a bday party. The pig roast done family style is great. The pig itself was perfectly cooked with tender meat and good crackling skin. The sides were also excellent: carrots, cauliflower, corn, Mac and cheese, and sausage stuffing that was amazingly flavorful! Cozy boothes here for drinks. They let us turn their non alcoholic drink into alcoholic with some spirit which was nice. Good drinks but the fried pickles were awful. They were very sour and just bad... Amazing! Went during a vacation on a weeknight. Tuna tartare, oysters and steak frites. Great service and large whiskey menu. Delicious cocktails. There was a mixup on the prices of the whiskey pours and the bar manager made it right for us - great service. Haven\u2019t had one in years since I moved from NYC . I\u2019ve seen them on phantom gourmet and knew that one day I would have to go and try . Wasn\u2019t disappointed. Thank you guys . I had the pork sandwich with fries inside and one for my wife . If you go bring someone else one too . Great prices too One of the best Greek restaurants I have been to. You get a good 3-4lbs of food for $13 which is amazing. The meat, rice, falafel, french fries and gyro are all so good. If you have a big stomach and enjoy Greek food like I do I recommend stopping here. Gyro City is a good Greece restaurant. The place is clean and confortable. The decoration is nice. And the food is good. One of my best gyros was cooked there. So basically I recommended stop and take one of them. Close to the T. Quick order Greek restaurant with a varied menu.  Had the Chicken Gyro which was tasty.  Served with a small side of fresh hot French fries.  Hit the spot for lunch.  Service quick.  Outdoor seating was open and easy to access. Probably one of the best go to gyro places around mass. Good portions and flavors. Great for catering with the make your own gyros. Falafels are better elsewhere though like cafe landwer where they are less dry. the only item on the menu is coffee and you can put cream and sugar in it. the only sizes are medium and large. but its really good coffee, no line, and its worth it No place to sit,  long lines but friendly staff. Went here with my sister. I love the $2 special Nothing in here has natural ingredients. Best donuts! I was initially surprised and disappointed by the closure of the Original Tasty Burger near Fenway Park, but then I discovered that the restaurant had moved to a brand-new, shiny location on Van Ness Street, just a stone's throw from Fenway. The menu is exactly the same as when I last visited, even though the place looks brand new. The interior is very inviting and cozy. The burgers are still excellent. I had a cheeseburger with bacon, lettuce, and tomato, plus some onion strings on the side. It was a delicious meal, though I regret not getting the fries. The service was great, and my food came out super fast. I just love a good burger. I wanted just a great ballpark meal, and I got it! I got a hot dog with some onion rings, and my husband got a burger. Our server was cool and joked with us a bunch, and I had a great time! I joked that the burger looked so perfect, it looked like a crabby patty. We got there late night for dinner, we were a large  party, the burgers were tasty! We enjoyed our time and the food. The waiter was a little bit morose but overall nice place to have a tasty burger! Always accurate, fast and tasty. Open till late so great for late night cravings too. Never had a burger here I didn't like. Plus the customizations give you lots of options. It\u2019s okay, but it definitely tastes like typical frozen food. I tried both the beef and chicken burgers, but honestly, I\u2019d recommend exploring other places for a more satisfying meal. Casual, counter-serve kitchen that serves sushi rolls and ramen.\n\nStumbled upon this place while strolling around Fenway. During a busy Saturday lunch hour, the dining room was completely empty, so I initially didn\u2019t have high expectations. Along with some shumai, I got two of their specialty rolls. The shumai tasted like it came straight out of a microwave from a frozen packet, but it was still decent. Thankfully, the specialty sushi rolls were satisfying. Between the Blizzard and the Crazy Maki, my favorite was the Crazy Maki, which came with a surprisingly thick layer of sesame tuna tartare on top. Similarly, the Blizzard rolls came with a generous layer of crab stick, and a light drizzle of sriracha sauce added a nice flavor boost.\n\nSince they\u2019re also on Fooda, I got to try their poke for lunch as well. Despite its relatively high price, the Poke bowl was somewhat of a letdown in terms of both size and quality. With just seaweed salad, avocado, and tobiko, it lacked complexity and refinement, and it was one of the most basic poke I had in a while.\n\nOverall, a solid budget option for sushi rolls. While some of their offerings may be a miss, the quality and value of their specialty rolls make it a worthy contender. Stopped here for an early dinner while picking my brother up from Boston(4/9). This is the type of place I tend to enjoy. Casual spot, quick service and affordable food. Mostly students when we went.\n\nI had the chicken donburi while my brother had the poke and sushi. The chicken donburi was crispy and delicious. Lightly fried and not too greasy. Teriyaki sauce was sweet and not too overpowering. My brother enjoyed his poke and sushi as well but said the poke was just alright for the price. Nothing special.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a quick bite that won\u2019t break the bank, this is a good spot. Will have to try the sushi  burrito if I ever come back here. Update 2/28/2024:\nAfter a second visit, I'm upgrading to 5/5 stars.  On this visit I ordered one of their specialty rolls, the \"Rainbow Roll\" and the spicy tuna roll again.  Both were better than on my first visit, and I'm glad I went back.\n\nOriginal:\nI think this was a solid 4/5 stars experience.  It was better than just okay, but not like \"wow, I'm in love.\"  Admittedly, I've only started to appreciate sushi in the past couple of years, but I have a clue.\n\nI got the salmon roll and the spicy tuna roll, and I thought they were good but not great.  The salmon had a nice texture but a bit of a fishy taste.  The spicy tuna was better -- not very spicy though, which is fine for my Midwest palate.  I'm glad I got two rolls, because the rolls were pretty small.\n\nI thought this was good, but slightly less tasty than the pre-packed sushi rolls I get at the supermarket sushi counter -- and I'm not talking about Whole Foods here -- I'm talking about Meijer, our supermarket chain in Michigan.  The sushi rolls we make at home are way better.  I went there with a co-worker from California, and she thought it was pretty good, if that helps.\n\nStill...good, not great. Four stars. I got the mango sushi roll and it was fantastic, some of the best shrimp tempura and juiciest mango I have had! What a wonderful pairing, perfectly sized and very fresh shrimp! The tempura coating was light so the shrimp really shone through Nice, clean place with friendly, efficient servers. Food is alright - notably, shumai had that classic taste and the eel nigiri was flavorful and pretty. However, rolls can be a bit hit-or-miss; some pieces were way more rice and filler than fish, and the fish itself wasn\u2019t always particularly anything to rave about. But a good choice for a nicely priced sushi dinner. I dined here today & everything was amazing! All of the food was so fresh & danced on my taste buds! Gopi that works here was so very kind in letting me the different sauces that varied on spice level. This spot is about 5-10 minutes away from Fenway too! For ever having Indian food before, this definitely exceeded my expectations. I ordered the chicken bowl, tandoori chicken, samosas, & vada pav. If you find yourself in the Kenmore / Fenway area, totally give this place a shot! You won\u2019t be dissatisfied! I ordered Veg Keema Biryani and Chicken Biryani yesterday, and I\u2019m extremely disappointed. Both were drenched in ghee/oil to the point that it felt like I was buying oil, not biryani. The food was so greasy and unappetizing that I had to throw it away. Totally unacceptable and frustrating experience. Please work on improving the quality and balance of your dishes. Excellent Indian food!\n\nThe rice bowl is the main dish of the place. It\u2019s like Indian Chipotle.\n\nI come here very often and have found the quality of food to be consistently good over time.\n\nSome other good dishes are: Vada Pav, Loaded fries\n\nMake sure to add the Vindaloo sauce in your rice bowl. The Tikka Masala sauce as well.\n\nBuy the mango lassi because that\u2019s an exceptionally good drink.\n\nDecent service overall. If I have to think of 1 thing I don\u2019t like about Wow!! Tikka, it would be the distance. I\u2019m sad that this place is not right next door to me.\n\nTucked in a residential area near Fenway Park is this gem! I love how you can pick and choose your base, proteins, sauces, and toppings. It is quick, casual, and super yummy.\n\nThose meatballs are addictive but the entire meal itself is beyond fulfilling.\n\nDefinitely a must visit! The idea is cool, but the bowls here didnt have much flavor and everything tasted the same.  Their actual indian dishes are much better.  Quantity is good for the price.\n\nChipotle, cava, and other similar restaurants do a better job seasoning the individual parts of the bowl such as the rice, meat, and toppings.  Here, the rice was plain, the meat was plain and became a chore to eat, and the toppings were just like lettuce and tomatoes (nothing really seasoned or indian).\n\nThe other dishes here are better however. I would recommend people come here as long as they order from the street food menu section.\n\nStaff were nice and location is fine. Very welcoming and friendly gym. Tailored training for everyone from beginner to elite athlete. The coaches are great and walk you through every move with a focus on correct form. Parking is tough in this area so alternate transport might be a good idea. Fenway rocks. Jenna and Ben are super friendly and welcoming. Jenna is an incredible coach great feedback\nThanks Invictus I had a weightlifting/strength workout with Jenna and she was one of the best exercise teachers i\u2019ve ever had! Very friendly, receptive and accommodating to my abilities. Definitely would recommend her as a trainer, as well as this facility overall! I was visiting Boston for three weeks in July and got a 10-class pack to Invictus Fenway. It\u2019s an awesome CrossFit gym. The coaches and members are super nice. The classes were very small - usually 4 to 10 people, so lots of personalized coaching. There were athletes of many levels and I was able to modify the workouts to my abilities. There was always a long warm up and lots of instruction. The workouts were challenging and fun. I had a great time being a temporary member and Coach Ben made me feel so welcome saying \u201cHi, Suzi!\u201d every time I would walk in. The vibe is super friendly while also being serious about fitness. I would definitely come back here again. I dropped into a Saturday class. Best coach ever! Bern was so welcoming and kind. Everyone was awesome and had a great team workout. I drop in to CrossFit gyms when I\u2019m traveling and this was the best drop in experience I\u2019ve ever had. Highly recommend this gym! This is one of my favorite places to take a spin class.  Lizzie is my favorite instructor, but they\u2019re all great - I have not taken a  bad class at the Handlebar! The Fenway location is missing a lot of amenities the other locations have, but it is still a good experience! They unfortunately just switched their earplugs and hair ties that are not as comfortable. I noticed this switch at all locations.  If you don\u2019t book through the Handlebar itself, you are no longer able to pick the bike you\u2019re on! This is one of my least favorite parts about the Handlebar. I started going to the Handle Bar in Fenway in 2023, and have not stopped going back since. I take classes now at Fenway, North Station, North End, and South End locations and they all offer the same fantastic experience. The membership itself is such a great value to take advantage of all of the different class modalities they offer. But what really makes the Handle Bar special are its INCREDIBLE instructors and staff. They have given me a sense of community and belonging that is invaluable. I\u2019ve taken class with so many different instructors and loved each and every one. I could write a 5 paragraph essay on how much I love the  Handle Bar, cannot recommend enough!! I absolutely love this studio! It is super affordable, clean, and friendly. All of the instructors are amazing and make me leave feeling stronger and in a completely improved mood.\n\nThough I love the Harvard Square studio, the worst part about moving to Cambridge was missing Lizzie's T/TH 4:30 classes. She is one of my favorite instructors. She has the best attitude, the most energy, the best music, and I love that she's always trying new things in class. It really breaks up some of the monotony of structured classes. She is so kind, positive, and such a charismatic instructor! I love the Handle Bar in Fenway! Every class I\u2019ve taken is fire and I always look forward to the class themes! I tend to go to their 7 am classes, and can only speak about parking for that time of day, but have found it pretty easy to get a free spot within walking distance.\n\nThey have free shoe rentals, which is KEY if you don\u2019t cycle as often, and the front desk staff is always so friendly! I use ClassPass to book a bike and HB Fenway\u2019s customer has always been top notch whenever I\u2019ve had an issue or need to rebook. I highly recommend this location for anyone in the area looking for a darn good workout and especially if you have time to browse the area for a post workout coffee or treat! I love taking classes at the Handle Bar. I'm not a regular rider but I always feel welcome and I leave every class feeling empowered and energized. The teachers put so much of themselves into every class, and I'm so thankful because I get so much more than just a good workout from each class."

    "reviews": "This CVS is perfectly serviceable. I bought a very large bag of candy and it was not expensive. Clean and staff seemed kind and well trained.\n\nI could not find a place for small toys though. Easy in and out Cvs at a convenient location good .. helpful staff They have very cool instruments and it's a great space. I'm not sure about how I felt on my first day of guitar lessons. I'll see as time goes on.\nAlso, I've taken my Deans guitar here to be checked. I  came back and got it because I decided I wasn't mentally prepared to spend much on fixing it, however, one of the staff had already fixed part of the issue and they didn't charge me for it. It's amazing. Glenno is an absolute gem of a human being and was fantastically helpful in helping me find a new guitar. Give that man a raise! Hands down the best experience I\u2019ve had picking out a guitar. Gave me the time I needed to try a bunch of options and was there to answer questions when needed (he is a wealth of knowledge too). Great store selection and the rest of the staff is super friendly too! A salesman by the name Aiden sold me an amp, and I really appreciated how knowledgeable and patient he was with my bouncing around trying to find the right rig. This guy knows his stuff and is passionate about it. I definitely will be spending a lot more money here. Off street parking too. Surprised how good an experience I had considering it's a chain.  I ordered a 3/4 size guitar from another store pulled it out to check it had a bad pickup.  Manager immediately had tech look at it . Wasn't a simple fix so offered return.  Then manager and clerk brought me a bunch of other 3/4 size guitars.   Manager offered to have tech do a quick fix on minor issue on one guitar I was trying.  And these are cheap guitars so very nice of them to offer that.  They let me play a few until I found the one that spoke to me and I bought that.  How it should be. Great experience today. I brought in equipment to sell and even though the transaction didn't end up working out, the staff were all friendly, attentive and honest. It was clear they genuinely wanted to help. Good feelings all around. We are from Europe and we absolutely love the brand and the customer service at Baseballism. Sean did everything he could today to make my shopping experience perfect. Love the products, the quality and the staff of Baseballism Boston. Will more then likely come back! Jeremy was extremely friendly and very helpful!! The store is neat, orderly and full of awesome gear for any baseball fan. The 6-4-3/2 tank is my favorite. Had a great time in the store! The staff was friendly and answered all questions I had regarding the different merchandise. As someone who doesn't know too much about baseball, it was nice learning about what the different clothing meant. Came out of the store with a lovely \"Beantown\" shirt after I was done browsing. So great to have these folks in the neighborhood! Everyone in the store always has a smile on their face! From giveaways to other fantastic promotions, there's always a reason to check back in at Baseballism whenever you're near Fenway Park. Great customer service ! Went in there before a Red Sox game and walked out with pregame souvenirs ! Concept is great , staff is great, Katy is very knowledgeable about her products along with Jeremy\u2019s passion for the games ! I recommend to everyone around the area , before or after the game ! The Sausage Guy hands down has the best sausages in all of the New England Area. What's been amazing is their local growth over the years. They've been able to expand from your local vendor cart outside of Fenway Park to now being inside Polar Park, the XL Center, and even being featured at the 99s restaurant. They even sell their sausages at some of the local supermarkets.\n\nI've had The Sausage Guy cater my holiday party the last 4 years and each time has been a Grand Slam. Everything came cooked, prepared, and piping hot like it was just off the grill. The quality and taste matches the same one you would get like you were right outside of Fenway Park.\n\nIf you are looking at any gatherings, no matter the time of year, I highly suggest reaching out to The Sausage Guy to have them cater your next event! You will impress all your guests for sure. Bought the sausages at Hannafords and they are not good Italian sausages.Low favor .I am from Boston and lived 40 years moved away in 90 \u2018s and the sausages were way better than this guy and different all together . Sorry this is low on favor terrible sausage.Had Grillo pickles with them they are the best. Threw these sausages out and had Fenway Franks .Now they never disappoint and are the real deal . This is a sausage guy but from the sausage guy .Peace The aroma from this cart is remarkable! Smelled so good we had to get something! The sausage was incredible and the veggies add good flavor too and the bun was super soft and enjoyable! The guy was friendly and they were working hard! I\u2019ll be back! Great sausage to grab after a Sox game for the walk home. The roll was soft and fresh, the peppers and onions were perfectly cooked. The sausage is juicy, and spiced right, cooked perfectly. My fianc\u00e9 and I stop here after every Sox game and split a sausage loaded with peppers and onions. They take cash and card. The employees are always friendly to us and ask us how we are doing. Great stand! Bought a package of the sweet sausages in Ayer Mass.  The best!  Tastes like my Sicilian grandmother's homemade sausage, which I haven't had in years.  Wish I could get these in Southern Indiana. A great restaurant inside the ballpark and only accessible by ticket holders. They provide a great ambiance and area to enjoy dinner before or during the beginning of the game. You can't take the food out to your seats, so just give yourself enough time to enjoy. The chef and service team are amazing and we're able to cook to my friend's dietary restrictions. They have a fun little ice cream bar that you can get a scoop and toppings in a mini baseball hat. It's a bit pricey, but the quality is good and it's a great addition to the experience of great seats and a Red Sox game. I had never been to honeygrow before today but I decided to try it on a whim. I made my own stir fry and really enjoyed it. Plus it didn\u2019t feel too heavy which was nice. I\u2019d definitely come back! I had never been here before, and as a person with a gluten allergy I was a bit nervous about ordering. Someone noticed I was taking my time, and the actual manager came out to help me order. She double checked all the allergen info and instructed the crew to follow allergy-safe protocol. I ended up doing a \u201cbuild your own\u201d stir fry, and it was bomb. Thank you Madeline and crew for serving up a delicious gluten free meal! Great stir fry, the make your own with the spicy garlic was fire!  I wish they had a location in Texas.  The fruit cups are delicious too. I would definitely go back. Packed with flavor. The build your own bowl is excellent with lots of options! Normally I'm intimidated by the custom \"custom\" menu items, and just default to a usual, but not here. You order off a tablet but it's relatively straightforward, and vegan/allergen options are clearly marked. Great menu, quick efficient ordering and food prep. Amazing Buffalo chicken salad bowl. What an awesome place for a meal and some drinks before a Red Sox game. We ended up here at the end of our Fenway Park tour. This place also has a museum inside. It appears that you need some sort of club pass to enter. In any event, Royal Rooters Club is a very neat establishment to frequent before a game! Cool bar inside of Fenway. Great semi private spot, with AC so great for those with young kids.\n\nSmall menu, but typical bar food. Very clean! Great atmosphere! Quick service! The drinks were on point, and the food was delicious.  I only had a few items off the menu.  However, the memorabilia was amazing, and the service was excellent Had the chance to get some passes here for a game and it was delightful. Food big step up from in the park, which makes sense, and the memorabilia on display is really interesting and fun stuff. Has a great experience at the Club before a Red Sox game with a friend. It's a great place to get away from the crowds and have a quiet dinner.\n\nWe sat at the bar to be closer to the TV for the start of the game and the bartenders were great and helpful.\n\nI ordered a Royal Rooter burger which was cooked exactly the way I wanted it and was seasoned perfectly. The wings and pizza were amazing! And Alex was very sweet as well as an excellent mixologist! I had the honey habenero wings, which are fall of the bone delicious. The atmosphere is lively on game day. Great service and great food, but be aware, the nachos are super, super cheesy. Almost too cheesy... something I never thought I would ever say in my lifetime. It was nice to be able to stop in someplace so close to Fenway Park!  Their menu is on the smaller side, but for what they do offer the quality and portions are good!  They offer seating both outdoors and indoors, outdoor seating is a bit less crowded and noisy, all in all a good place to grab a bite before the game! Awesome! A friend and I stopped in before the Red Sox game and decided on the nachos. They were the best nachos we've ever eaten! They come on a baking sheet and they were so cheesy and delicious. Every nacho had something on it. The portion was generous, we couldn't eat them all even though we almost made ourselves sick trying. I've been craving them everyday since! Thank you Max & Leo's for the memories. We will meet again! This was the first time I had visited a build-your-own-pizza joint. It was fantastic; lots of options and the pizza was quite large for what you pay. This is a fun place to go if you're out in the city with friends. However, the wait times tend to be long, so this is not the place to go if you're in a hurry. Blaze Pizza is a chain of pizza restaurants that had multiple locations across Massachusetts. The interior is quite large and clean, and overall the pizza is great.\n\nThe staff were pretty helpful and friendly, accommodating most requests for the pizza, which is helpful when you build your own.\n\nThe appeal of blaze pizza is their pre-made or build your own options, which we've never had an issue with. The pizza is a thinner crust, but that tastes good with the topping options. Pizza is also a bit on the expensive side, but overall the portions and toppings provided are pretty good quality for the price. We've tried multiple combos and pre-made pizzas, and they've never disappointed.\n\nOverall, a solid place to try in the area. Because this is the second time I\u2019ve had this type of experience with this location\u2026I\u2019m writing this review.\n\nPlease do NOT order online from here. I\u2019ve had no luck with accuracy of orders. The first time, the toppings were incorrect. As of writing this review, my ENTIRE order was incorrect. The drink was wrong (diet coke instead of coke zero) \u2014 this wasn\u2019t bad, and is understandable.\n\nBUT, my pizza actually didn\u2019t even have sauce. It was just cheese and pepperoni, and it was missing the condiment. Seriously though, how do you forget sauce on a pizza?It\u2019s even specified in the order. Granted, it\u2019s almost 2 hours until closing, and the work staff might be tired (as someone who used to work in the food industry, I get it), but this location has some serious quality control standards. I\u2019ve attached images, as well.\n\nNOT an experience you want to have when getting home from work late. This location is really clean and the workers are a vibe. Food always come fresh and tasty! I love being a regular here. Pizzas are baked well and toppings are super fresh. Love that the heat can be turned up or down based on the sauce you choose - I like mine painfully spicy! I always get the *Build Your Own* because it has the best price point. Currently Google Maps directions doesn't show this path, but if you keep walking north from here you can keep walking across the bridge to Commonwealth Ave. Which is a great shortcut, but the intersection itself is a bit scary with all the cars and the traffic light arrangement. Not much else to do here Beatifull city I have been to CorePower classes in 6 states, and these Boston Fenway classes are by far the worst. Firstly, I think the crackling, tinny, too-loud microphone should be avoided. Encourage your instructors to project and speak up without a headset. The headset is awful and cheapens the experience. I have been to larger studios that don\u2019t need them. Secondly, the clientele at Boston Fenway are not very conscientious that it is a yoga class. They talk and use phones in the room. The instructors should encourage better yoga decorum and ask for phones off (no scrolling TikTok on your mat until class starts) and respect of the space. There is no sense of community here. People joke that CorePower is corporate yoga, but I never feel that more than at this studio. This is a terribly run establishment. Today, I showed up for a 3:15pm class and was told on my early arrival that the class was canceled due to \u201cit\u2019s winter so we have been canceling classes.\u201d Myself and other attendees received no notification of this prior to my arrival.\n\nI had previously shown up to CorePower Fenway exacrly on time for a class and was not let in due to \u201csafety.\u201d I was later told by a friend who attended the class that it was full, meaning they just sold my slot and didn\u2019t refund me.\n\nThe one class I attended the instructor was good but not worth dealing with this logistically-poor establishment that does not account for attendee\u2019s time nor money. I absolutely love this location! This was the first place I went to when starting my membership and I wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way. All the instructors genuinely enjoy practicing yoga and ofc teaching it. All the technique and form that was taught there carries such a long way. Sadly, I moved away from this location and have to go to another location. This new location does not even compare to the Fenway location. The difference is insane - this new location doesn\u2019t teach the way Fenway instructors do. I see all the other reviews here and it seems like most people had trouble with showing up late.. just show up on time and you\u2019ll be fine I promise I booked the 1:30 pm sculpt class today. Was at the door at 1:31 to which I saw the instructor, Jamie Khanschassoff, tell her associate to not let me in. Core power preached kindness towards their yogis yet I was treated with mean spirited behavior and not allowed to go into class. After being 1 minute late and her seeing me run to the door. Every other studio I've been to has given their clients grace if they arrive a minute late and the decency to speak with them rather than shake their head no and tell their colleague to not let a client in. Extremely disappointing 2 stars because the teachers are great but I chose this studio specifically because they have a shower and it\u2019s halfway to my morning work commute but I went to used the shower today and saw mold caked on the the shower liner and in the shower. This is disgusting and it\u2019s a health hazard. The shower curtain was stuck together, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. If you\u2019re gonna offer these facilities, whether they are used often or not, they need to be cleaned well. I won\u2019t be coming back here. You can sit at the garage door and watch the game from the outfield, basically.  No tickets are required,  but get here early and get a good table. Great atmosphere in here and an odd thing you might not know is you get to stare at the bar when standing at the urinal in the mens room!! They can see your face through the window as well.... Good time to smile \ud83d\ude03 The video is not the view. It's literally at field level, below where the sign reads, Red Sox Win, the garage door. We did a tour of the game Fenway Park, then went to the Bleacher Bar to have a meal.\nGreat atmosphere, people and food. Went in the offseason, visiting from Florida. It was on my bucket list and even though the ballpark was quiet, the bar had a good mix of music and the food was delish. Our server also made sure our drinks were never empty. I imagine this place gets packed in the summer, I still rate it a must see for baseball fans all around. We were recommended to come here so we did while in town. We were turned away at the door somewhat rudely, apparently they had an event for a couple hours and were told to come back at 10. Still not open, so had to come back at 10:30. Wanted to eat dinner here so couldn\u2019t so came to check it out and have a drink. Wasn\u2019t too busy since they just \u201copened\u201d to the public. Service wasn\u2019t the best and kitchen was closed and it wasn\u2019t the cleanest inside. Finished our drink and left. We came and saw and didn\u2019t feel much more was left to experience here. Went here after doing a tour of Fenway. The vibes are spot on and the food was incredible. Great fries and probably the best hot dog I've ever had. I found this place on google and didn't know if it would be good.  First off the prices are great! For Boston.  They are unheard of!  Second off the atmosphere is so comfy and welcoming and nice and clean and the aesthetic you would expect from country bar and food establishment.   The food is also amazing.  I had the Nashville eggs Benedict.  I'm still thinking about his dish three days later.   My husband had Smashburger, which was equally amazing.      The singing live music topped this place off. I will always return if I'm in Boston and hopefully soon!  I also had the jelly donut drink.  Nice and strong and just what you need in the morning with live music and good brunch.   Nice work this place is bomb. Came in on a Friday night before a concert across the street at MGM and had a great experience. Food & service were great, no complaints from anyone. The cornbread will haunt my dreams\u2026. Soooo good It\u2019s a fun atmosphere. If you could see from the photo of the stages integrated into the restaurant. Servers were friendly. The cornbread was good, sweet and dense. The fried green tomatoes were ok, the greens were a bit tough(flavor ok), the mac was a bit flavorless, and brisket was dry and fatty.\nGo for the beer and the music. Great location, friendly staff. Outdoor patio great for people watching on nice days.\nFood was pretty bland and uninteresting. Expensive due to proximity to Fenway Park.\nA good place to hang out before/after ballgames, but not somewhere I'd go explicitly for the food. Fried chicken & waffle was amazing, the best I've had in years. Spicy, sweet, salty and fat. Loved it. Also, it was just 12$. Fabulous match day atmosphere pre & post game. Right next to Fenway Park.\nBrilliant chicken wings of all flavours. Excellent service and food.\nAnd of course, full sports bar tv experience! Highly recommended Good place for American food and also served good drinks. The coconut margarita was really good. Had the Mac and Cheese as well and was pretty tasty. The onion rings were some of the best I\u2019ve had. This place was amazing. The food was presented nicely, the food was delicious, and food came very quickly no longer than 20 minutes.  I came here during a game day in Boston and it was packed, soo many people, they were standing around yelling at the bar and surrounding area.  I had to yell at the waiter just for him to hear my order. \ud83e\udd23  But other than that I will be coming again for the food and on a non game day. The staff were friendly. My husband and I made mention that we were from out of town to the bartender (think his name was Aaron) and every time my husband got up, Aaron made sure to come back and check on me a little more frequently. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was what I would expect being right across from Fenway. Will definitely go back if we ever make it to another Red Sox game. I got the brisket. The flavor was good, but not cooked well, I had to use a knife to cut it. Fries taisted good, but were a little cold. The corn bread was just ok. I am picky on coke slaw and yhat was not my style. Service was very slow and the place was not busy. We rarely saw our waiter. The place was fairly clean. Lots of TVs all over. The staff was very short in conversation and were cordial, but not super friendly. This place looks really cool inside, but that\u2019s where the positives end. Service isn\u2019t just bad, it\u2019s nonexistent. Not once did the server ever come by without being summoned. Bibimbop bowl was basically a huge bowl of rice with the thinnest layer of toppings. It looked good, but was a total joke. Still starving after that, I ordered steamed vegetable dumplings, which couldn\u2019t have been blander. And as a pescatarian, I struggled to find anything decent on the menu. Zero chance I would ever go back. This was legitimately the worst chicken fried rice I've ever had. The difference between the picture on the menu and what I got was like the difference between a frozen TV dinner box and what it looks like finished. It was horrible in every way, the only redeeming quality was that it wasn't raw, I guess. When you're paying $20 for some of the cheapest ingredients in the world, you expect it to be actually good. This fried rice honestly just left me depressed with how bland and unappetizing it was. Tasted like there was no seasoning at all, not even salt. The rice looked like maybe it got a 30 second stir fry. The chicken was dry, chewy and bland. No flavor at all in this dish. I would have rather gone hungry than waste $20 on this food unfit for human consumption. That's basically what I did anyway, I took maybe 5 bites and threw it away. Friendly staff here. Great portions for the size. Loved going here with friends or myself. It is very close to Fenway station. Lychee soju is delicious !\n\nmy favorite is the  Tteok-bokki. Been here for multiple birthdays, it\u2019s been great! The aloe soju and Yakult soju pitchers are so good, tastes literally like juice! The Korean food is okay, it\u2019s not the most amazing, definitely worse than if you\u2019d just go to a Korean restaurant. The tteokbokki isn\u2019t as soft as I\u2019d like, the ramen is simply Shin ramen (but for 10x the price lol), the wings are good but they\u2019re really sticky and not as meaty as I\u2019d like. The food is still good, but if you\u2019re coming here for food, you\u2019d be disappointed. The service is really good! The waiters are very nice and are quick with service. The atmosphere is great, love the music they play. Except oftentimes the music cuts out and randomly changes to a different song. Kills the vibe a little, wish there was a DJ (which they do have a booth for a DJ but each time I\u2019ve been there\u2019s been no one there). I tried getting up and dancing one time but unfortunately the waiters said that if we all left our table to dance, they would need to bill our table and clean it up. I get that it\u2019s not a club, but that was kind of sad :( Overall though, it\u2019s a pretty good place for you to hang with friends and celebrate. Haven\u2019t been here since they relocated and wow! The place is huge now so many wide screen TVs with sports games and music videos all around the restaurant. To be honest the volume was a little too loud for us and the strobe lights made the ambiance a little chaotic.\n\nThe service was good and so was the food!\n\nWe ordered some classic favorites:\nCORN CHEESE\nCorn comes out on a sizzling skillet and it is stunning! The cheese on the corn has cheese pulls for days and every bite just melts in your mouth. If you love cheese, this is the dish for you!\n\nKOREAN BBQ BEEF BULGOGI\nThinly sliced marinated beef that comes out on a sizzling skillet, so tasty! Well seasoned and flavored, this was gobbled up within minutes!\n\nDDOK-BOKGHI (TTEOK-BOKKI)\nKorean street food served with rice cake, fishcake, and vegetables. Tossed in Gochujang-based sauce (sweet & spicy sauce). The rice cake was nice and chewy, but the sauce was a little disappointing. There wasn\u2019t any spice or any flavoring really, it just tasted overwhelmingly sweet without any spice. Wouldn\u2019t get again.\n\nSPICY KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN WINGS\nThese wings were a little small, but boy was the crunch and juicy, tender meat on point! The flavors and heat were exactly what we wanted the heat was a good top tier medium, where we could enjoy more and still taste everything. Absolutely loved these!\n\nSOY GARLIC KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN WINGS\nAgain, the wings were a little small, but the crunch, juicy meat, and delicious flavors came together with each and every bite. Sooo finger licking good! This was great to have in between the spicy wings. So tasty!\n\nDefinitely give this place a try for some tasty food! Had a great time at Bill's Bar & Lounge! The comedy shows on Friday and Saturday nights are a blast. Plus, the staff is friendly, and the drinks and food are good. Definitely worth checking out. Entrance staff wouldn\u2019t refund money within literally 20 seconds of taking our cash ($60 total) even though our entire group didn\u2019t ever walk past the door entrance register, and we were communicating with the front entry staff the whole time.\n\nWe had a designated driver in their late 40s with an \u201cX\u201d marked on both hands that showed this to the staff, plus offered to provide an image of his license but they still turned him down from any entry (even without having the option to only order water but no alcohol) and wouldn\u2019t give the group money back when we said we would have to find another place.\n\nI\u2019ve never posted a bad review for any other business before and typically my other reviews are positive because I believe in praising great service far more than criticizing others, but this experience at Bill\u2019s was beyond poor and demonstrates highly unethical business practice. This bar let half of our group in and the other half out of the bar. Due to their rules they close at 1 but they let 3 people in at 1:08 and CHARGED them and said no to all of us despite being of age at 1:09. We asked for a refund and they called us racist insults and told us to leave even though we come here every weekend. Would never recommend! Bills Bar is a place that\u2019s been around forever but with the right managers and recent renovations they\u2019ve got the place trendy, really eye catching and fun. There\u2019s always a cool DJ turning up the crowd before and after the Red Sox games and the bartenders have great hospitality and are fast. Check out the fish and chips with a friend it\u2019s a huge shareable plate. Called my friends and i very racist slurs and then proceeded to kick us out after letting 2 white girls in our friend group in at 1:07. If you\u2019re closed stay closed but do not recommend due to bills employees racist statements! I am a Central MA-based wedding planner, and with my company, Core Events Co. I worked with a fabulous couple to host their wedding at the Foundation Room Boston. To say we were completely and totally blown away by the service we received there is a vast understatement. My client's original venue was a horror show of terrible service and awful communication, so we decided just a few months out to switch gears and find a new venue. The House of Blues kind of fell into our laps since my clients are both amazing musicians and love the overall moody vibe and atmosphere of HOB. We worked with the event staff, Madi & Meaghan, who were both so caring, attentive, and intuitive to all of our wants and needs for the event throughout the entire process. There was never a question left unanswered, and it truly felt like we were one united team working together to pull off an incredible night for our clients. I will add that this was not your traditional wedding, as my clients got legally married during COVID and wanted to have an epic celebration with their friends and family, who flew in from all over the US & Canada. Planning something like this in under 4 months normally would be a trick to pull off, but with the help of the HOB staff, it was an easy and enjoyable process from start to finish. The day of the event went so flawlessly thanks to the entire HOB staff. The event was 3 months ago and we are all STILL reminiscing about the delicious food, atmosphere, and the fun we all had planning and executing the wedding. I cannot recommend this venue enough. If you're looking for a unique, fun, and unforgettable venue in Boston, your search ends here. It was truly an experience I will always remember! Thank you HOB TEAM! If you're willing to buy a ticket to a show, you mine as well get the Foundation room if it's available. It is expensive to become a member but sometimes you can add it on for $20-$30. I find myself wanting to spend as much time in the Foundation Room as I do the venue floor while there.\nThe decor is phenomenal, psychedelic, and the pictures are just a fraction of the splendor. Theres plenty of space to settle in with a large or small group here, and there's even a deck! There's TVs throughout the rooms with stage on display.\nAlso separate bathrooms and bar from the main show. (drinks are cheaper downstairs though) Love the bar/nightclub before and after concerts. The menu is pretty good and the dj\u2019s in between are pretty cool. Love the classy, upscale vibes while at the bar. Being able to grab a drink 10x faster than folks inside of the venue during concerts is an incredible perk. One of the best parts about going to House of Blues in Boston is enjoying the foundation room. Great intimate space for a concert. Just a few couches and bar tables, otherwise standing room only. Bar has limited selections.  Cozy and beautifully creative space. I went with my girlfriend to dinner before a show. We ordered different drinks but neither drink had any alcohol. My drink cost $15. It was supposed to be a rum and coke but there was no rum. My girlfriend had a cocktail with gin. I strongly dislike the taste of gin but when I tasted her drink I could not taste any gin. Then we ordered food. My girlfriend ordered the cajun pasta . It tasted good but barely had any chicken or sausage. I ordered a burger. I requested it be cooked medium. It was barely cooked so I had to send it back. It took several minutes for me to get our waitress' attention. My girlfriend finished her meal before my second burger arrived. This burger was cooked medium rare. It was still undercooked but I ate it anyway because the show was starting soon.  The undercooked burger tasted fine. Wonderful, friendly and professional service here at the garage. Great location. If you can get a space, it's very convenient. Good price to park here compared to what you get. Great spot for a parking garage and easy to park and pay! If you need to park here I\u2019d plan on this place! I\u2019m sure during the games it packs quickly WE GOT SCAMMED HERE. DO NOT PARK HERE!!!\nWe Parked here for the day for a concert at house of blues. The gentlemen working said $40 for the day. (Parked at 12:00 for a 8:00 concert, which they said was fine). We come back at 6:00 to drop our coats off and the man there threatened to tow us and said we parked illegally.  Said we were not given a valid ticket (even though the gentleman working earlier gave us a ticket for our car). Said they closed before the concert ended which we were were told differently before we parked.\nAt the end of the day these guys are a total scam DO NOT given them your business. They will try to scam you!!!!! Absolutely horrible!  We told them we wanted to park until mid night and they gave us a ticket.   We went back to drop off our jackets before the concert we were attending and the guys said he was going to have us towed because our parking was \u201c in valid\u201d. Even though we paid $40 already at noon.   Do NOT park here!!! It is a scam! Inexpensive and convenient for a show at House of Blues. Im sure its more costly when there is a game.\n\nPorta potty on site was clutch."

    "reviews": "When you first enter, this seems like a smaller CVS until you realize there's a second floor. Overall good service but the store does feel a bit messy. I still don't know why they lock up some of their items. Just get better security instead of making the honest people wait around for someone to unlock the shaving cream. I was very sad today to witness a black male being racially profiled by the cashier managing the self check out section, at around 2 pm today. He asked her if they had soap containers, she told him to pay 1st & then she would help him find the soap container, she then accused him of attempting to steal when everyone there could clearly see that he wanted to buy the soap container & everything else he planned to purchase all at once.\n\nWhen the individual walked in the store, he was followed. I could hear the cashier telling the guy, \"I know what you are trying to do\". The guy replied, \" I have no idea what you are talking about\". In the end, he paid for all his items & politely thanked her even though she was extremely rude to him. I've seen this employee smoking cigarettes by the front entrance on multiple occasions so I recognized her. She is a brunette, looks like she is in her 50's, or 60's. This was very sad to watch, I really hope this review will prevent this from happening to other customers in the future. I wish there was a way to give 0 stars. Great CVS! The store itself was standard, but the staff was nice, especially Rita. Welcoming experience and I was able to get what I needed quickly! TERRIBLE customer service upstairs. We went to get passport photos done. There was 2 employees and no customers and despite us asking for help both continued doing what they were doing. Once someone finally stopped to assist us, she couldn\u2019t even tell us the pricing. We walked back out. What a great pharmacy.  I needed a prescription filled pronto and the urgent care was next door.  They were able to process my prescription within 20 minutes and Rubi was super nice Too overpriced, and some products dont even have a price tag. Tell me why they charged me $16 for one pack of Sa Yang Buldak ramen that I can easy buy at Star Market for only $8.99. Also they charge $1 dollar for one plastic bag. Also, it seems they dont follow the prices on the only items that have a price tag on them. Watch out for the prices when they are scanning the items Local Gem . Open 24 hours even on holidays . Has a very large selection of snacks , candy , common household items, and a whole bunch of international items . Super convenient corner shop can\u2019t go wrong Found a gem in the confusion of an area that's new to me. Visiting from Maine while my bf gets treatment at Dana Farber. Got into town really late & needed food. Thankfully this place was open & not too far from our hotel. The guys that work there were super friendly and funny. The place has a great selection of groceries, cleaning products, snacks, and just all sorts of things you may need or didn't know you needed. Of course the prices are high but everything is these days. Besides you're paying for convenience. The price of fuel is driving the cost of goods and services way up so that along with the high rent of the area you're going to pay more. Definitely stop in to support this local gem! I would give five stars for their wide selection and friendly staff, but everything here is so overpriced. It seems like they just add $2 onto every item. The bananas they sell at the cashier are probably the biggest rip off, you could easily go to Whole Foods down the street and save money. You know it's overpriced when Whole Foods is the cheaper option. After all, it is a convenience store but if you're on a budget I would avoid this place. Really excellent experience using this shop for Bounce Luggage Storage. I would definitely use this location again and recommend to a friend. I\u2019ve never used Bounce before and I wanted an option for a place to leave my bags after landing in Boston and exploring the city before my friends got in. Employees were very friendly. My bags were untouched and in the same place when I returned for pick up. Thank you  Symphony Market! They have very cool instruments and it's a great space. I'm not sure about how I felt on my first day of guitar lessons. I'll see as time goes on.\nAlso, I've taken my Deans guitar here to be checked. I  came back and got it because I decided I wasn't mentally prepared to spend much on fixing it, however, one of the staff had already fixed part of the issue and they didn't charge me for it. It's amazing. Glenno is an absolute gem of a human being and was fantastically helpful in helping me find a new guitar. Give that man a raise! Hands down the best experience I\u2019ve had picking out a guitar. Gave me the time I needed to try a bunch of options and was there to answer questions when needed (he is a wealth of knowledge too). Great store selection and the rest of the staff is super friendly too! A salesman by the name Aiden sold me an amp, and I really appreciated how knowledgeable and patient he was with my bouncing around trying to find the right rig. This guy knows his stuff and is passionate about it. I definitely will be spending a lot more money here. Off street parking too. Surprised how good an experience I had considering it's a chain.  I ordered a 3/4 size guitar from another store pulled it out to check it had a bad pickup.  Manager immediately had tech look at it . Wasn't a simple fix so offered return.  Then manager and clerk brought me a bunch of other 3/4 size guitars.   Manager offered to have tech do a quick fix on minor issue on one guitar I was trying.  And these are cheap guitars so very nice of them to offer that.  They let me play a few until I found the one that spoke to me and I bought that.  How it should be. Great experience today. I brought in equipment to sell and even though the transaction didn't end up working out, the staff were all friendly, attentive and honest. It was clear they genuinely wanted to help. Good feelings all around. It truly felt that Rocky Mountain Garage Door saved the day! Their staff was quite knowledgeable and very helpful in choosing just the right garage door for our new home. The installation was done efficiently and flawlessly. Strongly recommend them for a top level of service and quality products. DO NOT RECOMMEND! Absolutely horrible experience. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. My garage broke first week of Sept. Someone came immediately and quoted me 3-4 weeks. Took my deposit of over $2500. After they took my money all communications halted. I had to follow up several times before getting an update that timeline is extended to 6-8 weeks. My instal was set to happen today. This morning they confirmed 11-1 instal time. When I followed up at 130pm because no one showed up, they told me 'the technician got stuck it will be delay' and they were refunding my deposit because they cannot deal with it.\n\nDO NOT CALL THESE PEOPLE. COMPLETE SCAMMERS!! Rocky Mountain Garage Door definitely came through for us last week, when the spring broke in our garage and my car was stuck in there.  The previous company we used, 'Overhead Garage Service,' 3 months ago, replaced the motor, and said the springs were OK. My first call was to them on Monday, and I did not receive priority service.  The customer service person did not call back, I made 2 calls and was told that there was no one in my area that day, but she would call on Tuesday, and try to get someone out.  I felt my problem was not a priority at all. Fast forward, I decided to try Rocky Mountain Garage Door and was not disappointed.   David came out the same day I called and replaced the springs.  Job well done.  I appreciate good customer service so much, as it is becoming rarer in this city. When our garage door opener quit working I did a Google search and found all these great reviews for Rocky Mountain Garage Door. Called them up and they said they would be out the very next day. Not only were they on time, they called me about an hour before the scheduled appointment time to ask if they could come over early, which worked out great for me. They were both very friendly and were done installing the new opener in only about 45 minutes. I highly recommend them. Jacob is the absolute best! I ordered a new garage motor from Amazon and called Rocky Mountain Garage Door to install. Turned out the new motor was missing two essential pieces that could not be supplied individually. Jacob was so patient and understanding and came back the following week to install the motor after we received a replacement. He explained everything thoroughly and did a PERFECT job! Could not recommend Rocky Mountain Garage Door more! Visited for quick shopping. It's similar to other wholefood but probably smaller and less choices due to being the city version but not 100% sure. Absolutely love this location. They are always fully stocked on shelves and if not they are more than willing to go out back to search for what you need.\nTheir hot food bars are a hit or miss only because of all the students from the colleges near by as well as employees of all the businesses around the area. They do their best to keep it fully stocked. They definitely do an amazing job of maintaining the cleanliness around the foods considering the high volume of traffic they have at any given tjme.\nIf you're looking to get in and out I suggest avoiding this location between 430 &630p as this seems to be their busiest times Easy to find what\u2019s needed in well stocked store. Self checked out quickly with no lines. Like that it\u2019s so close to where I\u2019m staying. Will be back next time. Great place for food and beverage. Nice people, good prices. There's an Amazon pickup place in there too. Finally a place I can buy bulletproof coffee during the weekend! :) I just recently found out that Whole Foods offers bulletproof coffee in addition to the cold brew packed version. Nice Whole Foods store and friendly staff. I really love this place especially for plants! They are super close to a plant store and sells very nice house plants for $9.99 if not discounted at the time. I went and got a pretty plant and  Philipp helped and was super nice and understanding I'm not  a big hardware store guy, but this location has everything from plumbing, electrical and kitchen essentials. Little on the high end , but I know there rent must be sky high. They bailed me out again .thank you I don\u2019t know why this is rated so poorly, one of the only decent hardware stores in the city Tried to copy my keys, went there twice. Both time failed, the keys don\u2019t work. Plus the staff are very rude. The third time I tried to get my refund for the keys, the cashier ( short hair female ) was super rude and asked me for my receipt in an extremely rude way. The guy who did my keys stood right there didn\u2019t say that he did the key for me.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ll never go back there again. My shower rod broke unexpectedly and I needed a new one to be able to bathe. I ran over to the store to try and get there before closing but the guy at the door refused to let me in, even after I tried explaining my situation. The guy just said, \"nah, were closed\" and shut the door in my face. I get it, hours are hours and they got lives to lead but I've done my time with retail jobs and helped people out when they needed it. Super disappointed with this experience since they're usually super helpful. This is unreal! USPS is open till 12 a.m. and open on Sunday. And plenty of parking spots in the center of downtown Boston. I first read the review on Google, and they said this USPS really opens till midnight and you won\u2019t have any issues finding a parking spot. I was not sure and could not believe it at first, but it is real! The staff is also friendlier than at other USPS locations. 5/5! A worker was very rude and belittling to a customer who was just trying to buy stamps, the customer had given this worker the money for the stamps and the lady took the money without giving the lady stamps. when the lady asked for her money back the lady kept saying no. she kept calling the woman stupid and telling her to couldn\u2019t do math, and it was very offensive to talk to a woman who\u2019s first language is obviously not english all this. she made the woman cry and the manager gave the lady her 100 dollars back, leaving the poor old lady crying. The worker was unremorseful and went with no warning for yelling at the woman then refusing her service. A tracking number letter. Had a letter get to this location for Boston Delivery.2/17\nWas fowarded to Raintree Ma, 2/17\nTo Weston Ma, 2/18\nTo Middle Essex/Essex 2/19\nBACK to Boston. 2/20,\nTHEN:\nTo Nashua N.H. 2/21\nCALLED THE BOSTON  OFFICE, Their response?\n\"We dont know where it is??? Although its Been to Boston twice?\nAvoid this location. They don\u2019t address any issues and seem completely unqualified, including the branch manager. Their only concern is to get rid of you as quickly as possible. I recommend using other postal service providers. Great location right off Summer St.\nAlong the harbor\n\nEasy to walk to /find with great signage.\n\nCute spring decor up to welcome guests and patrons at the entrance/exit\n\nThe worker/cashier at the desk was a bit sassy with me when responding to my question (maybe she was having a bad day?) but other than that it was a nice location. Although I was vague about what I wanted, Fiona did an incredible job and gave me exactly what I was looking for. She was calm, patient, and a pleasure to talk to. It was definitely one of the best hair experiences I've had in a long time. I highly recommend her! I come here once a month to touch up my roots and am very happy with my hairstylist. However, for some reason, they stopped purchasing the color remover for the skin! As a result, I have to leave the salon with stains on my forehead, ears, and neck, which take several days and multiple washes to fade. I even have to plan not to work afterward because it looks awful. I don\u2019t understand why they would stop buying such a basic product! I\u2019m only staying because of my hairstylist, but this definitely lowers the level of service. Fiona is awesome and what a great partnership to start my new journey in Boston! Thank you so much , Fiona, for your attention to detail, efficiency, and fun conversation today ! Great work! Sincerely, Nick I traveled all the way from Cleveland for this amazing haircut! Thank you so much Cassandra and Cherry for my beautiful pixie mullet! I love it! And I'm already sure that I nailed today's interview because I felt so good about how I looked and presented myself. I'll surely be back. I've requested someone with experience with curls. First she didn't introduce herself, I've asked for a cut, she didn't wash my hair. She kinda got it wet after I told her, then she needed instructions and help through the cut (I asked for a straight line). It turned out terrible, I was charged more without explanation. When I reached out telling my dissatisfaction, they asked my (via email) my availability to come and get it fixed, and I haven't heard back.\nNot recommending this place. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. People who put 1 star reviews here are just miserable. I am at Choice quite literally every week and I don\u2019t go anywhere else. I live right next door. Every time I come in all of the guys have a smile on their face, recognize me and wave and ask me how my day is. They have to deal with a lot of difficulties that come with being one of the best located stores in Fenway/Back Bay - please consider that before leaving any negative feedback. I came to this store visiting from the UK, and the service was great! The owners are great people and were super helpful with everything. They had great recommendations for the wine I wanted. 10/10 would go there again. Good selection. A wider variety of singles would be welcome. How about getting some beer from Africa. It was convenient to the location of my\nHotel and I bought a bottle of champagne which I found was spoiled upon popping it open. I called before walking back over there and stated the alcohol went bad and asked to bring the entire bottle back along with the receipt, all within 2 hours of purchasing and they said Nope- all sales final. Given everything just mentioned, any reasonable vendor (especially an individually owned establishment) would absolutely exchange that bottle for you or at least refund you when you provide the inventory back. Not a good way to do business. Would not risk paying for bad alcohol and being out the money and the alcohol, that doesn\u2019t help anyone. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! GO LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE\n\nDon't waste your time with these clowns. The cashier tried to take my real ID. I had to call the cops to get it back. Based on other reviews, it seems like this is a common occurrence. This place needs to be shut down.\n\nEDIT: I am over 30 years old and my ID had already been accepted at this location twice prior to my bad experience. A new cashier threatened to withhold my government issued ID, which is a crime. A typical person does not carry TWO firms of government-issued ID with them. The store's ID scanner, which appears to be from 1996, does not work. The angry, confrontational owner blames it on the customers who are unsuspecting enough to try and shop here. I am not the first person to have this experience here. While waiting for the police, another customer offered to stay and be a witness for me. I hope this place goes out of business soon or the police start fining them for the waste of time. They have very cool instruments and it's a great space. I'm not sure about how I felt on my first day of guitar lessons. I'll see as time goes on.\nAlso, I've taken my Deans guitar here to be checked.

Don't let them tell you you have to wait for over an hour to see someone for help. The bank just had opened up. Put your foot down and get what you need.  Y'all will never forget my face after February 26/2025. I had the worse experience with 2 black individuals working there. I refused to wait 40 minutes plus for something that took 3 minutes. I demanded I get assistance. If one day in the amen of Jesus I get the chance to contact there manager or boss I will have them written up. I got dismissed on this day I did not take it calmly.  If I could rate this a zero star I would. Y'all do even deserve a 1 star. Black people get good jobs and forget who the hell they are in the inside and out. you will never be as good to a white person even if you're wearing a suit and tie working in a white owned company they will always look at you the same and for you to treat your own kind the way that you did is ridiculous. FANTASTIC BANK!!! I come here daily to drop off my bank deposits for work, the entire staff is beyond friendly, kind and genuinely goes out of their way to help in any way, fantastic people 100%  Ive had such an amazing experience the last few months that I opened a personal account for myself with this bank. If you're looking for a new bank to bank with this bank specifically is it!!:)))) I used the street level counter service a couple of times during a recent trip to Boston.  I was greeted by a very professional young man who directed me to the teller.  The teller was a young lady who was very professional and efficient in providing change from larger bills.  The young man greeter and I then had a very pleasant conversation regarding Boston, business, etc...\nHe was a very articulate and charming young Asian man, originally from China.  I relayed to him my past travels in China and conducting business in China.  I don't recall his name, but he also gave me suggestions for sites to see and restaurants in Boston.  Overall, very nice experience at this BOA facility. I went into the Bank of America branch on Boylston street, Boston location and got a rude awakening of what discrimination feels like. While I was there, the check that I deposited got stuck in the ATM. I saw one of the employees assisting a Latin American woman (on the white side), so I waited for her to finish with the customer and explained my situation. Then I asked if she could assist me. She said in a nasty voice; that she didn't know how to use the machine and that I would have to contact someone outside the branch. Not at any point did she walk over to evaluate the problem. Instead, she continued to be dismissive and cold.\n\nI explained to the employee that it might be something that she could help me with since the ATM was prompting me to go back and put in the amount, but I could not find where to enter the transaction amount. She proceeded to ignore me and move on to an Asian customer that had just walked through the door. Talk about passive-aggressive. At this point, I knew that she wanted me to feel inferior, so I decided to speak up for myself, explained that I had a check worth thousands stuck in the branch's ATM, and to either assist me or call a manager. Again she argued that she did not know how to use the machine, but I held my ground.\n\nFinally, she came over, pressed a few buttons, and it turned out that she \u2018did know' how to use the machine.\nFrustrated by the employees lack of professionalism, I asked to speak with the her manager. That's when I learned that the woman discriminating against me was the branch manager. I left in disbelief. I felt like I was being pitted against the other two customers because, in her mind, I did not fit the demographics of that area. The message that I got; is that my business is not as valuable because I am black.\n\nAfter experiencing this level of disrespect and unfairness from this branch location, I hope Bank of America does something about this systematic racism amongst its employees.\nI'm sharing my story publicly because I hope people will start speaking up. And finally, I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through. This Bank of America has the worst customer service I have ever seen. My mother who speaks english as a second language went to this location at the designated appointment time provided to her. She wanted to open up a savings account for my little brother. The agent assisting her wasn't available, so the manager came over. When my Mom asked questions about the savings account and instead the manager began push other services she did not need. Once he realized she was not receptive to what he was offering he began to patronize and talk down to her. He was not willing to assist her at all. My Mother left the bank disheartened and demoralized. I am not sure if the manager has biases or needs additional training but I do not recommend anyone going to this bank. I tried to call the bank to resolve this matter and they are not picking up. I will be escalating this issue with Bank of America Headquarters. Great experience! I always get my monthly protein shake supply from here. Store owner is very helpful and knowledgeable. I came there yesterday (Friday evening), and the Asian lady was speaking fluent English until I told her that I'm here to make a return, then she started acting like she barely speak English and that she doesn't know how to make a return. It was ridiculous. I asked to call the manager, she said \"I only know the store number\", then suggested that I try a different location. It seems like each store employee in every GNC location makes up his policy regardless of the brand policy. The guy at the counter knows absolutely nothing about how to run a store.  I bought some things the previous night and realized it has Beta Alanine in it, which makes me feel funny.  I tried to return it at the this location since it on my route and they refused to honor the return policy telling me to take it to the original store I bought it at.  Yet the receipt says I can take it to ANY GNC for a return, refund, or exchange.  This location is garbage...except on Fridays when he's not there. just left the store, I went through\nmaking a return of something I bought in\nanother GNC I drove 40 minutes in\nBoston traffic which as you know is\nhorrible, so that Mr. Bobby who was in\nthe store tells me that he will not make\nthe return to me because I bought the\nmerchandise in another GNC which for\nme was a little absurd because it is the\nsame company its really didn\u2019kt Make so same Terrible attitude. Extremely aggressive. Not helpful at all. Just a bad store all around. Almost every item is locked up. Employees take at least 5 minutes to open up items and are seemingly really reluctant to do so. This is 10x more irritating if you\u2019re sick and barely made it to the pharmacy.\n\nI\u2019d argue that CVS is losing more in lost sales than the shoplifters they avoid by locking everything up. I mean, you\u2019re really going to lock up candy behind a glass door? You\u2019re a multibillion dollar corporation \ud83d\ude2d The staff here is outstandingly warm, kind and helpful. I had a small issue with a vaccine voucher and they called the issuer, figured everything out, and then called me back to let me know all was good to go to proceed. Thank you! Came in to buy laundry detergent. Nope. Free the detergent and lock up the criminals!  Thank you chairman wu and your own gang of 4 Ubered to this CVS at night to get some burn cream after a baking cookies gone wrong incident. Reached the back of the CVS at 9:52pm (it closes at 10:00pm) but the back door was already locked so I sprinted around the building to the front door, made it by 9:53pm and it was also locked. There were 2 employees in the doorway area and 2-3 employees at the registers. They just stared at me for a minute through the door before unlocking the door to rudely let me know that they weren't gonna let me in because the store was closed and I was too late (the time now is 9:54pm). I politely asked if they could please just let me in to only buy some burn cream because my hand was seriously stinging and I would be in and out in  Terrible experience. Filled my prescription incorrectly multiple times even after an incredibly detailed phone call from the prescribing physician. They truly cannot get it together and absolutely screwed me and my family so many times. One extra star for convenience in location. This was my first time visiting, and I will definitely be coming back! My experience exceeded all expectations. I stopped in yesterday to treat myself to some flowers, and the sales associate went above and beyond to help me create the perfect arrangement. The flowers were absolutely stunning\u2014fresh, vibrant, and beautifully arranged with incredible artistry and creativity. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the quality and selection. Highly recommend! I ordered flowers off the website for a friend who had surgery. I never received any kind of email confirmation and what was delivered was no where near as nice as what was pictured. So disappointing for $116!! My friend\u2019s husband has been seriously ill, constantly back and forth to the Brigham for about a year. She mentioned he\u2019s been feeling down and I asked if there were anything I could do. She suggested a card. Since she didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d be there I opted for flowers and researched florists close by and I found Fern!  What a jewel!! I spoke to the owner, described the patient and said I didn\u2019t want a feminine arrangement. He suggested going with some unique choices which sounded perfect. The icing on the cake was he offered to go next door to the grocery store and pick up a few chili peppers as our friend is a chili connoisseur. How appropriate!! My friend\u2019s husband was delighted with the arrangement and to say it was a hit is putting it mildly. Thanks again Fern for coming to the rescue. Well done \ud83d\udc4d Bruce and The Fern team are AMAZING! We came to them with a request for a floral collar for my dog for a cocktail party and then decided to add floral centerpieces as well (along with a surprise arrangement mom had ordered, its the big pink one photographed below as well, which was stunning). We called on a Tuesday needing these on the upcoming Friday and Bruce and the Fern team could not have been more accommodating or helpful - they are not only talented floral artists but also absolute professionals. We are so grateful to them and will absolutely be using them in the future and recommend them highly!!! One of our family friends ordered flowers for my daughter to be delivered for her first day at work at a new job.  She will be in and out of this office so this was a special time for her. The flowers were never delivered but were told that they were.  The building has security where they had to be dropped off and would have written down the delivery.  She checked a couple of the surrounding buildings but nothing had been delivered there by mistake. Notifying the florist and them saying they had been delivered that morning. Finally they told us they couldn't verify that they were delivered.  We both own our own businesses and knowing the right thing to do was to deliver the flowers the next day and credit back the amount to the credit card that was used.  This shop was recommended to me by someone familiar with Boston but we would never suggest this florist if asked. Been here two times now and the staff are really nice! As for the food, everything tastes slightly different than how I expect (japchae, rose tteokbokki, fried chicken, bulgogi, squid). My favorite is probably the seafood pancake. Stepping into this hidden gem of a Korean restaurant, I was greeted with the warm aromas of authentic Korean cuisine, but it was the service that elevated the entire experience to a level beyond just exceptional dining. Each dish\u2014crafted with bold flavors and authentic textures\u2014was a tribute to Korea\u2019s culinary richness. The server, whose attentiveness was unmatched, went above and beyond to bring the menu to life. Their genuine hospitality and thoughtful care made each bite more memorable, as though the flavors themselves were enhanced by the impeccable service. A dining experience that lingers, thanks to both the dishes and the warmth with which they were served. Highly recommended. Two people share one Tteok-bokki is quite enough, we chose cheese one, it has rice cake, cheese, egg, dumping...but not spicy at all \u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b (oh rice cake itself has cheese, like it) I've been to HAJU Kitchen in Boston several times and I keep returning for more! The food is consistently delicious. My favorites include the vegetable fried dumplings, Korean fried chicken, and the Jjol-Myeon cold noodles. The cold noodles were a new experience for me, and they were fantastic! The place is small but quiet, making it a nice spot to enjoy great Korean food and spend time and catch up with friends. The service is great, with friendly and welcoming servers. Plus, it's not overly expensive. HAJU Kitchen is definitely a must-try. Highly recommend! We came here for a quick lunch. Luckily we didn't came later since the store actually opened at 12:30PM. We were the first customers of the day so it makes sense that they were still getting everything cleaned and set-up. The food was so-so. We got the 3 and 4 of the lunch special which was cheaper, but the taste didn't taste any different than if I were to make it at home with little ingredients. The food was still edible, but I would expect more from a restaurant. However, the service was very good and the server asked us if we wanted more of the side dishes which was nice of her. I wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking for authentic korean dishes for a good price. So my pics do not do this place justice. The service was amazing!! The \u2018ice cream\u2019 was THE BEST! Non-dairy options!!! We are definitely going again begot we leave.. in two days!!\nMy husband had strawberry shortcake Sunday with Madagascar vanilla non-dairy ice cream. In was yummy.  Just stop by.. they ate sure to please! I loved the ice cream here! I got a cookie Sunday that was amazing! Also the staff was so helpful when it came to trying out flavors and explaining the options. The only complaint I have it the cookie at the bottom of the Sunday. It gets rock hard under the ice cream and is really hard to get to. Also the spoons are too weak to break it up. They should put the cooking sticking out of or on top of the ice cream imo. Other than that great experience over all!! You can easily find much higher quality (and more affordable) ice cream in Boston, imho. At my most recent visit, I paid $6 for a literal dixie cup ice cream with a touch of freezer burn. Usually I'm a bit more satisfied with the offerings. They do cookies and cream ice cream really well, and the seasonal flavors are usually tasty. My favorite item on the menu, however, might be their London fog latte - perfect when you're craving a sweet warm drink. I do love supporting a local chain so plan to occasionally return. The server was on the phone (his cell phone) and then when I didn\u2019t immediately give my order, he kept trying to go to the person behind me, who was in my group, but recognized I was trying to order. I kept trying to ask a question, but he wouldn\u2019t let me talk. The server was very rude and clearly wanted to get back on the phone because he was on the phone immediately after my group was finished. Enjoyed a nice ice cream here. They have plenty of options to help your sweet tooth. Smoothies, sundaes, and more. They also serve coffee and hot chocolate. I saw a flavor I haven\u2019t seen anywhere else and thought I\u2019d try it. Cookies n\u2019 cake batter. I was not disappointed. It was a unique and delicious flavor. Workers were nice and the place was clean. They have indoor and outdoor seating available I don\u2019t know why the reviews are so low! The portion sizes are massive, the price is reasonable, and, most importantly, the food is good!!!\n\nI got the short rib special with the drunken noodles and the soup dumplings and everything was absolutely fantastic. This place is so underrated and I will definitely be back. If you\u2019re in the area it\u2019s a great spot for a hearty and warm meal. We were all stuffed by the end and highly satisfied. Easily recommend this spot and worth the visit. came here to watch a concert, very happy that they were open until 2am, the owner was very nice and the food portions were very large I got the Taiwan style Dumpling soup (with Taiwan noodles) and it did not disappoint! The boba tea was excellent as well. Generous portions and prompt service. I could tell the waitress didn't speak English as a first language but she answered all of my questions and was very helpful. If I lived in Boston I would absolutely visit again! Went here for a treat, tried Chinese for the first time in Boston and the food didn't disappoint. Tried the chef's special, Mixed seafood with Spicy Sauce in Clay Pot, and it was very appealing, enjoyable and scrumptious. The pictures posted are the clay pots having more than enough quantity which goes pleasantly with rice. The staffs are very attentive and have excellent customer services. There was rush but luckily no wait time. Had a splendid evening. Great place to bring a large group of friends. Lots of the local Chinese population frequent this place, which least let's you know that the food is authentically good. We ordered various types of dumplings and meat buns. The juicy dumpling was easily the best thing that we tried. I enjoyed the food and service was quick. Would recommend even if you like traditional Chinese dishes because they had plenty of those as well. Great place for a quick place to satisfy your teriyaki and sushi cravings.\n\nWe were impressed with the quality and price for the chicken teriyaki and the Yellowtail sushi combo.  The food is freshly prepared.  The sushi combo satisfied my craving for Yellowtail sushi.\n\nDon't let the typo on the operating hours listed at the door fool you!  On weekends, they open at noon (instead of 2PM)  :-)\n\nEnjoy your visit! Ordered delivery from DoorDash. They were running dumplings BOGO. Everything in the photos are a total of $30 after discount and excluding delivery fee. A bit pricey but the food is not bad. **My Rating:** \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f - \"Consistently Good.\n\n**Swift Service:** \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nA simple, efficient counter service perfectly suits the fast-paced life of Boston's college students and busy workers.

If you\u2019re near Hynes Convention Center Station, it\u2019s definitely worth a visit. This is the second time ive gone here. The first was when I was looking for a quick place to grab a bite. The employees are quick and nice. I recommend the Fenway Special with pickled ginger added on. The Spicy Hawaiian is also super good! They are pretty generous with the scoops, and I like that the avocado is cut and scooped in front of you.\nThe prices are decent, like most poke places, it ranges $15-18 for a bowl. I would definitely come back again, it was so yummy Did an ubereats order because it was b1g1 bowls. The portions were so small and 1 out of the 4 bowls had 0 salmon poke in it. They minced the meat as well to give you less fish. Luckily it was b1g1 or it wouldn't be worth it. Food did taste good though but portions were too disappointing. Not coming back again. Stopped here for the first time and it was good choice! Poke bowl was great! I ordered two ot them and my kids loved them! Also they have good sushi rolls.  Prices are very good.  People are nice and friendly.  Clean place. Nice sushi restaurant located in Haviland street near Massachusetts Avenue boston. Various types of sushi to choose from. I went here with a friend and we got a bowl which was really nice. The price for the food was fair and it was a good value for what was offered . The staff are friendly and were able to help me in my choice . There is parking by the side of the restaurant.  Its usually busy during the day because it caters to a lot of students . The Berkeley college of music is very close to the restaurant . The poke bowls here taste pretty good. The standard toppings are offered. Haven't had any issues ordering from here, but I just wish you got more bang for your buck. I prefer New Sushi for this reason. My experience at Wendy's was delightful! I ordered the meal deal, which included a delicious double cheeseburger, crispy fries, savory chicken nuggets, and a refreshing Dr. Pepper. The double cheeseburger was a highlight, perfectly cooked with a satisfying combination of flavors. The fries were crispy and the chicken nuggets had just the right amount of crunch. The addition of Dr. Pepper completed the meal beautifully. The service was prompt, and the food quality exceeded my expectations. Wendy's meal deal is a tasty and satisfying choice for fast-food enthusiasts! I have no idea why it took over half an hour to get my food. Others came in and ordered and were served while I waited. I tried to order on the app but it didn't actually place the order until I was at the store, which made the wait time even longer. Food was okay, as expected, but it might have arrived faster if I'd door dashed. Busy busy busy, all the grub hub delivery drivers swarm the counter all over each other, basically trying to shove their phones into the employees' faces. It's a wild place. And food was cold though it just came out \"fresh\" Set in a college area of Boston.  Go in with that mind frame.\nI do need more stars for service. 5 isn't enough. 1 employee will mix frosty flavors if u want.\nChocolate and vanilla? Of course it was good. But....\nChocolate and caramel \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b OMG!! Being a frosty instead of a milkshake set it off. That's a whole vibe!! First time here from Vermont. Don't usually do this but Cassandra is amazing.  She helped me with directions and even remembered me days later lol. Food was amazing but her service was better. If you randomly see this Thank you for your help. Update: Since the new manager took over, the caf\u00e9 has been providing great customer service. It has been a wonderful experience since then.\n\nA few days ago, I ordered online medium coffee, Two donuts Frosted Chocolate, and Boston Cream.  I went to pick my order, but The manager said they were waiting for me because the donuts I ordered were not available.  She told me to go and choose from the available donuts.  So I chose one Butternut and because there are not many types there. I chose coffee roll .  And when the director heard that I had chose coffee roll.  She told me to just pick a donut rudely.  I said to her, I will pay the difference. she really made pay the difference 0.23 cents.  The staff were very nice to me. at the same time nervous from their manager. I have been ordering from this location for 2 years with no problem. I live 10 minutes away so I place the order when I leave my apartment.\n\nUsually there is never a problem, but today I showed up and my order was stolen, no big deal. I worked in food service for years and stuff like this happens on occasion.\n\nThe problem that I have is that when the manager told me that my order was stolen, she didn't apologize and made it seem like it was MY FAULT.\n\nShe remade my order, but told me she wouldn't make it again if it gets stolen again. It's not my fault that a mobile order got stolen 10 minutes after I placed it, it's the store's fault.\n\nFigure something else out if orders are stolen, don't blame your customers. Maybe Dunkin should hire a new manager that can handle conflict. I would like to preface this by saying I always try and give the benefit of the doubt to any service worker, they are underpaid and under appreciated, and the issue here was really the manger, the rest of the employees were perfectly reasonable and nice. Today I placed a mobile order for a drink and bagel like I do everyday. I live across the street and this Dunkin can get kinda busy so I normally order when I\u2019m headed out the door and then by the time I get downstairs and across the street it\u2019s usually ready or ready in a few mins but it sometimes takes up to 20-30 mins on busy days (which is understandable when they are swamped). I place an order as usual but due to some issues with the elevator in my building I showed up 15 mins after placing my order. Definitely late so my bad but sometimes it does take that long. I walked in and my food wasn\u2019t there. I am generally an anxious person so I wasn\u2019t gonna cause a fuss right away so I waited for about 10 more mins and at which no one had asked me what I needed. So I assumed someone took it, no big deal it happens. So I tell someone at the front. The manager asks me how long it was and I told her. She immediately started laying into me about how long it had been and asked me if it was \u201creasonable\u201d to expect my food to still be there after that long. I tried to explain that I came in only 15 mins after it was placed and that I don\u2019t generally try to do that but there was an issue with the elevator. I wasn\u2019t trying to make it about me I was just trying to explain I don\u2019t make it a habit and I was happy to wait for them to make a new one. She then continued to berate me in front of everyone in the store for several mins about how it\u2019s not reasonable to expect my food to be there and that they don\u2019t have security. At this point I just said I would just like my food remade as I did pay for it. She then said they would remake it but only as a courtesy and that in the future she wouldn\u2019t. I said I am a paying customer so either I am getting my food or I am getting a refund. I don\u2019t liked o use that card but I was out 10 bucks if she didn\u2019t fix the situation. She also at this point basically told me I was lying about being in the story for 10 mins when I brought up that it isn\u2019t fair to keep saying 25 mins when I was in the store 15 mins after placing my order. She loudly asked all her staff if I had been there to which no one responded (bc they were busy actually working instead of fighting with a customer) and when no one responded and she shrugged and said \u201cI guess you weren\u2019t here\u201d. She then told them to remake my stuff but only after they had served everyone in line and loudly complaining about me to the workers. Ex. Instead of just telling the person in the food line to remake a bagel she said \u201cthe girl over here that waited 25 mins to get her food needs a new one but wait till the customers who are actually here get there food first because we already made her order. At this point I told her to please not speak about my like that in front of everyone and asked her to please just be professional. Ironically it took about 20 mins after me asking to get my food. The guys who actually made my bagel was nice, hope is day goes okay despite his awful boss. I understand stuff happens and I totally would have respected if she gave me just a little heads up to place my ordered  closer to my arrival time in the future but see decided to go on and lecture me for several minute instead. She also didn\u2019t have any name tag or anything so I don\u2019t know what particular manager it was. Also the iced coffee here is bitter, no amount of sugar can save it. I am writing this review because if the absolute abysmal experience I just had. Normally, I go to the Commowealth Ave location because of poor experiences at this one. Sadly, that Dunkin is being renovated. Today, I placed an order and when I went to pick it up, it was not there. No issue. It happens. What should NOT happen is being shamed by the manager for taking so long to pick up my order, and getting told what to do \u201cnext time\u201d. I\u2019d have peacefully waited. Instead, I got a hostile manager lecturing me and then arguing with me when I explained I did it this way because this Dunkin regularly takes 20-30 minutes to make orders, which is why I don\u2019t go unless I have to. She argued that wasn\u2019t true, but it happened enough I stopped going there. I will never be going to this location again, and will wait until my preferred Dunkin is open. Would give a zero if I could for the rude, hostile, nasty, and argumentative staff if I could. She opened IMMEDIATELY with hostility for no reason. Employee there seems to have an issue with me coming into my neighborhood store see me coming she goes to where someone is doing the food or to the back whispers to another co/ worker about me Everytime I go there ; Now it's to the point where if she is not moved somewhere closer to where she lives I don't bother nobody but since she has a problem she can see my sisters she about 5\"6' use to keep her head covered now she has dreads without the scarf red stuff on one of her hands wear a black face mask sometime at least she did now working the night shift use to be there during the morning ,I say it again if she continues nip picking and whispering about me my girls will give her what she looking for Facts since she want to instigate something she has an attitude made a new night employee quite because of her harassment caverdian descent she best be removed her unprofessional conduct is in acceptable or I will notify licences board with all complaints about her We ordered chole bhature, chicken 65 dry, Hakka noodles, dhai poori chaat, and paneer biryani. The first four dishes were absolutely incredible. They were so flavorful and delicious. They had the perfect amount of spices and were amazing. Our only big issue was biryani. It was disgusting and sour for some reason. Was a lot more like pulao than biryani. The server was really nice about this though and offered to switch our dish for the dhai puri. Amazing service and handled the situation nicely. There was no one else in the restaurant. We really enjoyed our first visit to Mumbai Spice, with a large party of 6+ on a quiet Sunday night before a concert at Symphony Hall. I was particularity interested in trying the Indo-Chinese, which I haven\u2019t found at many other restaurants in greater Boston. Though I don\u2019t have much of a reference point, I found the Manchurian quite enjoyable. More typical South Asian standards were also tasty- standouts included the dahi boondi and a nicely spiced biryani with generous pieces of tender goat. They also have a decent wine list, a selection of local and Indian beers, and quite good cocktails! Service was friendly and helpful, and our dishes were turned out promptly by the kitchen. We hope to be back soon! For a Friday lunch I stopped by Mumbai Spice, having noticed their small section of Indo-Chinese food. The establishment was almost empty at noon. I ordered the lunch special, Chicken Manchurian ($18). It took 15 minutes to arrive, a bit longer than I expected, but otherwise inconsequential.\n\nThe Chicken Manchurian came with chicken in a brown sauce (imagine a thick Chinese soy-sauce based pan sauce with some Indian herbs), vegetarian fried rice, one egg roll, and soup.\n\nThe egg roll and fried rice were inoffensive. The soup seemed a touch earthy, reminiscent of middle eastern lentil soup, albeit saltier. The Chicken Manchurian could have used more Indian spices. The heat came through well, but the spices seemed muted.\n\nOverall, I think the lunch special offers a decent variety at the price point (these days). It doesn't satisfy my craving for Indo-Chinese as much as I would like, however. Service was good. Gloria was our server and checked on us multiple times. Even made sure to repeat our orders before placing it with the chefs.\n\nThe corn manchurian was a nice crunchy texture, and the saag paneer had a creamy velvet feel. Everything we ordered was spiced well.\n\nSat at the bar, and got the limited rose drink for Diwali. Comes with glitter, too! Not really sure why this has such a low rating.  We've been twice and the service was great and the food was also!  It is fusion, so not authentic one or the other, but still delicious!  This time, we had the Masala Momo's, the Lamb Rogan Josh, the Chicken Hiryali, and the Chicken 65 along with the Bullet Naan. All were delicious.  Again, the service was excellent and the decor is very nice with a modern vibe. We'll definitely be back. Here I just got a regular pho. It was pretty good pho, not the best not the worst. The service was pretty normal. Waiter was nice and food was decently quick. The vibes were nice, super chill music. Would recommend this spot to anyone who likes Vietnamese food \ud83d\udc4d Cute little place. The pho broth was extremely flavorful! The beef was also delicious and I appreciated that the pho came in a kid size if specified. The spring rolls were also very refreshing. A bit pricey tho. We went in very close to closing time but they were welcoming and didn't try to rush us out.\n\nBanh mi was very flavorful and toasted perfectly.  I wish there was more meat and veg but what there was tasted really good.  Pho was also good if slightly bland.  We asked for a small container of fish sauce and added it to the broth which made it almost perfect. Best pho I have ever tasted, and it's also affordable?!!! The meat here is not chewy at all which is quite rare I would say. The broth is 10/10, and spring rolls are a must. Made with fresh ingridients. Always a place to come back to whenever I am in town.\n\nQueue can be long as a lot of ppl lov it like i doo.... If you want an averagely good bowl of pho and not prepared to wait TWO HOURS for it, don\u2019t come to this place!!\n\nFirst off, I came to the restaurant at 12:30, and it was completely full. No one greeted me at the door, said nothing about waiting times, and there wasn\u2019t even empty chairs you could sit on to wait with. The place is painfully understaffed, with only one person doing everything, cleaning, accounting, etc. I only got a seat at around 1. Then it was another 15 minutes before I even got a cup of water. I placed my order at around 1:20, and I wasn\u2019t served until 2:00. Mind you, I ordered a regular pho dish. This isn\u2019t some fancy upend French fine dining that took their time. If the restaurant had started growing the bean sprouts when I placed the order, then the wait time would have been reasonable.\n\nThen, the quality of the food is completely not worth the wait. The pho was good, garnished nicely, but then again, this is PHO. It\u2019s not omakase. It was also 16 dollars for the regular sized pho, and the meat is at least three times less than what I\u2019ve gotten in other Vietnamese restaurants\u2019 pho for the same price. I could probably have eaten all the meat in one regular sized bite. The ribs were an extra add on.\n\nIn summary, it was expensive, extremely slow in serving, and VERY MUCH NOT WORTH IT. The restaurant is cute and well decorated, and the one person working there was doing a lot. But the understaffing isn\u2019t a consumer\u2019s problem. I would highly not recommend this place and definitely personally never coming back. Best Mexican food in Boston!! Hands down. And I grew up on Mexican food, I know. Every dish is fantastic and unique and you can taste the care and good ingredients that go into it. The spices are incredible.\n\nWe go here regularly, AND they catered our engagement party and knocked it out of the park. All the guests raved about the food the entire evening. So I tried this place a few months back and I took one bite and gave it to a homeless guy. However I decided to give it a 2nd shot. I must say very impressed. The guacamole and rice needs more flavor but overall the rice bowl was on point. There was only one guy working (which I feel is a little bit of abuse especially were this is located in the heart of symphony & Berkelee College.) The line was out the door and the guy was handling online orders, in store orders and ringing them up. He deserves a raise for real! He did all of this with such ease and greeted us all with a smile. Burrito was gross, I got cheese on it and I\u2019m pretty sure they put american cheese on it, why? The spicy chicken was dry and overcooked, and the rice was a weird texture and flavor. It\u2019s cheaper than most places, but it\u2019s easy to see why that\u2019s the case. The guy working there was nice, though I like the burrito here more than the other places in the area. And they give more meat!!!!!!!\n\nI think they are so friendly:) The price is not bad burrito bowl so good and it\u2019s big.\n\nIt\u2019s better than Amelia\u2019s and el jefe I think. Much better. I just wish they take the bay leaf out first so I don\u2019t chew on it. Stopped here to grab a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered a burrito and my husband ordered a bowl both which were very delicious!  It is a very small spot with some bar stool seating inside. Small cozy place but loud; hence, 4 stars for atmosphere . Come after lunch hours on a wed and the place already full. However, easily can join the waitlist and it moves pretty fast. Service is phenomenal as the staff are very attentive. Food is great and huge portion.\nHighly recommend this place Pho Basil is a hidden gem known among locals and it\u2019s absolutely delicious.\n\nI ordered the pho and the Panang curry. Both dishes are hit the spot. The pho broth was rich and flavorful. The Panang curry had a creamy texture with just the right kick. The vegetables paired perfectly.\n\nVisited during a rainy day and the service was impressively quick. Our food arrived without compromising on its quality. You can\u2019t beat the price. Affordable Thai/Vietnamese restaurant in Back Bay. Very efficient and fast service. I enjoyed Crispy Chicken with Tom Yum rice. Their spice is catered more toward Westerners (seems more like Asian fusion food than authentic Thai cuisine) but quality is great overall. Perhaps recommended for lunch or quick dinner. Pho Basil is undoubtedly one of the best places to have authentic Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nI had a craving for Ph\u00f5 and me and my friends ( one of them is from Vietnam) visited this restaurant. She was extremely impressed with the taste and told that the taste made her feel homesick.\n\nKudos to the generosity of the staff, this place is a must visit. \ud83d\udccd Location & Atmosphere\nPho Basil in Boston offers a cozy and casual setting, perfect for a laid-back meal. The ambiance is relaxed, with simple decor that makes it a comfortable spot for both solo diners and small groups. Its convenient location makes it a popular stop for a quick bite or a casual hangout.\n\n\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Food & Drinks\nWe started with the Thai tea, which was deliciously potent with a strong tea flavor balanced by creamy sweetness\u2014definitely a standout. The Gyoza were lightly pan-fried to a crisp, with a perfectly seasoned filling that made each bite satisfying. For the main dish, we had the Pho Dac Biet. The broth had a pleasant hint of sweetness and a flavorful finish, which helped carry the dish. However, the noodles were a bit clumped together\u2014likely from being prepackaged\u2014so you had to work a little with your chopsticks to separate them. The toppings were sparse, making the bowl feel somewhat lacking in heartiness.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 Service & Hospitality\nThe service was fine but could have been more attentive. It felt a bit disjointed, as multiple staff members were helping intermittently, making it unclear who to turn to. There were moments where we were left hanging for a bit, which took away from the overall experience.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Unique Selling Point\nPho Basil in Boston shines with its well-crafted beverages and appetizers. The Thai tea and Gyoza were definite highlights, making it a solid choice for those seeking flavorful starters and refreshing drinks. The Pho Dac Biet had a tasty broth, but the prepackaged noodles and sparse toppings slightly detracted from the experience. More attentive service would further enhance the visit. Excellent service!  Hands down, some of the best Pizza I\u2019ve had recently! The freshness of the ingredients and the unique flavors in each bite!!  Highly recommend Supreme pizza for food enthusiasts!\u201d\nThe Sicilian slice was absolutely amazing! Perfectly balanced flavors, beautifully presented, and crust is cooked to perfection. It\u2019s a must-try for anyone visiting Supreme pizza I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I would definitely recommend it. It was great for a quick and easy lunch. Decently priced too. And the portions are quite generous. The slices are huge and filling. I'll start by saying that I was born and raised in NY, just outside the Bronx. Pizzerias are dime a dozen in metro NY, kinda like Dunks is here. Everyone has their favorite neighborhood pizzaria, and it's more than just a place to get a slice. That being said, good pizza is in the top 3 things I kiss most about NYC since moving to Massachusetts about 10 years ago. I went to college here and I remember being appalled at what was considered \"pizza\". Bar pizza or \"Greek-style\" pizza is usually what you find, and honestly, it's an abomination compared to authentic NY pizza. I have been on a 10+ year quest for a good NY style slice in Boston, metrowest, SE Mass, and the Cape and Islands. Finally, I was told about Supreme and gave it a try. It's the closest thing I've had to real NY style pizza here in MA. Both the food and the place itself remind me of NY. I saw a lot of bad reviews about the rude staff, mostly from 5+ years ago. I didn't find anyone being anywhere even close to rude here, but I'm used to dealing with pushy New Yorkers with a bad attitude, so maybe I'm biased. Definitely give this place a shot if you like NY pizza. If you want frozen bar pizza that just spent 2 minutes in the microwave, go somewhere else. I wish it were closer to where I live, but either way, I know I'll be back. 10/10 The food is amazing and the staff there are always friendly and recognize me by name! The chicken is always made fresh and crispy when I order one! And the pizza is cooked well with a crispiness! My go to at least once a week! My husband and I stumbled upon this slice of heaven last weekend on our trip to Boston. After our early AM flight, we hit opening day @ Fenway then needed a nap afterwards. Starving when I woke up, I found a pizza joint within a few minute walk from our hotel on Newbury, truly not expecting much since they were open so late. My husband and I both agree that this was hands down the best pizza we've had in a very long time, if not ever. We tried the cheese, pepperoni, and buffalo chicken slices. We went the next night, too. We wish we had a place like this near our home in NC. You guys are a true gem. We look forward to coming back and trying more of your menu. We came here on a Friday night and was glad we found seats immediately. While it was busy, we were able to order online and our food came out quickly.\nThe food was okay. The broth for the ramen tasted similar to the broth for the rice noodles. The meat in the ramen and ribs in the rice noodles were a bit tough, including the karaage chicken. Prices were average-you had an option to add extras for more. I liked how there was a combo option for the entree, appetizer, and a drink.\nThe atmosphere was lively and catered towards the students in the area. First visit. Enjoy food. Service was good. Wasn't too busy on a Saturday afternoon. When you see a Chinese restaurant with an awkward mid 3 ratings on yelp with people yapping about the service and hygiene, you know it'll be pretty decent.\n\nThe Chinese crepe ($10.95) is a must have. The chewy crepe with soft eggs and sausage, a crunchy chip-like thing, and perfectly umami sauce, what more could you possibly ask for?\n\nThe gyoza ($7.95) is fully fried so super crispy outside and juicy inside \u2014until it sits for a bit and gets kind of sad, so better eat fast.\n\nThe spicy beef tripe ($13.95) is a cold dish, the well-seasoned chewy tripe coupled with crunchy peanuts is a perfect balance.\n\nAs a lamb addict, I had to go for the spicy lamb soup ($15.95), and trust me, it hit. Cumin on top, extra chili from me, and those rice noodles soaked up every bit of flavor.\n\nThe ramen ($14.95)? Eh, it\u2019s there. It\u2019s got all the ingredients, but like... was I supposed to feel something?\n\nPortions are decent, service (or lack thereof) is speedy, and the vibe is super laid back. I'd definitely be back for that crepe and those noodles. I love to go to this place for the convenient location due to it being between many universities, but the food isn\u2019t always consistent when I get there. Sometimes the broth can be too watery when receiving the rice noodles however it\u2019s usually great! My favorite dish here is for sure the Chinese Crepe! It has a nice crisp to it and a strong flavor to it! I usually get the Tomato Beef Rice Noodle! The beef in the soup has been really chewy and hard to bite through in the recent times I have gotten it but asides from then it has been really tasty especially when you add extra spice to it! Great food at a very convenient location for surprisingly good prices. Very prompt and friendly service too This is the second time ive gone here. The first was when I was looking for a quick place to grab a bite. The employees are quick and nice. I recommend the Fenway Special with pickled ginger added on. The Spicy Hawaiian is also super good! They are pretty generous with the scoops, and I like that the avocado is cut and scooped in front of you.\nThe prices are decent, like most poke places, it ranges $15-18 for a bowl. I would definitely come back again, it was so yummy Did an ubereats order because it was b1g1 bowls. The portions were so small and 1 out of the 4 bowls had 0 salmon poke in it. They minced the meat as well to give you less fish. Luckily it was b1g1 or it wouldn't be worth it. Food did taste good though but portions were too disappointing. Not coming back again. Stopped here for the first time and it was good choice! Poke bowl was great! I ordered two ot them and my kids loved them! Also they have good sushi rolls.  Prices are very good.  People are nice and friendly.  Clean place. Nice sushi restaurant located in Haviland street near Massachusetts Avenue boston. Various types of sushi to choose from. I went here with a friend and we got a bowl which was really nice. The price for the food was fair and it was a good value for what was offered . The staff are friendly and were able to help me in my choice . There is parking by the side of the restaurant.  Its usually busy during the day because it caters to a lot of students . The Berkeley college of music is very close to the restaurant . The poke bowls here taste pretty good. The standard toppings are offered. Haven't had any issues ordering from here, but I just wish you got more bang for your buck. I prefer New Sushi for this reason. My experience at Wendy's was delightful! I ordered the meal deal, which included a delicious double cheeseburger, crispy fries, savory chicken nuggets, and a refreshing Dr. Pepper. The double cheeseburger was a highlight, perfectly cooked with a satisfying combination of flavors. The fries were crispy and the chicken nuggets had just the right amount of crunch. The addition of Dr. Pepper completed the meal beautifully. The service was prompt, and the food quality exceeded my expectations. Wendy's meal deal is a tasty and satisfying choice for fast-food enthusiasts! I have no idea why it took over half an hour to get my food. Others came in and ordered and were served while I waited. I tried to order on the app but it didn't actually place the order until I was at the store, which made the wait time even longer. Food was okay, as expected, but it might have arrived faster if I'd door dashed. Busy busy busy, all the grub hub delivery drivers swarm the counter all over each other, basically trying to shove their phones into the employees' faces. It's a wild place. And food was cold though it just came out \"fresh\" Set in a college area of Boston.  Go in with that mind frame.\nI do need more stars for service. 5 isn't enough. 1 employee will mix frosty flavors if u want.\nChocolate and vanilla? Of course it was good. But....\nChocolate and caramel \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b OMG!! Being a frosty instead of a milkshake set it off. That's a whole vibe!! First time here from Vermont. Don't usually do this but Cassandra is amazing.  She helped me with directions and even remembered me days later lol. Food was amazing but her service was better. If you randomly see this Thank you for your help. Update: Since the new manager took over, the caf\u00e9 has been providing great customer service. It has been a wonderful experience since then.\n\nA few days ago, I ordered online medium coffee, Two donuts Frosted Chocolate, and Boston Cream.  I went to pick my order, but The manager said they were waiting for me because the donuts I ordered were not available.  She told me to go and choose from the available donuts.  So I chose one Butternut and because there are not many types there. I chose coffee roll .  And when the director heard that I had chose coffee roll.  She told me to just pick a donut rudely.  I said to her, I will pay the difference. she really made pay the difference 0.23 cents.  The staff were very nice to me. at the same time nervous from their manager. I have been ordering from this location for 2 years with no problem. I live 10 minutes away so I place the order when I leave my apartment.\n\nUsually there is never a problem, but today I showed up and my order was stolen, no big deal. I worked in food service for years and stuff like this happens on occasion.\n\nThe problem that I have is that when the manager told me that my order was stolen, she didn't apologize and made it seem like it was MY FAULT.\n\nShe remade my order, but told me she wouldn't make it again if it gets stolen again. It's not my fault that a mobile order got stolen 10 minutes after I placed it, it's the store's fault.\n\nFigure something else out if orders are stolen, don't blame your customers. Maybe Dunkin should hire a new manager that can handle conflict. I would like to preface this by saying I always try and give the benefit of the doubt to any service worker, they are underpaid and under appreciated, and the issue here was really the manger, the rest of the employees were perfectly reasonable and nice. Today I placed a mobile order for a drink and bagel like I do everyday. I live across the street and this Dunkin can get kinda busy so I normally order when I\u2019m headed out the door and then by the time I get downstairs and across the street it\u2019s usually ready or ready in a few mins but it sometimes takes up to 20-30 mins on busy days (which is understandable when they are swamped). I place an order as usual but due to some issues with the elevator in my building I showed up 15 mins after placing my order. Definitely late so my bad but sometimes it does take that long. I walked in and my food wasn\u2019t there. I am generally an anxious person so I wasn\u2019t gonna cause a fuss right away so I waited for about 10 more mins and at which no one had asked me what I needed. So I assumed someone took it, no big deal it happens. So I tell someone at the front. The manager asks me how long it was and I told her. She immediately started laying into me about how long it had been and asked me if it was \u201creasonable\u201d to expect my food to still be there after that long. I tried to explain that I came in only 15 mins after it was placed and that I don\u2019t generally try to do that but there was an issue with the elevator. I wasn\u2019t trying to make it about me I was just trying to explain I don\u2019t make it a habit and I was happy to wait for them to make a new one. She then continued to berate me in front of everyone in the store for several mins about how it\u2019s not reasonable to expect my food to be there and that they don\u2019t have security. At this point I just said I would just like my food remade as I did pay for it. She then said they would remake it but only as a courtesy and that in the future she wouldn\u2019t. I said I am a paying customer so either I am getting my food or I am getting a refund. I don\u2019t liked o use that card but I was out 10 bucks if she didn\u2019t fix the situation. She also at this point basically told me I was lying about being in the story for 10 mins when I brought up that it isn\u2019t fair to keep saying 25 mins when I was in the store 15 mins after placing my order. She loudly asked all her staff if I had been there to which no one responded (bc they were busy actually working instead of fighting with a customer) and when no one responded and she shrugged and said \u201cI guess you weren\u2019t here\u201d. She then told them to remake my stuff but only after they had served everyone in line and loudly complaining about me to the workers. Ex. Instead of just telling the person in the food line to remake a bagel she said \u201cthe girl over here that waited 25 mins to get her food needs a new one but wait till the customers who are actually here get there food first because we already made her order. At this point I told her to please not speak about my like that in front of everyone and asked her to please just be professional. Ironically it took about 20 mins after me asking to get my food. The guys who actually made my bagel was nice, hope is day goes okay despite his awful boss. I understand stuff happens and I totally would have respected if she gave me just a little heads up to place my ordered  closer to my arrival time in the future but see decided to go on and lecture me for several minute instead. She also didn\u2019t have any name tag or anything so I don\u2019t know what particular manager it was. Also the iced coffee here is bitter, no amount of sugar can save it. I am writing this review because if the absolute abysmal experience I just had. Normally, I go to the Commowealth Ave location because of poor experiences at this one. Sadly, that Dunkin is being renovated. Today, I placed an order and when I went to pick it up, it was not there. No issue. It happens. What should NOT happen is being shamed by the manager for taking so long to pick up my order, and getting told what to do \u201cnext time\u201d. I\u2019d have peacefully waited. Instead, I got a hostile manager lecturing me and then arguing with me when I explained I did it this way because this Dunkin regularly takes 20-30 minutes to make orders, which is why I don\u2019t go unless I have to. She argued that wasn\u2019t true, but it happened enough I stopped going there. I will never be going to this location again, and will wait until my preferred Dunkin is open. Would give a zero if I could for the rude, hostile, nasty, and argumentative staff if I could. She opened IMMEDIATELY with hostility for no reason. Employee there seems to have an issue with me coming into my neighborhood store see me coming she goes to where someone is doing the food or to the back whispers to another co/ worker about me Everytime I go there ; Now it's to the point where if she is not moved somewhere closer to where she lives I don't bother nobody but since she has a problem she can see my sisters she about 5\"6' use to keep her head covered now she has dreads without the scarf red stuff on one of her hands wear a black face mask sometime at least she did now working the night shift use to be there during the morning ,I say it again if she continues nip picking and whispering about me my girls will give her what she looking for Facts since she want to instigate something she has an attitude made a new night employee quite because of her harassment caverdian descent she best be removed her unprofessional conduct is in acceptable or I will notify licences board with all complaints about her We ordered chole bhature, chicken 65 dry, Hakka noodles, dhai poori chaat, and paneer biryani. The first four dishes were absolutely incredible. They were so flavorful and delicious. They had the perfect amount of spices and were amazing. Our only big issue was biryani. It was disgusting and sour for some reason. Was a lot more like pulao than biryani. The server was really nice about this though and offered to switch our dish for the dhai puri. Amazing service and handled the situation nicely. There was no one else in the restaurant. We really enjoyed our first visit to Mumbai Spice, with a large party of 6+ on a quiet Sunday night before a concert at Symphony Hall. I was particularity interested in trying the Indo-Chinese, which I haven\u2019t found at many other restaurants in greater Boston. Though I don\u2019t have much of a reference point, I found the Manchurian quite enjoyable. More typical South Asian standards were also tasty- standouts included the dahi boondi and a nicely spiced biryani with generous pieces of tender goat. They also have a decent wine list, a selection of local and Indian beers, and quite good cocktails! Service was friendly and helpful, and our dishes were turned out promptly by the kitchen. We hope to be back soon! For a Friday lunch I stopped by Mumbai Spice, having noticed their small section of Indo-Chinese food. The establishment was almost empty at noon. I ordered the lunch special, Chicken Manchurian ($18). It took 15 minutes to arrive, a bit longer than I expected, but otherwise inconsequential.\n\nThe Chicken Manchurian came with chicken in a brown sauce (imagine a thick Chinese soy-sauce based pan sauce with some Indian herbs), vegetarian fried rice, one egg roll, and soup.\n\nThe egg roll and fried rice were inoffensive. The soup seemed a touch earthy, reminiscent of middle eastern lentil soup, albeit saltier. The Chicken Manchurian could have used more Indian spices. The heat came through well, but the spices seemed muted.\n\nOverall, I think the lunch special offers a decent variety at the price point (these days). It doesn't satisfy my craving for Indo-Chinese as much as I would like, however. Service was good. Gloria was our server and checked on us multiple times. Even made sure to repeat our orders before placing it with the chefs.\n\nThe corn manchurian was a nice crunchy texture, and the saag paneer had a creamy velvet feel. Everything we ordered was spiced well.\n\nSat at the bar, and got the limited rose drink for Diwali. Comes with glitter, too! Not really sure why this has such a low rating.  We've been twice and the service was great and the food was also!  It is fusion, so not authentic one or the other, but still delicious!  This time, we had the Masala Momo's, the Lamb Rogan Josh, the Chicken Hiryali, and the Chicken 65 along with the Bullet Naan. All were delicious.  Again, the service was excellent and the decor is very nice with a modern vibe. We'll definitely be back. Here I just got a regular pho. It was pretty good pho, not the best not the worst. The service was pretty normal. Waiter was nice and food was decently quick. The vibes were nice, super chill music. Would recommend this spot to anyone who likes Vietnamese food \ud83d\udc4d Cute little place. The pho broth was extremely flavorful! The beef was also delicious and I appreciated that the pho came in a kid size if specified. The spring rolls were also very refreshing. A bit pricey tho. We went in very close to closing time but they were welcoming and didn't try to rush us out.\n\nBanh mi was very flavorful and toasted perfectly.  I wish there was more meat and veg but what there was tasted really good.  Pho was also good if slightly bland.  We asked for a small container of fish sauce and added it to the broth which made it almost perfect. Best pho I have ever tasted, and it's also affordable?!!! The meat here is not chewy at all which is quite rare I would say. The broth is 10/10, and spring rolls are a must. Made with fresh ingridients. Always a place to come back to whenever I am in town.\n\nQueue can be long as a lot of ppl lov it like i doo.... If you want an averagely good bowl of pho and not prepared to wait TWO HOURS for it, don\u2019t come to this place!!\n\nFirst off, I came to the restaurant at 12:30, and it was completely full. No one greeted me at the door, said nothing about waiting times, and there wasn\u2019t even empty chairs you could sit on to wait with. The place is painfully understaffed, with only one person doing everything, cleaning, accounting, etc. I only got a seat at around 1. Then it was another 15 minutes before I even got a cup of water. I placed my order at around 1:20, and I wasn\u2019t served until 2:00. Mind you, I ordered a regular pho dish. This isn\u2019t some fancy upend French fine dining that took their time. If the restaurant had started growing the bean sprouts when I placed the order, then the wait time would have been reasonable.\n\nThen, the quality of the food is completely not worth the wait. The pho was good, garnished nicely, but then again, this is PHO. It\u2019s not omakase. It was also 16 dollars for the regular sized pho, and the meat is at least three times less than what I\u2019ve gotten in other Vietnamese restaurants\u2019 pho for the same price. I could probably have eaten all the meat in one regular sized bite. The ribs were an extra add on.\n\nIn summary, it was expensive, extremely slow in serving, and VERY MUCH NOT WORTH IT. The restaurant is cute and well decorated, and the one person working there was doing a lot. But the understaffing isn\u2019t a consumer\u2019s problem. I would highly not recommend this place and definitely personally never coming back. Best Mexican food in Boston!! Hands down. And I grew up on Mexican food, I know.

And they give more meat!!!!!!!\n\nI think they are so friendly:) The price is not bad burrito bowl so good and it\u2019s big.\n\nIt\u2019s better than Amelia\u2019s and el jefe I think. Much better. I just wish they take the bay leaf out first so I don\u2019t chew on it. Stopped here to grab a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised.

The toppings were sparse, making the bowl feel somewhat lacking in heartiness.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 Service & Hospitality\nThe service was fine but could have been more attentive. It felt a bit disjointed, as multiple staff members were helping intermittently, making it unclear who to turn to. There were moments where we were left hanging for a bit, which took away from the overall experience.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Unique Selling Point\nPho Basil in Boston shines with its well-crafted beverages and appetizers. The Thai tea and Gyoza were definite highlights, making it a solid choice for those seeking flavorful starters and refreshing drinks. The Pho Dac Biet had a tasty broth, but the prepackaged noodles and sparse toppings slightly detracted from the experience. More attentive service would further enhance the visit. Excellent service!  Hands down, some of the best Pizza I\u2019ve had recently! The freshness of the ingredients and the unique flavors in each bite!!  Highly recommend Supreme pizza for food enthusiasts!\u201d\nThe Sicilian slice was absolutely amazing! Perfectly balanced flavors, beautifully presented, and crust is cooked to perfection. It\u2019s a must-try for anyone visiting Supreme pizza I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I would definitely recommend it. It was great for a quick and easy lunch. Decently priced too. And the portions are quite generous. The slices are huge and filling. I'll start by saying that I was born and raised in NY, just outside the Bronx. Pizzerias are dime a dozen in metro NY, kinda like Dunks is here. Everyone has their favorite neighborhood pizzaria, and it's more than just a place to get a slice. That being said, good pizza is in the top 3 things I kiss most about NYC since moving to Massachusetts about 10 years ago. I went to college here and I remember being appalled at what was considered \"pizza\". Bar pizza or \"Greek-style\" pizza is usually what you find, and honestly, it's an abomination compared to authentic NY pizza. I have been on a 10+ year quest for a good NY style slice in Boston, metrowest, SE Mass, and the Cape and Islands. Finally, I was told about Supreme and gave it a try. It's the closest thing I've had to real NY style pizza here in MA. Both the food and the place itself remind me of NY. I saw a lot of bad reviews about the rude staff, mostly from 5+ years ago. I didn't find anyone being anywhere even close to rude here, but I'm used to dealing with pushy New Yorkers with a bad attitude, so maybe I'm biased. Definitely give this place a shot if you like NY pizza. If you want frozen bar pizza that just spent 2 minutes in the microwave, go somewhere else. I wish it were closer to where I live, but either way, I know I'll be back. 10/10 The food is amazing and the staff there are always friendly and recognize me by name! The chicken is always made fresh and crispy when I order one! And the pizza is cooked well with a crispiness! My go to at least once a week! My husband and I stumbled upon this slice of heaven last weekend on our trip to Boston. After our early AM flight, we hit opening day @ Fenway then needed a nap afterwards. Starving when I woke up, I found a pizza joint within a few minute walk from our hotel on Newbury, truly not expecting much since they were open so late. My husband and I both agree that this was hands down the best pizza we've had in a very long time, if not ever. We tried the cheese, pepperoni, and buffalo chicken slices. We went the next night, too. We wish we had a place like this near our home in NC. You guys are a true gem. We look forward to coming back and trying more of your menu. We came here on a Friday night and was glad we found seats immediately. While it was busy, we were able to order online and our food came out quickly.\nThe food was okay. The broth for the ramen tasted similar to the broth for the rice noodles. The meat in the ramen and ribs in the rice noodles were a bit tough, including the karaage chicken. Prices were average-you had an option to add extras for more. I liked how there was a combo option for the entree, appetizer, and a drink.\nThe atmosphere was lively and catered towards the students in the area. First visit. Enjoy food. Service was good. Wasn't too busy on a Saturday afternoon. When you see a Chinese restaurant with an awkward mid 3 ratings on yelp with people yapping about the service and hygiene, you know it'll be pretty decent.\n\nThe Chinese crepe ($10.95) is a must have. The chewy crepe with soft eggs and sausage, a crunchy chip-like thing, and perfectly umami sauce, what more could you possibly ask for?\n\nThe gyoza ($7.95) is fully fried so super crispy outside and juicy inside \u2014until it sits for a bit and gets kind of sad, so better eat fast.\n\nThe spicy beef tripe ($13.95) is a cold dish, the well-seasoned chewy tripe coupled with crunchy peanuts is a perfect balance.\n\nAs a lamb addict, I had to go for the spicy lamb soup ($15.95), and trust me, it hit. Cumin on top, extra chili from me, and those rice noodles soaked up every bit of flavor.\n\nThe ramen ($14.95)? Eh, it\u2019s there. It\u2019s got all the ingredients, but like... was I supposed to feel something?\n\nPortions are decent, service (or lack thereof) is speedy, and the vibe is super laid back. I'd definitely be back for that crepe and those noodles. I love to go to this place for the convenient location due to it being between many universities, but the food isn\u2019t always consistent when I get there. Sometimes the broth can be too watery when receiving the rice noodles however it\u2019s usually great! My favorite dish here is for sure the Chinese Crepe! It has a nice crisp to it and a strong flavor to it! I usually get the Tomato Beef Rice Noodle! The beef in the soup has been really chewy and hard to bite through in the recent times I have gotten it but asides from then it has been really tasty especially when you add extra spice to it! Great food at a very convenient location for surprisingly good prices. Very prompt and friendly service too Food: I got the salad platter with chicken & lamb. It was rather bland in flavor, all I could taste is diluted white sauce which should be more creamy, tangy, and garlicky. They did put a good amount of chicken and taste rather tender, but ediable at best. The lamb wasn't as gamey which isn't bad but I didn't nearly had the same amount as I did with the chicken.\n\nService: The service was fine, they made sure I got everything I wanted in my salad. There's muiltiple team-members helping you out in the stations so pay attention to where your food is going as each section moves.\n\nAmbiance:It was during a rush after a concert ended so it was a bit chaotic, it's small and def gives off the vibe of when you're out and hungry, this is the place to grab a quick bite.\n\nLocation accommodation: They have a limited ourdoor seating and there barely side parking as this is near a college so theres quite amount of people traffic passing by. We got food from here for the first time through Uber eats while it was on special offer. We had the lamb gyro, chicken over rice platter, baklava, Honey cake. The food was so amazing, came with nice sauce and flavor. Great meat portion, fresh salads and sides. Price was so affordable even without the offer. The food portion was large and good for the price. We purchased from this place two times after our first time. Definitely a great place to try some Mediterranean foods. This place used to be good. Not anymore. Stay away at any cost. Ordered Combo rice (Chicken + Lamb) through Uber Eats for pickup. Serving size was half the usual size they serve. So the offer buy 1, get 1 free was a scam to lure more customers. There is barely any chicken or lamb, this is a straight up robbery. They consistently get my order wrong in delivery. I didn't mind until I got a stomach virus eating from their platter. I'm sure of it too since it was the only thing I ate that day. Really like this place. Very tasty and loaded to the max. If you\u2019re hungry this place hits the spot. Really nice workers inside and place was very clean. Friendly staff and look forward to coming back here again for a tasty meal. Wow!  Fabulous food. And everything is vegan! The best avocado toast I have ever had - they don\u2019t skimp on the avocado like so many places do. And such thick, delicious smoothies. We were blown away by how good the food was. Highly recommended. Absolutely incredibly amazing food! The ingredients are so nourishing, a great price and so flavorful and delicious. One of the best places I\u2019ve eaten in a long time. Salad also came with delicious side of homemade whole wheat bread. Delicious salads, fresh pressed juices, smoothies blended on the spot and more made with all Organic ingredients! I work at the grocery store across the street and supply them when they run out so not only can I assure you they are always buying only Organic but they have a great location to make sure they don\u2019t run out of key ingredients at the Mass Ave. store. Wonderful, friendly and motivated staff and great leadership from owner and management. My kids love acai, so we decided to try this place on our way to the library. We were pleasantly surprised by the taste of the smoothie bowls, the presentation, and the attentiveness of the staff. It's a place we want to return to. For a place that specializes in healthy food, this place takes the cake in terms of taste, quality and healthiness. Very big fan of the food items and I think that it gives vegan food justice in showing what it\u2019s true potential can be.\n\nProtein bowl 5/5. Very filling. Had no idea a vegan bowl can be this good.\n\nHappiness smoothie - 5/5. Great ingredients, quite tasty. I absolutely love Manhattan Bagel and Coffee!\n\nThe lattes here are consistently amazing\u2014perfectly brewed every single time. It\u2019s become my go-to spot when I\u2019m rushing in the morning and need a much-needed pick-me-up. The atmosphere is uniquely funky (the owner did the artwork!), but what truly sets this place apart is the incredible staff. They are, without a doubt, some of the nicest and most welcoming people, and I always look forward to seeing them. Special shoutout to Monte, Nupura, and Pardu\u2014each of them is not only friendly but also genuinely cares about their regular customers. I can't recommend this place enough for fantastic coffee, a fun vibe, and unbeatable service.\n\nFive stars! \u2615\u2728 With a  name like \u201cManhattan Bagel\u201d I had the mistaken impression that this would be a New York style bagel shop.  Turns out it\u2019s probably not possible to get further from.  From a small, soggy, floppy warm bagel (NY bagels are huge and crusty \u2014 although sometimes toasted) to inauthentic varieties to fast food restaurant preparation and presentation \u2026 misses on all marks.\n\nBut the floor was clean and the was cheeky neon? I love the bagel sandwiches and tater tots but they put the coffee for delivery in bags. I get a soggy three quarters of the $5 coffee I paid for. The owner said it was the delivery person's fault. The delivery person isn't packaging the food and beverages. Use cupholders, not bags. What a great little find tucked in a prime location, whether you are walking the sites, or getting ready to hit the road out of town. A delicious array of baked goods, almond croissant to die for, and the best mouth watering muffins...A true gem in the city. Will be going back next time in town. A great spot for a fresh, delicious breakfast! Their bagels are perfectly chewy and the coffee is always flavorful. The staff is friendly and the service is quick, even during busy hours. Highly recommend if you're looking for a solid bagel and coffee fix!\" Came here to take a workout class which was actually fantastic - the I instructor was great. My only complain is about the venue itself - there wasn't much ventilation in the room and it got pretty stuffy and smelly during the class!"

    "reviews": "After wearing my hair as a ponytail for 5 years and carelessly cutting it on my own, I brought my grossly out of shape and confused hair to Scott, and showed him a photo from the day before, which I took when trying to figure out what I want. When I came home and took another photo, couldn\u2019t believe that he made it exactly the same. See attached.\n\nI feel like I discovered sth new about myself and it\u2019s so refreshing to feel like that again at 35.\n\nBut the best part is I feel like I have a new friend in Boston\u2026 Multiple things were wrong with this place. I came in for a 6pm appointment at 545, waited 20 minutes, and when i asked a man working at the desk what was going on with my appointment he told me to approach a barber while they were with a client and ask, saying it wasn\u2019t his problem. Then, my barber absolutely destroyed the back of my neck. They left it bleeding, swollen, and red. My barber did not listen to me at all, as I asked for a low taper and did not receive any form of taper or fade whatsoever. Its been 8 hours since my haircut and my neck is still swollen. Will never be back. I had one of the worst experiences getting a haircut here. I tried to communicate my preferences multiple times, but the stylist kept insisting she knew what she was doing. Unfortunately, the result was a complete mess, leaving my hair nothing like what I wanted. It was clear she wasn\u2019t listening, which made the experience frustrating. I highly recommend not getting a haircut from her. I had gotten a haircut someplace else and they did not do well. I went to Scott later that day and he did an amazing job. He fixed me up. I\u2019m sure the others also do an amazing job, the place looks professional and has a nice vibe. Kristina at Vixx is an excellent hairstylist! I actually followed her from her last salon because she's just that good. She helped me come back from a horrible haircut from another stylist (layers started at the top of my neck, my longest layers were mid-back... HELP). Kristina always manages to give me tons of volume and body even with my long, fine hair. I always feel like a bombshell for weeks after she cuts my hair. She is super capable and efficient, and gives me exactly the look I'm hoping for every time. Definitely give Kristina a try, you won't regret it. I had an amazing experience at the UPS Store, thanks to Victor! From the moment I walked in, he greeted me with a warm smile and was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. He was efficient, knowledgeable, and took the time to ensure that my package was handled with care. His professionalism and attention to detail made the whole transaction smooth and stress-free.\n\nVictor\u2019s friendly and positive attitude truly stood out. He went above and beyond to answer my questions and made sure I had everything I needed. It\u2019s rare to find such exceptional customer service these days, and I genuinely appreciate his kindness and dedication. If you\u2019re visiting this UPS Store, I highly recommend asking for Victor\u2014he\u2019s fantastic! Today, I visited the UPS Store and was warmly greeted by Victor. He was incredibly courteous, professional, and kind while assisting me with a return. Victor went above and beyond by helping me tape my package and providing a tracking number to ensure it reaches its destination. His outstanding service truly stood out, and I felt compelled to leave this review to acknowledge his professionalism and dedication. I genuinely hope he gets the recognition he deserves\u2014maybe even a raise! Thank you again, Victor, for your exceptional help today. I truly appreciate it! The staff at this UPS Store are fantastic always friendly, professional, and super helpful. One of the reps went out of their way to make sure my package was packed securely. Great service every time I visit! Lia consistently delivers professional and efficient service with a balanced, friendly approach. Her attention to detail and reliability make every visit a positive experience. She's truly a valuable team member who deserves\u00a0recognition. I just want to say victor and Leah and the best my transaction was outstanding. They informed me about everything I need to know about my return shipping plus more Informal things I didn\u2019t know. Overall I\u2019m super happy I got everything done with them and appreciate ups for hiring such a great team thank you guys and girls at the store your the best. The bank is the problem the problem is the people that work at the bank. Don't let them tell you you have to wait for over an hour to see someone for help. The bank just had opened up. Put your foot down and get what you need.  Y'all will never forget my face after February 26/2025. I had the worse experience with 2 black individuals working there. I refused to wait 40 minutes plus for something that took 3 minutes. I demanded I get assistance. If one day in the amen of Jesus I get the chance to contact there manager or boss I will have them written up. I got dismissed on this day I did not take it calmly.  If I could rate this a zero star I would. Y'all do even deserve a 1 star. Black people get good jobs and forget who the hell they are in the inside and out. you will never be as good to a white person even if you're wearing a suit and tie working in a white owned company they will always look at you the same and for you to treat your own kind the way that you did is ridiculous. FANTASTIC BANK!!! I come here daily to drop off my bank deposits for work, the entire staff is beyond friendly, kind and genuinely goes out of their way to help in any way, fantastic people 100%  Ive had such an amazing experience the last few months that I opened a personal account for myself with this bank. If you're looking for a new bank to bank with this bank specifically is it!!:)))) I used the street level counter service a couple of times during a recent trip to Boston.  I was greeted by a very professional young man who directed me to the teller.  The teller was a young lady who was very professional and efficient in providing change from larger bills.  The young man greeter and I then had a very pleasant conversation regarding Boston, business, etc...\nHe was a very articulate and charming young Asian man, originally from China.  I relayed to him my past travels in China and conducting business in China.  I don't recall his name, but he also gave me suggestions for sites to see and restaurants in Boston.  Overall, very nice experience at this BOA facility. I went into the Bank of America branch on Boylston street, Boston location and got a rude awakening of what discrimination feels like. While I was there, the check that I deposited got stuck in the ATM. I saw one of the employees assisting a Latin American woman (on the white side), so I waited for her to finish with the customer and explained my situation. Then I asked if she could assist me. She said in a nasty voice; that she didn't know how to use the machine and that I would have to contact someone outside the branch. Not at any point did she walk over to evaluate the problem. Instead, she continued to be dismissive and cold.\n\nI explained to the employee that it might be something that she could help me with since the ATM was prompting me to go back and put in the amount, but I could not find where to enter the transaction amount. She proceeded to ignore me and move on to an Asian customer that had just walked through the door. Talk about passive-aggressive. At this point, I knew that she wanted me to feel inferior, so I decided to speak up for myself, explained that I had a check worth thousands stuck in the branch's ATM, and to either assist me or call a manager. Again she argued that she did not know how to use the machine, but I held my ground.\n\nFinally, she came over, pressed a few buttons, and it turned out that she \u2018did know' how to use the machine.\nFrustrated by the employees lack of professionalism, I asked to speak with the her manager. That's when I learned that the woman discriminating against me was the branch manager. I left in disbelief. I felt like I was being pitted against the other two customers because, in her mind, I did not fit the demographics of that area. The message that I got; is that my business is not as valuable because I am black.\n\nAfter experiencing this level of disrespect and unfairness from this branch location, I hope Bank of America does something about this systematic racism amongst its employees.\nI'm sharing my story publicly because I hope people will start speaking up. And finally, I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through. This Bank of America has the worst customer service I have ever seen. My mother who speaks english as a second language went to this location at the designated appointment time provided to her. She wanted to open up a savings account for my little brother. The agent assisting her wasn't available, so the manager came over. When my Mom asked questions about the savings account and instead the manager began push other services she did not need. Once he realized she was not receptive to what he was offering he began to patronize and talk down to her. He was not willing to assist her at all. My Mother left the bank disheartened and demoralized. I am not sure if the manager has biases or needs additional training but I do not recommend anyone going to this bank. I tried to call the bank to resolve this matter and they are not picking up. I will be escalating this issue with Bank of America Headquarters. Many Indian delicacies are available but at somewhat higher price. Some frozen food items are available at reasonable price. Great store but a few months ago they ran out of the deep cocktail potato samosas. These were my favorite product and they still haven\u2019t restocked. If the store sees this, please try to add this back to your inventory. I am very sad to change this review from 5-stars to 3 stars.\n\nPlenty about this place still slaps -- the spice wall is unrivaled, great ramen selection, frozen paneer and breads, as well as dosa batter.\n\nThe prices have evidently gone up. I went recently and paid almost $60 for a single bag of groceries -- granted, here's what I got:\n\n- 2x Haldiram large blocks of paneer (800g)\n- 1x Deep's small bag of kashmiri chili powder (200g)\n- 1x Deep's small bag of garam masala (200g)\n- 1x Haldiram family size bag of aloo paratha (1.6kg)\n\nLooking online, I am able to assemble many carts that beat this price. I would rather shop in person, but $60 for this cart is very unreasonable, especially considering there are many Indian students living nearby with few other options.\n\nI understand the high prices may not be the fault of this store, but the prices have gotten out of hand.\n\nStill, I love this store. Slightly overpriced but still a good spot with tons of Indian grocery options. Service in this store is very hit and miss. The owner is wonderful, but one of the young women behind the counter is so disrespectful as to make it a better choice to shop in one of the convenience stores nearby. Today after twice not having scratched solutions fields in a winning lottery ticket to her liking and being rudely told to do better, I decided that my dignity is not worth the shorter trip. One of the best parts about the area, sandwiches that are good and a normal size for $10! Such a good variety and still hase $1 arizona! Best place on Earth... I came all the way from Nashville Tennessee!!! To enjoy the hallowed Wollaston's Market... \ud83c\udf20\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udcafI got a sandwich at their excellent, world-class deli. It was called the George Likes His Chicken Spicy. They let me get it on an Asiago Bagel!!! Delicious! SMASH!!! and they had TAMARIND chips!? Weekee-whaa? xD Small Grocery Store + Deli\n\nGreat (cheap) breakfast sandwiches and wide selection of drinks, snacks, and (less cheap) groceries. I was amazed to finally find a vegetarian option at a cheap rate. Must try veggie delight sandwich for all the veg lovers We love this place! Their deli is amazing, so many options for breakfast and lunch, coffee is always fresh in the mornings and it's a great place to get some groceries. They have a small selection of pharmacy goods and beauty products. The staff is great! I can't say enough about them always friendly and very helpful. Beautiful campus and has great connectivity. The gym is open until midnight and so is the grocery store nearby. The library is open 24/7 and the RedEye helps you get back to your place safe and sound. Overall it\u2019s a delightful place to study. If you are someone like me, who wanted to consistently apply the knowledge that I gained inside the classroom, no one does applied learning better than Northeastern. Not only is NU the global leader in experiential education, its Co-op network is the largest on planet Earth. In fact, NU has Co-ops on all seven continents. NU\u2019s Co-op Program also happens to be one of the oldest at more than one hundred years old.\n\nAs an extremely proud alumnus who lives and works in New York City, I cannot recommend Northeastern University enough. In terms of the quality of educational experience, be it a vibrant urban college life; Co-ops; Student Research; international opportunities like Study Abroad, International Co-op, Dialogue of Civilizations, and Service Learning; or excellent career support, you cannot beat Northeastern. Even today, NU continues to support me throughout my career, socially, and intellectually through a variety of thoughtful online courses for NU Huskies and in-person alumni events in New York.\n\nIf you are looking for something beyond a traditional higher educational experience, attend Northeastern, the number one experiential university in the world. Before I dive more into how powerful and meaningful a Northeastern experiential education can be, let me say that Northeastern University is an amazing place and I truly loved my time there! NU offers something vastly different than a traditional college education. A Northeastern education is experiential, innovative, and dynamic.\n\nNortheastern offers its students unrivaled access to the world. Needless to say, when I attended NU, I acquired four different international experiences for a total of two years working and studying overseas before graduating college. I completed two six month Co-ops, one for a major financial firm in London and another for a multinational tech company in Paris. Also, during a yearlong study abroad at an English university, I was awarded Full Colours, for competing in rugby at the collegiate level. This was a huge honor! Further, I had an amazing opportunity to attend a tech conference in London where I was heavily involved with innovation working groups. Also, with both London and Paris as my home bases and launching pads to the rest of Europe, I got to go backpacking in England, Ireland, Wales, Italy, Germany, and Russia.\n\nBack in the U.S., I completed a six month Co-op for another multinational tech company in Oregon. Even though I was on Co-op, the firm sent me to tech meetings in five major cities, including Honolulu and New York City, where I was the main contact for tech vendors. The best university and the best education you get here. Northeastern have all feild of study and all departments of Graduate and Undergraduate and also post graduate studies available. Also COVID-19 precautions properly taken care by Northeastern.Also northeastern have great architectural beauty of building and huge campus. My University. Proud husky! It's one of the best colleges out there, not just because I'm currently a student. But because the staff, faculty, crowd and overall administration and management is world class. Greedy private institution. They only care about money coming in... International students, after investing so much in education in the U.S., deserve way better than this.

Kind, helpful and competent.  Opened a new account this Saturday morning and was happy to find a supportive experience. Many thanks to Katie and the team. Outstanding staff and service! City of Boston Credit Union locations are all excellent! This branch is absolutely gorgeous! I would not do my banking anywhere but CBCU! Great and professional staffs here. Everyone is so friendly and helps me a lot. I applied my auto loan and I was satisfied with the experience here. Friendly staff with plenty of parking out back for conviene. Great customer service Boston Shawerma is honestly one of my favorite spots. The food is super high quality and the prices are really reasonable. With any order, they give you a free Dasani water which is such a nice touch. The people there are so kind and welcoming every time I go in.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how generous the owner is. I saw a few delivery drivers come in to pick up orders, and the owner offered them food and drinks just out of kindness. You don\u2019t see that often. It\u2019s the kind of place that makes you feel good about supporting a local business. Great food, great people, great vibes. The Shawarma tastes great. But I don\u2019t have any service. The sauce smells like peanut. The price is higher than I expected. The staff is very sweet and friendly. Unfortunately, the shawarmas my friend and I got were bland and did not taste like shawarma meat. Similarly, the baklava was underwhelming \u2014 flavorless and lacking in pistachios and rose flavoring. what an insanely large portion and so much variety in food in one plate. solid flavors too, I wouldn\u2019t say the meat was incredible but it wasn\u2019t distractingly dry or anything. It\u2019s solid. it\u2019s like a time machine to when things were 5$, i think 20$ is worth it when you get a bit of everything and they aren\u2019t trying to pinch pennies on the size of a falafel or meat like cava Solid shawarma spot with generous protein. The food was served very quickly so this spot is perfect on the go too. The food is really flavorful too so I do think this is also very worth the price that you pay. Would highly recommend stopping by here to grab a quick meal! Had a nice lunch at Mamacita. The bowls were large portions so two people could split that and a side. Everything was fresh and unique including the pineapple salad and plantains. The horchata was really good. Comfortable seating. Mamacita Mexican Comida is undoubtedly one of the best places near Northeastern serving  burritos \ud83c\udf2f, rice bowls \ud83c\udf5c and a lot more mouthwatering food which is super tasty after their unique sauces...\n\nMy personal favourite has to be Mango Sauce which is a bit tangy and spicy but it's fun to make your food topped with it.\n\nTo vegetarians looking for a meal, go for a rice bowl which allows you to have beans, tofu or falafel alongside vegetables and rice( the final version in the photographs below).\n\nPro tip: Ask for the stamp to your loyalty card, to get the ninth meal  for free \ud83d\ude1b.\n\nA must try restaurant for vegetarians \ud83d\udcaf!\n\nWell, I believe there should be more options for vegetarians ( I know it's too much to ask for) other than that this place has become my go-to place for sure! \ud83d\ude01 I had one order that was good, and one that was not. :\nFOOD:\n2 Bowls\nProtein Choice Spicy Chicken Tinga\nSauce Choice (3 max) Chipotle Aioli\nSauce Choice (3 max) Tomatillo Chimichuri\nChicken was overall moist though I had a couple small dried out pieces.\nThey mistakenly gave me Pico instead of Tomatillo Chimichuri.\nHowever some of the pico I think was starting to turn because only the top tasted good. Still a good plate. Rice lightly seasoned, lovely, as was the  Chipotle Aioli.\nVerdict: GOOD.\n\nProtein Choice Grilled Steak (+$3.00)\nSauce Choice (3 max) Chipotle Aioli\nSauce Choice (3 max) Tomatillo Chimichuri\nToppings Addition (7 max) Guacamole\nToppings Addition (7 max) Fried Plantains\nToppings Addition (7 max) Pineapple Salsa\nToppings Addition (7 max) Black Bean\nToppings Addition (7 max) Refried Beans\nToppings Addition (7 max) Shredded Romain\nToppings Addition (7 max) Cucumber\nThe Guacamole was soo good.\nThe rice in this bowl was really not good. Greasy and flavorless, though it appeared to be seasoned and have peas in it and was brownish. It actually reminded me of the rice I got at a restaurant down the street on the same block that serves shwarma.\nThe steak was cut into tiny chunks, and most were tough and chewy. The few I had that were seasoned well were lovely and tender, so I don't know what happened there.\n\n1 x Fried Plantains: Verdict: Good. It is hard to mess up plantain. Nice and ripe, though they do have the nice tostones. I just didn't get any.\n\nVerdict: DON\"T GET THE GRILLED STEAK FOR YOUR BOWL. GO FOR THE OTHER BEEF OPTIONS.\n\nSERVICE:\nSo when I walked in to pick-up my order there were only 3 people at the front, who seemed exhausted, and the place was empty. They were serving one customer, but two people seemed to be focused on that. The other person was bagging chips for the chips and salsa I assume. This young woman with the chips said after I interjected and said hello and that was there to pick up my order that looked like it had been bagged up already and less than 3 feet away from me, \"If she doesn't want to wait, I', not going to give it to her.\" She was speaking to her coworkers. I assumed she was speaking about me, as I was in a hurry, and I was right because when I unpacked the bag not complimentary chips or salsa was present. I wasn't rude, but she was clearly done, so I just chock it up to my impatience.\n\nVerdict: OKAY. This restaurant is a hidden gem! I ordered takeout so can\u2019t comment on the facilities but let me tell you about the food. Latina here. This place is way better in terms of taste and quality of Mexican food than many of the restaurants in the area and the fact that they have very reasonable pricing makes it even better. Give it a try! No fuss eatery with a good selection of combinations for rice bowls, tacos, quesadillas and burritos. Really vibrant and fun atmosphere. Food is more functional than authentic but overall a good spot for a quick bite. Believe it or not, it\u2019s my first time to eat in Five Guys, after seeing their stores so many times. I ordered the ALL BEEF HOT DOG, expecting beef inside\u2026 It turns out I was too naive: there was only a sausage. The good thing is that it tastes pretty nice as a hot dog. I think I will come back again, especially for a simple workday meal. For lunch today I was craving a BLT  and wanted a hot dog and Five Guys fresh cut fries with the skin on them are delicious!!!! BLT with Pickle \u2022 Ketchup \u2022 Mustard and mayo. The Bacon was cooked crispy they use apple-wood smoked it\u2019s has a great taste! Fresh lettuce & tomatoes sesame seed bun toasted!  It was delicious a must try if you haven\u2019t! Fries crispy season perfectly and cooked in peanut oil! I ordered a small but they dump so many in the bag you will be full after you get your moneys worth! The All-beef hot dog, split and grilled lengthwise for a caramelized exterior and American cheese got grilled onions pickles and mustard on the dog! The all beef hot god is delicious they melted cheese and grilled onions are a great combo! This spot is hitting on all cylinders food cooked properly, fresh ingredients and taste was excellent! Will be back again! Workers were extremely friendly and gave me a whole new order when grub hub delivered the wrong one. He made sure my order was made correctly and apologized even though it was grub hubs fault. This dude was so professional and knowledgeable about the menu. It was like going to Disney world of Five Guys. He deserves a raise and yes I left him a tip. Great culture and great burgers at this location. I\u2019d love to give the Five Guys some high fives.\n\nSuper tasty burgers and fries. In my opinion one of the tastiest chain restaurant burgers. Typically order the cheeseburger \u201call the way\u201d\u2014with a bunch of toppings (all of which are complimentary)\u2014and a small fries. The fries orders correspond to different cup sizes, but they always overflow the cup size you ask for (see photos of greasy goodness below).\n\nThe biggest drawback is the price\u2014$14.95 for a cheeseburger and fries is steep for fast food. Queue formed as those who ordered for collection were given priority. Had to wait exceptionally long. Food was as expected. We are visitors to Boston from Canada. My two friends and I went for the something to eat. The friend made an order and the manager gave the wrong order. My friend asked to give the correct order. Manager was so rude and insisted that my friend gave the wrong order and refused to exchange but asked for money  for a new order. He just went to the back and played on his phone.\nThe table was unstable and the tea cup tipped over the table.  The staff s did not help clean the tea.\nPoor customer service. Great coffee, great donuts, excellent staff and awesome atmosphere. Was able to relax and enjoy my coffee. Asked for less ice and got half-empty cup A nice Dunkin with 4-5 tables for seating. recently visited Wings Over and was impressed by their offerings. We ordered the Crispy Chicken Wrap, which was delicious\u2014especially with extra BBQ sauce and blue cheese added for extra flavor. The 10 Classic BBQ Wings were good, though I wish they had been a tad crispier. Overall, a satisfying meal that I\u2019d recommend to wing enthusiasts. Wings Over Boston is a nearby branch of the chain located throughout the Boston area, with this location being located down the street from Longwood and the Northeastern Area.\n\nThe staff are friendly and pump out orders quite quickly, especially during times when it might be rushed due to the proximity of college students and delivery drivers. Staff give accurate times for food ordering and ensure food is delivered fresh and correctly.\n\nThe tenders are alright, a bit overfried to the point where it can be a little dry, but the sauce and seasonings are helpful to supplement this. The garlic parm didn't have much of the garlic taste as other locations, but it was pretty good. We also tried the hot garlic which did have a more pronounced garlic taste, and was pretty good. The food is good the people are friendly the food can take any where between 16-20 minutes depending on what you order. I ordered lemon pepper and sweet chili wings the 10 pack. The food is high quality,but this early morning was the worse of many service experiences I\u2019ve ever received at this location  The language used at work should always be professional and at least slightly attentive or pleasant.  The portly, slightly handsome 5\u201910 gentleman csr/cashier needs better management training about saying hello on the phone when greeting your customer$ and using proper language in business!! The whole crew may have been hi, but at least pay attention, I stood at the counter without assistance for about 120 seconds without a greeting! I ordered 6 hot lemon pepper flavored chicken wings combo. The wings are very flavorful. The fries are no flavor and dry. Just found a ROCK in my burrito while eating it \u2014 some sort of hard chunk of unidentified material, about the size and shape of a pebble. Maybe a chunk of beef bone? But I ordered chicken. I spit it out and brought it to the counter, but the staff seemed pretty apathetic about it. It gets the second star because this has always been one of my favorite places\u2026 but foreign matter that could crack my teeth while eating tends to put a damper on things. Literally the best place for this kind of food! I love it I eat here religiously with my co-workers and I always get the same thing and it\u2019s always so great it\u2019s like eating it for the very first time all over. I can\u2019t put into words how good this place is you just need to come to this location whenever you can! Thank you The quesadilla rolled up is the way to go, and their hot sauce is quite good. Dudes / Ladies behind the counter are awesome and they have free fries on Fridays if you ask. Easily top-tier low-interaction drunk food. It took 45 minutes to make my quesadilla and I saw 40 people get their orders before I got mine. Then some cross eyed guy dropped my quesadilla on the ground and proceeded to laugh when he handed it to me. When I finally took a bite of my quesadilla there was no cheese in it so I wouldn\u2019t even call it a quesadilla. I\u2019ve never been more disappointed in my life and recommend no one goes to this location. That cross eyed guy needs to be fired! On a more positive note, the Anna\u2019s in Brookline is phenomenal I recommend everyone take their business there and not to the Huntington ave location. This small eatery is set up similarly to the Chipotle franchise. But the prices are much better and the food quality and taste is excellent. The only drawback for someone from California or Texas, there is literally no heat in any of their salsas. Lol. this location is the biggest i\u2019ve seen yet. parking is decent. it\u2019s on the street. there\u2019s easy access to public transportation. where we parked it was right around the corner. we ordered online and paid about $30 for a chicken wrap, two fries a milkshake and lemonade. you can also order inside on their kiosk. it was fresh, flavorful and easy on my stomach. especially the vanilla milkshake. it had a vanilla bean taste to it and was creamy. it definitely satisfied my milkshake craving. you can tell it\u2019s good quality. i love that they find the best clean option to consume. their ketchup is even better then what we\u2019re used to tasting. i wish their burgers came with fries. their lemonade flavors that always change are very tasty and you have so many options. the employees were also pretty cool. Excellent vegetarian food choices. Good quality and freshly made. This location is in a Northeastern University activity center and was quite packed at lunchtime during the school day. Otherwise, I'm very glad we stopped.  Nice coffee shop nearby too. This is a great spot for students and staff around the Northeastern campus to grab lunch on the go or dine it. The food is always fresh and both sweet potato real fries are amazing. Great place for Vegan and veggie options at Northeastern. This outlet is located within the Marino Recreational center premises on Huntington Avenue. The place is well lit and the decor is simple yet intuitive. The burger with the veggie patty option was quite fulfilling both in terms of quality and quantity. I\u2019d recommend this place any day. Really disappointed in this food. I spent over $25 for a basically inedible lunch. They forgot both of the extra sauces that I paid for, the sandwich is a soggy, sad, mess. It seriously looks like someone just smashed it in the bag. This was a first and last visit. The gentleman that gave me my food was really great and nice though.\nI just wish the food was worth the price. Now, I'm out $25, and still hungry, and can't afford to go anywhere else. Panera Bread \ud83c\udf5e is one of the franchises that I like and I was looking for a quick dinner \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f and somewhere with seating immediately available.\nLike other Panera Bread restaurants I have visited, service was good, the place was clean and the food was good. This Panera Bread has \ud83e\ude91 seating available downstairs. Downstairs does look a little bit like it is being or has been used for storage.\nI had the half Ciabatta Cheesesteak and Bistro French Onion \ud83e\uddc5 Soup \ud83c\udf72 for dinner and the Passion Papaya Iced Green Tea for my drink. The wait time was short. You can order from tablets that are at the front counter. WiFi available. Get the app for deals and rewards.\nYou may encounter homeless people asking for $ near the front door. Every city \ud83c\udf06 has this issue.\nI recommend this Panera Bread. This place is terrible! Rude staff, slow and sloppy service. We were dining in. There\u2019s food stuck on the silverware they placed next to my food. When I asked for a fresh one, the staff working in the kitchen was rude and amazingly he couldn\u2019t even find a clean one from the bin he was searching through and ended up handing me a plastic one without apologizing at all. This is not all! The chicken salad barely had any chicken in it. Never again! Chilled atmosphere in a good location. Upstairs and downstairs for seating, although not many tables for 1 if it's crowded and you want to be alone for work. Great for study buddies or groups.\n\nPanera is my go-to chain cafe when I want more than just a coffee, although Sip Club makes going here over Starbucks more cost friendly. Great Baja Mac & cheese. I really liked it. The food is expensive for the quantity that they provide. I ordered a pick 2 combo of Baja Mac & cheese along with a Mediterranean veggie half sandwich. Order usually takes more time than at other comparable places. First visit to Panera bread and I did walk out impressed even though I\u2019ve pointed out some shortcomings. Look what they put in my sandwich \u2026 I should sue to be honest. ITS COMPLETELY ROTTEN! As if they found it sitting in the corner of the floor, and they just slapped it on my sandwich!!!!! recently visited Wings Over and was impressed by their offerings.

The young lady behind the counter gave SIGNIFICANTLY LESS amount of fish for my sushi burrito than it should be. Literally witnessed her giving three FULL scoops of fish for the guy before me. I order the same thing every time at this place and usually the ones made by the older lady have really good portion. Also the man (probably the owner) of this place was INCREDIBLY MEAN to me when I asked if I can substitute ingredients for my order. Feel like this place doesn\u2019t worth coming anymore Recently got a delivery order from GH. I got their make your own bowls and a side of takoyaki, Korean fried chicken, and the Taiwanese pork rice. Both poke bowls were good, but my favorite was actually the Taiwanese pork rice. Tender pork pieces with the soy glaze were perfect toppings for the rice, and the extra sauce enriched the overall flavors. The sauce used for the Korean spicy wings wasn\u2019t authentic, but the wings were still great.\nAlthough this place is right next to a college campus, the prices weren\u2019t very cheap. They were still quite generous with the portions, and I would probably get another delivery order in the future. Best poke bowls ever! I go here nearly every week for a reason- the food is delicious, service is quick, and prices are reasonable. They are generous with toppings, and the staff is always kind and fast. Great place for on the go food or take out. I recommend the Ahi Tuna Poke! Incredibly worth it. Compared to other Poke spots, they have lots of free extra toppings such as grilled zukini, crab sticks and etc This burrito is like a big fat uncut sushi roll with a hint of salad amazing huge portions for your price!!! Perfect perfectly perfect!!!!! Also got a make your own bowl but ate half before I could take a good picture so that should explain that! Yum!!! This was my first time in today. I had never had this before and I wanted to try something new. My cashier was amazing very kind and understanding. At The Mango berry bowl it was very good. Everything was made with love and care , I have social anxiety so every time I buy food outside I always leave, but I felt very comfortable so I decided to dine in the area was very clean no dirt the bathroom was clean as well. I\u2019m very glad I chose this place to eat today I will definitely be back thank you for you\u2019re such an amazing experience. This place made me so happy. Omw to the Y I decided to check this place out. Super cute. Atmosphere is on 1000. The staff is so welcoming and friendly. You have to try Playa Bowl Lovely cafe for breakfast or just to enjoy a healthy meal! Super refreshing bowls and all the menu is vegetarian and vegan friendly. Great service and friendly staff. Would love if they also serve coffee that would be the perfect meal for me!\nThe menu has unlimited options of bowls so I will have to be back to try more options! on the pricey side (11-13$), but amazing acai, pitaya, and mango bowls!! my personal fav is the \"electric mermaid\" for the wide variety of fruit, and occasionally ill get half acai, half pitaya! good amount of fruit and high quality, the granola also is nut free if you have allergies!! (would not buy the oatmeal though for that price that's overpriced) if you come often, it's so worth it to sign up for their free loyalty program and u can get a discount based on your points (also the first day of the month you get double)! it's always best if you can make ur own price wise, but otherwise i'd def recommend! i love this plzce so much. all the workers are so nice and the food is affordable and yummy and filling! thank you guys! would def reccomend. im actually here today again. see you soon! Beautiful restaurant, made a reservation but didn\u2019t need it that night. The food was all great. Truffle fries is where it\u2019s at! Pro tip, if someone orders Alfredo, dip the fries in the Alfredo sauce, new level of delicious unlocked. Needed a last minute reservation for Friday, and the manager Jeff answered. I can not say enough good things about him. I explained the desire for a quiet area if one existed, maybe something scenic too and he had just the place in mind and reserved for me. I arrived and was seated and he came over to introduce himself and see if things were to my liking and offer any and all assistance if needed. You could tell he really cared about our experience, especially when my date arrived. He continued to go above and beyond to ensure we were happy. I dont think I have ever been treated so well in any dining experience in my life, especially in my first time somwhere. His staff was attentive and everything went amazing. The food was delicious. We felt at home and spent almost all night at our table, they never rushed us out, they made sure we knew we were welcome to stay and how happy they were to have us. 10/10 experience, will definitely return. We are from out of town and like coming here to eat when visiting Boston\nWe have been here 3 or 4 times for lunch and have always been pleased either the food and service.\nWe had Connor for our server and he was very good!\nWe had group of 6 and all tried different dishes and were all very happy with our choices.\nWill definitely come back on our next trip to visit our son, he lives right down street from Westland so very convenient and we love how laid back and classy The Westland is!! Disappointing. We decided to dine here due to some good reviews. Our first time here. My cocktail was very sweet with no other flavor but SWEET.  The waitress said the bartender was new. Our artichoke dip was a gummy mess with soggy pita chips. Not sure if we ever tasted any artichokes. My husband's chicken piccata came out cold and very bland. My Cesar salad was drenched in dressing and all you could taste was the dressing. Our waitress was good, knowledgable, even though she forgot my ginger ale. We left most of our meal and will not return again. There were about 6 or 7 of us.  Probably 50% of our party was late.  The team there did their best to handle our tardiness. I appreciate their flexibility. Everyone said they enjoyed their food. Orders ranged from fish and chips to Bolognese. The decor of the restaurant was quite nice.  Great romantic restaurant. I would eat there again. Unfortunately, the photos before you feature chicken that has been CHEWED and SPIT OUT into a sort of mash, due to the inedibility of the meal.. I received no refund for this culinary disaster.\n\nUnbelievably dry and tough tenders solely acting as perfectly odd vessels to suck/chew the buffalo sauce off of. These were more akin to a stick of gum than any cut of meat. By all means necessary, DO NOT expect any pleasantries, other than the flavor of its coating. Slices bigger than my face. Hot, delicious and definitely filling. Buffalo chicken and pepperoni were both delish. We stopped for lunch after walking around Berklee and the pizza was amazing! My husband and I and our two kids shared a large pepperoni pizza and it was delicious with crispy crust. It definitely hit the spot! It was some of the best pizza I've had. And this was the only time my 4 year old son has wanted to eat the pepperoni on his pizza! \ud83d\ude06 The staff was so friendly and very kind to our kids and they made the whole lunch experience great for us tourists! We will definitely be going back the next time we're in Boston. Thank you Cappy's staff! Ordered a burger online that is supposed to come with jalape\u00f1os, Swiss cheese onion rings and bacon, added lettuce and pickles then proceeded to get only those? Why advertise a rodeo burger then not give any of the toppings that go with it? Also 30$ for three items, a subpar burger, about 50 fries and a drink is absurd. Low quality food and clearly workers who can\u2019t pay attention to details about a simple order. The pizzas are outstanding and the base is softer as well as cheesier, you may find the service one of the best on Boston. They also maintain good hygiene so it may be all time go to store in Boston to have pizza and other products. \ud83c\udf55\ud83c\udf55 One of the coffe shops on the list while visiting Boston and it did not disappoint! Came here for a quick coffee and lox before heading to Salem, and it was delicious. I forgot what kind of coffee I got, but it was one of their Fall flavors but it was very yummy. Would go here again next time I visit Boston. Pavement is a good place to get some fresh coffee and some pastries. The coffee have a great taste I got an Americano with cream, was very hot! And I got a sesame seed bagel with egg and cheese , was very good! .\nThe ambience was good, clean but small space and busy in the morning.\nIs an option better than Starbucks! For a first time experience, not thrilled by the service or the quality of their food. Ordered ahead and it took roughly 20 minutes to make the order(quiet Saturday morning).\n\nBagel was clearly burnt however the lack of attention to detail is clearly not something the staff are looking for here. Service and atmosphere is that of an airport Dunkin Donuts.\n\nYou\u2019d think if you\u2019re going to spend money on some decent food you\u2019d get a hello and a smile along with it. As a business owner, I\u2019m sad a place like this has so much potential and isn\u2019t using it considering its location and market. I\u2019ll stick with The Bittersweet Shoppe across the street! Take notes management. I recently visited this cafe and found it to be a mixed experience. The price for an iced mocha oat milk latte was quite high at $7.50, which felt excessive. The drink itself was a bit disappointing\u2014too much chocolate made it taste more like a chocolate smoothie rather than a balanced mocha latte. While the drink wasn\u2019t terrible, I expected better for nearly $8.\n\nOn a positive note, the cafe has a charming rustic ambiance and offers a cozy coffeehouse experience. The staff were also friendly and helpful. Overall, while the atmosphere and service were commendable, the drink and its price left something to be desired. I simply loved their bagels and I liked that they offered an original Coca Cola in a glass bottle. The coffee was also good and they made the food rather quickly. The reason for the poor grade, however, was the staff. They were much more interested in talking to each other than to serve their customers. One of the staff ate his lunch in the same area as they made the food and served customers with food in his mouth. The general attitude of the staff was a bit arrogant and somewhat rude. Being used to excellent service in and around Boston (I am visiting from time to time) the whole experience was a bit of a let down. I hope the establishment could coach their staff a bit better to enhance the experience of being a customer here. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Highly Recommend!\n\nTried this bubble tea spot on Newbury Street, and it did not disappoint! The place itself is small but super cute, perfect for a quick stop while strolling around. One thing to note\u2014they open at 11 AM, but when we went right at opening, the store wasn\u2019t quite ready until 11:30 AM. So, if you\u2019re planning to go early, maybe give it a little extra time to get the boba toppings to get ready.\n\nWe ordered a tea without the boba toppings, and honestly, it was amazing on its own! The flavors were perfectly balanced, not too sweet, and super refreshing. If you\u2019re a bubble tea lover (or even if you\u2019re not), definitely worth checking out. Will be back for sure! While I enjoyed Gong Cha's pearl milk tea, I was a little disappointed that the pearls were smaller than expected and not as chewy as I prefer. Gong Cha Newbury is the Newbury Street Franchise of the globally popular Gong Cha boba shops.\n\nOne feature that stands out is they sell bubble waffles with or without ice cream at this location, though it does tend to get on the more expensive side. They also have a deal to sell instant ramen, which I find a bit weird (ramen and boba?) but it doesn't bother me.\n\nThe boba is pretty standard with other locations, nothing that makes it different from other locations. The bubble waffles are good, though takes a long time to make. Ice cream is good as well. Not the best, pearls were soft and not chewy, had run out of red velvet powder couldn\u2019t get my hot drink but they did everything else comes hot also, so I picked one - which is made a a slushy and so didn\u2019t come hot - so I gave up on the hot\u2026. I used to love this place, but I was disappointed on my last visit. They used to have caffeine free milk flavor, but they don't anymore. There wasn't any Taro in stock. The mango flavor didn't taste like mango and tasted like brown tea."

    "reviews": "Loved this place, the artist I worked with really took their time when shaping the nails.  The total cost of the nails was $67.00, I got acrylic and gel on top. Will definitely come here again! I always go to Terry to get my nails done for acrylics/gel and dip. She is really consistent, doesn\u2019t sacrifice the quality of your nails, and puts in the time even when it\u2019s busy. I\u2019ve seen her 4 times so far, but I\u2019m moving soon so I\u2019m sad to have to find a new nail tech. I couldn\u2019t recommend her enough! Great at communication and really nice. Tina worked really diligently on my nails (they were in a terrible way from a previous salon), she didn\u2019t rush and made sure they looked as I wanted them when I left. Took the photos at home on day 3 I'm in town for medical stuff and needed my nails done. This place was close to my rental with good reviews. I'll add to those good reviews. The place is comfortable and Nun did a lovely job on my gel manicure and was incredibly kind. I'll definitely return when I'm in the area. Got a very basic gel manicure from Amenda and it was great! Little pricey (39$) but that\u2019s to be expected in Boston. Had multiple people recommend this place and it was worth it\u2014will be back in the future! One of the best parts about the area, sandwiches that are good and a normal size for $10! Such a good variety and still hase $1 arizona! Best place on Earth... I came all the way from Nashville Tennessee!!! To enjoy the hallowed Wollaston's Market... \ud83c\udf20\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udcafI got a sandwich at their excellent, world-class deli. It was called the George Likes His Chicken Spicy. They let me get it on an Asiago Bagel!!! Delicious! SMASH!!! and they had TAMARIND chips!? Weekee-whaa? xD Small Grocery Store + Deli\n\nGreat (cheap) breakfast sandwiches and wide selection of drinks, snacks, and (less cheap) groceries. I was amazed to finally find a vegetarian option at a cheap rate. Must try veggie delight sandwich for all the veg lovers We love this place! Their deli is amazing, so many options for breakfast and lunch, coffee is always fresh in the mornings and it's a great place to get some groceries. They have a small selection of pharmacy goods and beauty products. The staff is great! I can't say enough about them always friendly and very helpful. New concept food court with cool vibe almost like a club,  high ceiling, clean seating area. Bar at the center and booths offering different cuisines, it's a huge airy space but cozy feel at the same time- an interesting venue. Went on a Tuesday late afternoon and was not crowded.\nFoodwise nothing noteworthy except for Ms.Clucks deluxe chicken and dumplings.\n-First tried cheezy ramen $17\n48 hour bone and smokey gouda broth topped with karaake fried chicken nuggets. Was surprised how good karaake chicken was! Ramen was perfect with authentic Japanese karaake and was so tender, fried perfect. Was the best ever tried in Boston. Ended up going back to order side of karaake nuggets $6. Broth however was actually too salty for my liking,\n-Signature spicy chicken & dumplings ramen $17\nRamen topped with spicy ground chicken, truffled chicken wonton. Noodle was also good but broth had somewhat gamey smell.\n\n-From Inchu asian-inspired bowls, tried vietnamese banh mi bowl $15.75 with choice of bbq chicken for protein and Jasmine rice for base. As their name suggests, it is an 'inspired' bowl of rice with veges and bahn mi aioli sauce, and not authentic, but ample portion. Pickled radish just didn't go well..\n\n-From PRB Boulangerie, tried Breakfast croissant $10 they warmed it up and it was too chewy and disappointing.\n\nWe liked the market and probably would come back if in the area. Really good food and wide variety. Not as many options as other time out locations but still lovely. Visiting from the UK, this was on the must visit list, and the bonus was a Saturday afternoon of drag queens hosting bingo. Had great cocktails and ticked off a lobster roll on my Boston eats list. Great place. Would need more atmosphere, but great food. Completed all my Time Out Markets\u2019 visits around the world\u2026 probably the most boring (during lunch, on a Wednesday, in January). But it\u2019s worth the visit. Stopped in on a Tuesday afternoon, and it was somewhat busy. Plenty of variety for food - Asian, Mexican, pizza, crepes, chicken, seafood, and more.\n\nIndoors - nice shelter from the cold wind.\n\nVery clean and plenty of seating.\n\nEnjoyed pepperoni pizza ($16), nori/sushi tacos, birria taco ($6), and lobster roll ($32).\n\nWould recommend for a casual meal with diverse food options.

Student recitals in Berklee are sometimes wonderful evening experience in Boston, highly recommended. The education might be fine. But Some of the security guy or gate men there were rude and arrogant. They\u2019re not the boss but try to be.  \ud83e\udd2e You all need to recognize Kylee Jefferson as a notable alumni who is the main character on Tiny Pretty Things. Top ballet  and  modern dancers to revel those professionals on tv. A must see event while in  Boston Great music school They have Broadway \ud83c\udfad quality shows .  They have a parking garage within walking distance .  They have snacks for sale on a cart along with alcoholic beverages.  This place is immaculate on the cleanliness level , Including the bathrooms. Outside of the establishment they have many restaurants.  The show we saw was spectacular \u201c stand up if your here tonight \u201c.  The prices are great for the quality .\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc The staff are very accommodating. The ballet dancers were phenomenal. I am looking forward to seeing scream Queens. Great little theate. Parking garages within 5 minutes on foot.  Decent prices. The \"bar\" was more of a cart with cans they will open for you for 10-15 dollars. Multiple food options across the street including chains like panera dunkin and five guys. The bathrooms were downstairs and extremely clean. Plenty of staff and volunteers guiding people in and to their seats. Definitely a place I would go again. This is a great theater. Small enough that most every seat offers a great view. Awesome professional performances. Beautiful show. Wish it was longer. Dancers were amazing! I picked up a pizza today and it was coverd in mold! The place has opend food boxes and contents stolen from them. Great selection of convenience store items.  The staff and owners are the best people. Friendly and helpful Staff, it says on here that it opens at 8am , I went there at 8:20 this morning and it wasn\u2019t open and there wasn\u2019t anyone in sight, someone should really make the change clearly This store is owned by a lovely, hardworking couple who most know on a first name basis in our community. Andy & Anna and their staff are also friendly and happy to help . Their store is convient, clean and has a bit of everything. I have never had a bad experience there . Even during Covid when stock was low they did all they could to to get what their customers needed and always do so. We are very lucky to have them in our community. bought a soda and charged me $6.8 without receipt\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44$6.8? how is it possible???I can buy almost a dozen with 6.8 dollar. I will never buy anything from this store Incredible bar with great food. Went here for Super Bowl 59 and what an amazing experience. Been there twice now and will certainly be revisiting and hopefully soon! Food was okay and so were the beers. Fair priced. Kind of loud so hard to talk but still fun. History of notice is very important about the international view past the opportunity of notice revolt from free e- cigarettes to be wrong from the people that take off notice secure doing a stubborn from me allergies smell of flu mixed up with first of compared from the international lazy to guard secure view impossible about I gave up with notice to stop by e-cigarettes not good enough. Other very delicious food and not especially German beers very damned. Not expensive about Very  cheap food, very fed up WOW that's the first of 2025! I recently visited Houston Hall for happy hour, and it was a fantastic experience! The manager Ivan is fantastic - he is very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is amazing, with a massive beer hall and brew pub vibe located in New York City's historic West Village.\n\nI ordered my go-to classic, a Moscow Mule, which was perfectly crafted. The highlight of my visit, though, was the Big Plate Nachos. They came loaded with three-bean chili, grilled mixed veggies, a secret spice combo, and melted Jack & cheddar. The tortillas were fried in-house, making the nachos super delicious. Although the vegan chili was super yummy, I opted for meat on mine, and it did not disappoint.\n\nHouston Hall's happy hour runs from Tuesday to Friday, 4 pm to 8 pm, and all day Sunday. With an exclusive selection of craft beers, specialty cocktails, and homemade tavern fare, it's the perfect spot to unwind and enjoy some great food and drinks. Highly recommend! A huge bar located in the West Village, in NYC. We've been there went some friends to watch the Super Bowl. The place was very crowded, and the tables were shared. Even though, service was good enough - the good came quick and warm enough. The empanadas were delicious - we've tried the cheese ones. The sound was disappointing: we barely could hear the game. Anyway, a funny place to go! Excellent recital hall at Berklee . Superb acoustics and lighting Great venue. Great jazz show. Saw saw a very nice production of Cosi Fan Tuti add Boston Conservatory Theater. We have been to many productions there and are never disappointed. Yet another place I didn't know existed!  I feel ripped off by not knowing this one was here.\nWent there Sunday for \"Into the Woods\" a musical performance put on by the students of the Boston Conservatory College.\nIt was amazing.\nThe theater itself is small , quaint and has great acoustics.\nEvery seat was amazing and close to the stage.\nA must see! Tonight we saw a Studio Recital on the 4th floor. Amazing students. Great performance.  I wished we lived here so we could hear performances like this more often. Fabulous performance of City of Angel's.\nFelt like I was on Broadway!\nMusic, excellent.\nVoices, excellent\nCostumes, excellent\nDiction, excellent\nLighting & props, excellent Terrific small theater, location, where I enjoyed a great performance of Rent with local friends insecond row, center. Outbreak of COVID among cast announced the next day. Glad I never took my N99 mask off. Looking forward to future visits. Went to a subscription concert here. Best music I have ever heard. Awesome acoustics. But I reached about seven minutes late and they did not let me in until intermission. Had to miss dear friend\u2019s performance. But other than that I had fun. One of the best concert halls in the states. Not too big, but the acoustic on the stage or in the audience are incredible. Not to mention the historical interior! Wonderful theatre to see a show or concert in. The stage is beautiful and the acoustics are great. The curved seating area and balcony provide a great view no matter where your seat is and there are no pillars or other obstructions to worry about. We\u2019ve seen a play, a musical, and a BEMF concert there and all of them were excellent.\n\nOutside of the theater itself, the space is well designed for getting everyone in the door and to their seats. There are ample bathrooms that are clean. There is a convenient parking garage right next door as well as easy drop of by taxi/uber/lyft. Gorgeous hall with marvelous acoustics, but sit in the middle because the sides slant. Excellent Hall with a great acoustic. We were at the violin performance by Midory, a Celebrity Series Boston performance. The Hall is perfect for this. You can see and hear from almost everywhere. The best dorm coz my daughter is there. They have a nice big elevator. Security is tight. U need your student ID to enter both the main door and the roo. (with additional code). Rooms were small but my daughter and her roommate has a quad w 2 people. Oh, NO air conditioning!!! What? So OG. Dined at BC Dining Commons today ; was very good ! Had burgers and salads , all good , staff were very nice ! Very difficult place to find and no parking We couldn't be happier with our experience working with Ellen. From the very first call to the final steps of buying our first home, she was always available with a smile, ready to answer every question we had. We highly recommend her to anyone looking to buy a home! Ellen Dudley is a one of a kind realtor! I can't say enough positive things about her. First and foremost she is trustworthy. I have worked with other realtors before and it is clear that they are just in the business to make money and that they don't really care about finding the right home for you. That is not Ellen! Ellen will go over and beyond to ensure that her clients are happy. She understands that purchasing a home is the biggest investment most people make during their lifetime. When working with her I found her to be very responsive, patient, an excellent listener, and very creative when it comes to how to get a deal accepted in this very competitive housing market. I always felt like I was a priority. When looking at houses she is very attentive and gives you her honest feedback. If you work with Ellen it will be one of the best decisions you will make and you will be in good hands. I really can't imagine having a better experience with a real estate broker than we have had with Ellen Dudley.  We have been very grateful for her many efforts, over three tenants, to market the home we rent out in Wellesley. She is there for every showing and , because she is warm, caring, and well-informed, she ends up endearing herself to our potential  tenants (and she gets us the very best ones.)  We get excellent feedback on the showings.  Further, Ellen took on a particularly challenging listing for an elderly woman I care for.  Ellen moved mountains to get this woman the very highest possible price, helping her retirement fund considerably.  So she's brainy, hard-working, savvy, kind and so enjoyable to be around. Do yourself a favor.  Give Ellen a call.  She'll work hard for you. We had an amazingly smooth and enjoyable experience with Ellen. Her attention to detail and her willingness to go the extra mile was something I have never experienced in my previous Real Estate transactions.  She kept us posted and on tract during the entire process, also Ellen is so up to date with the current market and worked hard to make sure we got the best possible price for our property. I will recommend her to anyone who is looking to buy or sell. I'm an 80-year-old pack rat who lived for 11 years in the condo I wanted to sell. Ellen brought in her team, including an Organizer and a handy-man.\nThey helped me miraculously transform my cluttered condo into a spotless dwelling in just a few weeks,\nWe had two Open Houses the weekend after Thanksgiving, got two offers, and my condo was in-contract the next week.\nEllen continued her expert support, guiding me over the hurdles that always occur before closing.\nThroughout Ellen demonstrated both professionalism as well as genuine caring. Great venue. Great jazz show. The guy with the glasses i think he\u2019s the supervisor, is rude and very unpleasant. Super slow and shouldn\u2019t be the face of that specific store lacks customer service , Never thanks you , never says anything but when you complain he mumbles under his breathe what a joke. i want to say he\u2019s asian with glasses trying to describe the best i can Rude worker(s) - I made a mobile order ahead of time as one does but when I got there I only received my drink and I waited because I felt pitty for them since they had a lot of orders. However, after 15 minutes I inquired about my order and was promptly ignored. I kept pushing and was finally told that she \"just placed my order there\" WHAT? and then rolled her eyes and walked away. I left then because no one was helping me and I was the only person that was given attitude. I never had an issue like from Dunkin so I was hurt but I will be filing a complaint. The last two times I've gone I waited 30 minutes for a bacon egg and cheese. The first time they forgot to make it and when they did make it, it was on the wrong bagel. This time after 30 minutes I just gave my receipt to another person waiting in line and left because I had to get to class. Both times I was no later than the fifth person in line. The line moves fast enough, you just wait forever to get your food. Only go here if you have half an hour to kill with nothing time sensitive to follow. Whoever manages this location needs to hire more people. The staff is swamped with online orders and the past two times I went I had to wait +20 minutes just to order (and was never more than 3 deep in line).  It's not the staff's fault, they're nice and just doing their best with the mountain of online orders they're getting. It's ok they're very slow, which can be mostly excused because they get very busy,but they're still slow when there aren't many people. Worst of all is some employees (not all, some are great) don't read the order number and just put orders down so either the whole crowd has to individually check or they won't know if their order is there Today I went there for my half hour break for lunch. The Cashier and other employees barely spoke English. So when I paid with Apple Pay, an error occurred on Subways end but money was taken out of my account. Still the Cashier double charged me for a large Cheesey Garlic Steak and cheese 13.99 the first time and then 16.69 the second time and both times the money came out of my account. Because the employee one spoke barely any English, two had no troubleshooting skills to see what was wrong with the system and  people skills she immediately kept telling me \u201cYou Won\u2019t pay, You won\u2019t Pay\u201d loudly and aggressively like I\u2019m trying to rob her. Even though I kept asking her to speak to a manager or someone she literally refused and told me I can\u2019t, and that I am refusing to pay despite that I showed her my digital receipts. I even showed her the amount in my account during the beginning of the transaction and then the money coming out during the tap and pay transaction. She was treating like some sort of sandwich thief even though she robbed me by charging me twice and putting two different prices!\n\nIn the end finally a separate coworker called the manager. The manager on speaker phone said he could see on his system my order and he finally got them to give me my sandwich and I had only 3 mins  to spare from my half hour lunch break. I also wasn\u2019t fully assured I\u2019d get a refund for the second charge, he just said \u201cwell it should happen at some point\u201d\n\nSo terrible service, if you have Apple Pay don\u2019t do it. They should put one team member in that has some proficient level of English or knowledge of their order system. Or maybe they shouldn\u2019t refuse for 20 mins to let you speak to a manager? A nice subway outlet located at Ryder Hall within the Northeastern University campus in Boston. The attendants who work at this outlet do not have English proficiency and they make your life real difficult when you ask them something or ask them to repeat or clarify. I also had to bear their brunt because of their ignorance. They kept speaking in Spanish in between themselves while I was trying to order and I am certain that it had to do something with me. Go here only if you have ample amount of time and patience with you. The service is decent but good luck with asking for options. Be ready for poker faced expressions all the while. Kevin. Racially profiled me, let all the white customers ahead and didn\u2019t mention their food to the cashier the moment I came he\u2019s yelling my order as if I was lying. I asked to meet with the manger and was met by Sandra very nice lady. He then came from\nBehind the area asking what my problem is . I said she\u2019ll talk to you after I leave. He said \u201cwhat you gonna do about it\u201d threatening manner then called me a Karen. He then argued with the supervisor and continued to speak Spanish about me as if I couldn\u2019t understand. He needs to be fired !! easily the *worst* subway I've ever been to, horrible service and food not fresh. I did not even start to begin my order and the workers (MULTIPLE TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED) will start putting random stuff on your sandwich. I asked for lettuce, she started putting honey mustard on top of just the meats. What even??? Do not go here at all costs, unless you're looking for someone to get your order wrong and you'll end up eating a sandwich you didn't even ask for. Absolute dog water. This is probably the worst restaurant I have ever been to. They have never gotten my order right (after 5 tries now) and the sandwiches are always a mess. Opening the bag of food results in an explosion of bread crumbs and other parts of the sandwich that they didn't bother putting on the bread. And somehow the customer service is worse than the food. Everyone who works there is extremely rude and barely speaks English. They regularly talk amongst themselves and completely ignore the customers. And they always prepare to close hours before the actual close time so good luck getting any drinks or chips past 6PM. They should fire every single person who works here or at least get them to give a damn. Delicious pizza that hits all the right notes! The service was outstanding and incredibly fast. I highly recommend giving this place a try! Came here for the first time on 3/25. It\u2019s my new favorite place! We got  a small meatball sub snd small pizza w/ meatball & peppers. Both were amazing! If you havent been, make sure you try it. This place is great. Great staff, excellent service! When you order extra sauce, they add so much extra sauce that it looks like they drowned your pasta in blood, but that is a pro because this sauce is AMAZING. (Get the extra sauce) Food is fresh and delicious and super fast delivery! The best pizza I\u2019ve ever had in town!! Queue formed as those who ordered for collection were given priority. Had to wait exceptionally long. Food was as expected. We are visitors to Boston from Canada. My two friends and I went for the something to eat. The friend made an order and the manager gave the wrong order. My friend asked to give the correct order. Manager was so rude and insisted that my friend gave the wrong order and refused to exchange but asked for money  for a new order. He just went to the back and played on his phone.\nThe table was unstable and the tea cup tipped over the table.  The staff s did not help clean the tea.\nPoor customer service. Great coffee, great donuts, excellent staff and awesome atmosphere. Was able to relax and enjoy my coffee. Asked for less ice and got half-empty cup A nice Dunkin with 4-5 tables for seating. So I tried a penne pasta and Cheese pizza slice at Sweet Tomatoes. the penne pasta is great, didn't like the tomatoes in it. hopefully, its replaced with bell peppers or carrots. The cheese pizza is my favorite so far. Didn't have a great experience with Popeye. The chicken tasted weird to me, Probably because I'm used to Indian cuisine and the Chicken is seasoned properly, Burger 373 has a better Chicken patty, but wished the patty was fried like it was in MC Donald or Burger King. I don't think I'll try Chicken burger in here again workers will stand around talking instead of serving you and making your food and when you do ask them about your order they\u2019re so rude and act as if I\u2019m inconveniencing them as if I\u2019m not the customer This Starbucks is on northeastern campus and I enjoy going there sometimes to just sit and relax.\n\nI mostly just order an espresso which is good (not the best) but still good enough that I keep going back.\n\nThe staff there is nice, some of them remember me and inquire if I don't go there for some time. This is pretty impressive because of the huge volume of customers. During school time they get so many customers and queues can be as long as 30 people  so I think it is pretty impressive they remember me. Great place to grab some quick food when visiting your student or when NU hosts an event, always a good selection of food. The bookstore is right next door as well. Second and last time eating here. The quality of food and service is not like other Subways I go to. Wonderful place! I'm so grateful to the excellent staff, who were very accommodating to my temporary inability to speak! The food is good, but not unbelievably good, although I certainly have no regrets about coming here! Good food at reasonable prices.  Not the best burritos or tacos ever, but solid and i loved the al pastor.\n\nService was nice, they offered me a water cup without me asking which I really appreciate.  The location is convenient, the interior feels slightly dingy but is decorated and painted. The food was very average and does not taste real Mexican food but was ok for the price and late night dinner.\nI had the al Pastor and the chorizo. The chorizo was not the typical meat we can find on other restaurants.\nThe atmosphere was cool, service was friendly! The food was very bland, flavorless, and inauthentic. The shrimp and chicken tacos were awful. The shrimp tasted like rubber. The chicken was flavorless. All of the \u201csides\u201dare shoved into the tacos. The rice, salsa and beans did not have a good flavor. The chips and queso were the best part of the meal. I also ordered the horchata and it was over powered with cinnamon powder, not authentic at all. Overall, very disappointing and inauthentic. Zero stars if I could leave zero. Impressive steak tacos at the burrito place! The ambiance had a gritty Gotham City vibe, and the crowd, mostly young, was a bit rowdy. Quaint decor, basic furnishings, and efficient chefs behind the counter. Despite the slow food delivery and a slightly high price, the delicious taste makes it worth the wait.

I don't think I'll try Chicken burger in here again workers will stand around talking instead of serving you and making your food and when you do ask them about your order they\u2019re so rude and act as if I\u2019m inconveniencing them as if I\u2019m not the customer This Starbucks is on northeastern campus and I enjoy going there sometimes to just sit and relax.\n\nI mostly just order an espresso which is good (not the best) but still good enough that I keep going back.\n\nThe staff there is nice, some of them remember me and inquire if I don't go there for some time. This is pretty impressive because of the huge volume of customers. During school time they get so many customers and queues can be as long as 30 people  so I think it is pretty impressive they remember me. Great place to grab some quick food when visiting your student or when NU hosts an event, always a good selection of food. The bookstore is right next door as well. Second and last time eating here. The quality of food and service is not like other Subways I go to. Wonderful place! I'm so grateful to the excellent staff, who were very accommodating to my temporary inability to speak! The food is good, but not unbelievably good, although I certainly have no regrets about coming here! Good food at reasonable prices.  Not the best burritos or tacos ever, but solid and i loved the al pastor.\n\nService was nice, they offered me a water cup without me asking which I really appreciate.  The location is convenient, the interior feels slightly dingy but is decorated and painted. The food was very average and does not taste real Mexican food but was ok for the price and late night dinner.\nI had the al Pastor and the chorizo. The chorizo was not the typical meat we can find on other restaurants.\nThe atmosphere was cool, service was friendly! The food was very bland, flavorless, and inauthentic. The shrimp and chicken tacos were awful. The shrimp tasted like rubber. The chicken was flavorless. All of the \u201csides\u201dare shoved into the tacos. The rice, salsa and beans did not have a good flavor. The chips and queso were the best part of the meal. I also ordered the horchata and it was over powered with cinnamon powder, not authentic at all. Overall, very disappointing and inauthentic. Zero stars if I could leave zero. Impressive steak tacos at the burrito place! The ambiance had a gritty Gotham City vibe, and the crowd, mostly young, was a bit rowdy. Quaint decor, basic furnishings, and efficient chefs behind the counter. Despite the slow food delivery and a slightly high price, the delicious taste makes it worth the wait. Soooo good. Black pepper beef with broccoli, chicken with string beans, and hot and sour soup were all 10/10. My 10 year old son said it was the best food he\u2019s ever had. Portions were BIG, great value for the price. We had enough food for probably 3 meals each! Oh man, now I totally get the buzz! Those dumplings were on fire\u2014in the best way possible\u2014and Olga's service? Absolutely top-notch! It's like dining with a culinary wizard spinning magic at your table! My seafood philosophy is usually to stick to coastal cities for fresh catch. However, the garlic fish in stone hot pot at Taiwanese Bistro Cafe has made me ditch my core belief system. This absolute melt-in-mouth amalgamation of flavor and white meat will forever be my favorite dish in Pittsburgh, so much that I managed to catch a trip even during my 10hr layover! Will always keep coming back here. Did I mention they have BYOB as well? One of my favorite spots in Squirrel Hill! They have an expansive menu and everything I\u2019ve tried has been tasty. This more recent time I had the chicken and string beans and chicken chow fun, which is my go to dish. Affordable and efficient service. This is one of my new favorite restaurants. The beef noodle soup was delicious. They even made it not spicy because I\u2019m a pussy. Service was fast and friendly. I brought my personal 20oz cup order a Venti hot latte only got 70% of drinks. Asked them to give me a bit more soy milk they just topped foam to cover that 30% of space in my cup. Terrible service. I ordered cherry chai tea. But they gave me a chai latte. Worst staff ever. They have started charging for lesser ice in ALL drinks. I ordered a matcha with no ice and they made me pay for LESS ICE AND NO ICE. I just paid for my overpriced drink, i did not pay for the ice. Just go down to the starbucks at columbus or huntington. Love this Starbucks always so nice and cheerful and my Mocha cookie crumble comes out so good every single time!!! The staff here is so rude. I\u2019ve never had an issue with my drink but after wanting to use my BOGO offer last weekend, I was told that wasn\u2019t a deal even after showing them the coupon. I also showed them how I am able to do it on the app but I use my husky card so I don\u2019t have to pay actual cash so I can\u2019t do it on the app. I called Starbucks customer service to make sure that I can use it there and they said I should be able to and gave me a refund for the drink which was great. I tried again today and once again I was denied but this the three staff members stood in front of me loudly saying to me I cannot use it. I felt students staring at me and it was completely embarrassing. One of the workers had the nerve to say \u201cyeah you complained and our manager told us about it\u201d after telling them Starbucks said this was a participating location when I called them. All I wanted to do was use the coupon and I was extremely nice about it and did not demand the coupon, I simply asked if I could use it. I did not need three staff members causing a scene or confronting me about how I \u201ccomplained\u201d because their manager spoke to them. I had to interrupt them ranting at me and tell them it was fine and I would like to order. Completely unprofessional Their store banner is still Royal Tea and branded as is. There is only one chinese worker who don't speak any english and no other customer in sight. Turns out they are no longer Royal Tea anymore after I received the order. This is NOT RIGHT, this is MISINFORMATION and FRAUDULENT!!! Best taro milk tea I\u2019ve ever gotten in Boston! And the tapioca boba always comes fresh made and warm. This place was underground and very relaxing atmosphere. I like that it was fast and quick. We got the matcha ice cream milk tea with pearls it was okay. The bubbles were mini and chewy. The prices here were very reasonable! great tea and their tapioca isn\u2019t bad. a better option on average than the majority of spots but there may be certain drinks that you would find better at other shops. We really enjoyed our Brown Sugar Milk Tea, and this place has cheese foam as a topping, which we love. Service was quick too. It's tucked away down stairs, so it can be easy to miss. Great location and atmosphere with tons of seats and a cozy environment. Drinks were great and all pastries and food options were appetizing. Service was great too, overall a good experience The seating is comfortable and inviting, but the place is often crowded with students. I tried the coconut coffee, but it was much sweeter than I expected. Would be great if they offered an option to adjust the sweetness when we ordered it. Guys, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn\u2019t know Caffe Bene existed in Boston. I would go quite often when I lived in NYC. And when there are cafe/restaurant plants from NYC in Boston, the quality can be a toss up. But I gotta say, the food tasted just as on-point as I remember. Especially the honey bread\u2026run don\u2019t walk for the mango gelato honey bread!! The pepperoni grilled cheese waffle sandwich wasn\u2019t bad, more of a novelty concept than impressive flavor. And the lattes are super fun. Thank God they don\u2019t serve them in COVID-remnant plastic cups but actual mugs :) Props to Bene for that! I am so happy I finally got to try this place!\nI highly recommend the peach yogurt smoothie, but my friend also really loved her mango peach smoothie. I also had the grilled cheese and it was pretty good too. I really want to try the shaved ice next time.\n\nI'm not sure if they have wifi, but I would definitely come here to study. I saw a lot of people coming here to study and I understand why they would come here. It's really nice inside, the music is nice and calm (not too loud), and the food and drinks are great too! Great place, nice atmosphere and very polite staff. Delicious food and coffee \u2764\ufe0f"

If you have no idea how to use a computer this program will help you. The thing is there is one extremely toxic staff member that will suck the soul right out of you. I suggest you ignore Saundra Greene the best you can. She is an ignorant shrew that thinks she is better than you, and is completely unprofessional. She will lie directly to your face and takes pleasure in weilding the tiny tiny amount of power she has at this basement. I haven't actually done anything in there but I've been there several times now. They have all kinds of tools for making things: 3d printers, computers, etc. I didn't get the best look around but plenty off tools to learn and be a competent person of the near future. I grew up in the technology center very great people Melking made a movement in so many ways and touch the lives of lots of young children with technology in the know how one of the best family ran organizations or establishments in urban community me and my kids enjoyed the center in educational establishment\u2019sIn progress is that was made and touched every young person who stepped foot in the center the best They provide a great service to the community through programs that engage various demographic groups in technology-based education. I've been going here for about 2 years. I use wash & fold and shirt service regularly. They do a great job! They also did some small adjustments for me which worked out well. I also had some specialty items including a comforter and shower curtain cleaned there. Always a great experience! My husband and I been going to this dry cleaner since 2016 and we always have a great experience, never had any issue. Will keep going :) Have been going to Tony\u2019s for 6 years. Moved neighborhoods 3 years ago and still bring him my wash and fold.  He\u2019s a good guy, honest, and his prices are very reasonable! I've only been to this dry cleaner once and I will never return. I dropped off two blazers (one black, one white) and one tan trench coat.\n\nThe black blazer was cleaned fine.\nThe white blazer was returned to me with scuff marks all over it and a giant yellow stain on the front pocket.\nThe trench was returned to me with the leather stripped off all of the belt buckles.\n\nThe cleaner replaced the belt and buckles on the trench, but the white blazer was ruined. I understand accidents happen, but when I asked the cleaner what my options were he said 'It's not my fault. I don't know what caused the stains. I'm not responsible.'\n\nHe made no offer to compensate me for my loss and when I got upset he yelled at me and kicked me out of his store.\n\nPlease tread carefully at this store. The owner is volatile and will scream at you if you're unhappy with his service. Tony is the man! I go here for my dry cleaning, even though I live in Jamaica Plain, because he's such a great guy and will often have on \"The Memory Station\" on the radio. On January 9, 2018 I canceled an order and requested a refund for a record,  which was back ordered, but never stated that when I placed the order. To this day   Not only have I never heard from anybody in the company, I have never received my refund and I have nine open tickets that are in pending status!  Today I am filing a complaint against the company with the federal trade commission, the New Jersey state tourney general, and the Better Business Bureau ! Loyal UGHH customer since the flagship store in Boston was still around. Unfortunately, I will not be shopping at UGHH ever again or recommending it to anybody. I ordered a vinyl album almost 3 weeks ago. The order is still unfulfilled and customer service reps haven't contacted me after multiple attempts trying to reach out to them. There's no phone number or way to get in contact with anybody after you pay for your order. Save your money and buy from somewhere else. Worst online shopping experience. Same issue here\u2014sucks to see this is happening but glad I\u2019m not the only one. I ordered 2 records and haven\u2019t received a response since placing my order over a week ago. I\u2019ve sent multiple emails to no avail. They were quick to process payment of course though. Will be contacting my bank. First and last time ordering from here. Well after being a loyal customer for year since it been open. I will never shop with them again. The email they sent out was blasphemy explaining their reason. But that could of been addressed on their site after losing most of their staff. I order 2 vinyl evidence weather or not and planet Asia Golden Buddha. Still to this day they haven\u2019t replied back to my email that I sent roughly 8 times. Still no replies my last one was very nasty because it\u2019s been a month since I ordered it. I have two weeks with a an unfulfilled order from 01/28/18 and I don't receive any Tracking Number of my Purchase, The Money was debited from my Credit Card. I opened several tickets and I do not receive a response from you. No one answers your phone number. This is a disaster and I speak as an old client when the store was in Boston. BE CAREFULL WITH THESE THIEVES! I brought my trumpet in for valve alignment, cleaning and repair, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the service! The staff took great care of my instrument, and their friendliness made the whole experience even better. They did an excellent job. If I ever have any issues with my trumpet in the future, I will definitely be coming back. Highly recommend this shop to anyone needing instrument repair or maintenance! Virtuosity is a world-class brass and woodwind store. From their incredible selection of products to their knowledgeable and friendly staff, folks in Boston do not know how lucky they are to have such an awesome music store in their town. And if that weren't enough, they have cold brew coffee on tap and a new espresso maker. If you are in Boston or are just passing through, make sure you stop in! Robbie was particularly helpful in facilitating a great experience. He knew the product and had great suggestions for alternatives when it came to finding a great mouthpiece/ligature combination. Great service! I had a very positive experience buying my brand new professional level trombone at Virtuosity. It turned out that the horn had some manufacturer\u2019s defects. Steve Johnson and his team of professionals at Virtuosity processed the problem with the manufacturer and replaced the horn. I\u2019m so glad that I bought my horn at a reputable musical instrument dealer, and not online, because the personal customer service made all the difference. It\u2019s a good feeling to know I can confidently go to Virtuosity for ongoing advice and future service. Steve, the owner, and Brett, the woodwind specialist, are consumate professionals. They are dedicated to making sure that when you visit you are taken care of as well as answering any questions that you may have. My daughter tried 6 clarinets out before making her decision. She is very happy as are we with the decision she made as well as taking the three hour trip to Boston for the purchase.\n\nThank you again for making us feel welcome and we will continue to do business with you as she pursues her music minor in college. Cohens fashion optical in cambridge Galleria mall is awesome, I got my eye glasses and sun glasses from there and also had an eye exam,  I love that place do not go by the reviews on yelp, trust me it is the best place when it comes to professionally, service opticians are so knowledgeable an add helpful and friendly so as the sales people and the technician\nI extremely love this place The worst mall to go. You will get towed at Best buy or at the Meter. I just picked up my car for 143 dollars at the towing shop. I went to buy Television at Best buy. Closing to many good stores will not have any reason to go soon!!!! I deliver there they keep the place clean IMO  in the back halls that is... I'm not allow to mingle up front so I bet it's just as clean. The mall seemed both clean and operational... Great job guys! This is a warm and welcoming space.  I felt a calm serenity when I entered.  The attendant was very helpful and gave me a detailed tour of the resources to explore.  I joined in with others in reading the Sermon on the Mount aloud in a modern version of the Bible.  I learned a lot in the process!  I will definitely return to  participate in other activities there, and to know that this is a special haven of peace in a busy city where I can commune with God and find healing.

Thanks for all Staff. Great place to do research religiously and scientific!! How much is a Bible? Update: I was able to get my $42 refund after 76 days of not receiving my product. I was able to seek legal council and mention the law requires them to refund buyers if product is not shipped within 30 days of purchase. Thank you Bodega! I appreciate the refund. I only had to write 8 separate emails to Bodega support. \ud83d\udc4d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOriginal Review: I have been a long time supporter and friend of the Bodega store since 2006. I have shopped in their store countless times and I have ordered many items from them over the past 19+ years. But I am writing a negative review now because I ordered over $100 of items from them on December 17, 2024.\n\nI received everything in my order except for one hat. I have written to customer support numerous times about this Bodega Hat. I tried calling, but there is no connection via phone.\n\nMiguel at Bodega Support keeps saying he can\u2019t help me and I should keep waiting. It feels like they are just copy pasting an email template to everyone.\n\nI asked to cancel the sale and he says they can\u2019t cancel or refund the sale. But it\u2019s been over two months since I ordered this hat and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m getting it. Such a shame. Don\u2019t do this. Bodega don\u2019t do this!!!!! Don\u2019t do it Bodega. I see you bro. Don\u2019t do this. \u261d\ufe0f Update: Took many emails with \"customer support\" as well as calls with the bank. Was finally able to cancel my order after 60+ days. Lesson learned. Don't make the mistake a lot of us did...\n\nDont order from online.  Customer Service will be automated and say that it will take more than a few weeks to fulfill. Not worth your time and money to shop here if you want to keep your sanity.\n\nImagine spending $400 and waiting more than a month to receive the items. Crazy... I am so disappointed - we have shopped with Bodega for a few years now, but recently they have been AWFUL. I purchased a shirt from them online on December 13th. I STILL have not received my package as of February 7th. Every time I reach out I get an email from Miguel who tells me they are \u201cdiligently working\u201d to fulfill my order. Since it has been nearly 2 months I said I would just like I refund. Miguel told me that I am ineligible for a refund because it was an item on sale. IT IS LITERALLY ILLEGAL for them to take my money and not give me what I paid for.\nThis company has become a total joke and you should definitely take your money to another store- plenty of them have far better options and WAY better customer service I don\u2019t know what kind of sketchy stuff is going on here but I don\u2019t know a single retailer that\u2019s still in business today that\u2019s doing what bodega does. Online orders do not ship for MONTHS and they REFUSE to refund you. Customer service is extremely incompetent. DO NOT shop with them. Also not to mention they literally have a SINGULAR person working for customer support it seems (Miguel) 3 months after order and i keep getting nothing but snarky responses from someone at Bodega. They refuse to update me with any information about my order or provide a refund. I've had to dispute with my bank. This is a terrible company.

Unfortunately becoming all too common with these types of stores I have been using Flour to send seasonal treats to my daughter at MIT for the past 3.5 years. Everytime, the baked goods are perfection! I love that there is a delivery and convenient local pick-up option. I'm going to miss this bakery when she graduates in a few months.Even her cat gives his approval! Delicious sticky bun & latte!!  The banana bread & Oreo cookie were alright\u2026 as was the Cubano sandwich. The star is the sticky bun- definitely try this pastry!! The perfect spot for a sweet treat or a lovely lunch. One of several locations. Flour has never disappointed. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly. The product is exceptional. One of my favorite spots in Boston. The best lunch sandwich I have ever had was here. The butternut squash sandwich is unforgettable, the perfect combination of textures and flavors. The soft squash is a great vegetarian option for a sandwich. I still think about how incredible this tasted, for a very fair price as well.\n\nWhen I am back in Boston I need to try the cauliflower curry sandwich from this place. The chai tea was better than average as well. The chocolate chip cookie was disappointing though, not soft and didn\u2019t taste fresh. Fantastic spot for a midday lunch break if you can grab one of the few tables available. I\u2019ve only ever gotten the Sticky Sticky Bun once a long time ago; I forgot how massive these things are! Gotta say, I appreciate Flour\u2019s prices because pastries are quite expensive elsewhere nowadays. It was $5.25 for this bun. The name is fitting because it is sticky indeed and oh so decadent. It surprisingly isn\u2019t so sweet that it would be unheard of to finish in one sitting, but I recommend portioning it like I did. Flour provides the ingredient list for all their pastries online, but it would be great if they could provide the macros as well. Ive never had lash extensions before for the first time I went here, I went on a rainy day which might have affected how long my lashes would stay on. I got them done a day before I left and because I was gone I could not get a refill right away when my lashes would just fall rapidly(most likely due to the rainy day) when I told them about it being worried that I have to pay for a whole new set, they were so kind and generous and redid my lashes for me with no charge. So if anything, one of the kindest customer service I've seen.\n\nI also love how her lashes work with my monolids! It works so well and looks so natural which was what I asked for. amazing nail salon! this is the only nail salon i've visited that applies sunscreen when doing the UV light which i appreciated. i got acrylics and they are exactly what i wanted. huge color selection. pricing is average considering nail salons in the city tend to be pricey. Definitely going back! This is the 4th time I\u2019ve gotten my nails done here, and they are flawless everytime!! Each time I\u2019ve made an appointment and gotten seated immediately. The employees are so kind and take their time making sure my nails are perfect! Highly recommend. The perfect pedicure! I have high standards for what I consider a good pedicure and I truly couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more. Cindy was incredibly meticulous and thorough. My feet were in rough shape after going a while between pedicures and they looked awesome when I left. Cindy went out of her way to provide a great experience including by proactively asking if I liked  the color after the first coat and redoing it in a different color no questions asked. This is my new go-to spot! Yesterday I asked about the price first.They always add something extra after. Even the color you choose can be $22 more, couple minutes before it was $10. I liked the lady who did the pedicure, she barely know english but was very nice. The lady who came after to do my nail was talking to me very rude and had rush. After she talkes to me she yell in another \u015fanguage to the other worker. After paying 103$ I was expecting somwthing nice. Here are the pictures: I have been getting cut and color there for over a year. Best stylist in Boston. Prices way below newbury st. Everyone who goes there looks fabulous. Haircuts last for months. Jack is by far the best haircutter. A great person. If you are looking for a fabulous hairdresser, you will find it here I have been going to Jacques\u2019 for three years now and it\u2019s always a delight. Wonderful guy with the best haircuts in Boston by far. Incredible Stylist, Will Getchel specializing in every area of Hair Care- styling, coloring, cutting,  and hair maintenance!

Many Indian delicacies are available but at somewhat higher price. Some frozen food items are available at reasonable price. Great store but a few months ago they ran out of the deep cocktail potato samosas. These were my favorite product and they still haven\u2019t restocked. If the store sees this, please try to add this back to your inventory. I am very sad to change this review from 5-stars to 3 stars.\n\nPlenty about this place still slaps -- the spice wall is unrivaled, great ramen selection, frozen paneer and breads, as well as dosa batter.\n\nThe prices have evidently gone up. I went recently and paid almost $60 for a single bag of groceries -- granted, here's what I got:\n\n- 2x Haldiram large blocks of paneer (800g)\n- 1x Deep's small bag of kashmiri chili powder (200g)\n- 1x Deep's small bag of garam masala (200g)\n- 1x Haldiram family size bag of aloo paratha (1.6kg)\n\nLooking online, I am able to assemble many carts that beat this price. I would rather shop in person, but $60 for this cart is very unreasonable, especially considering there are many Indian students living nearby with few other options.\n\nI understand the high prices may not be the fault of this store, but the prices have gotten out of hand.\n\nStill, I love this store. Slightly overpriced but still a good spot with tons of Indian grocery options. Service in this store is very hit and miss. The owner is wonderful, but one of the young women behind the counter is so disrespectful as to make it a better choice to shop in one of the convenience stores nearby. Today after twice not having scratched solutions fields in a winning lottery ticket to her liking and being rudely told to do better, I decided that my dignity is not worth the shorter trip. Pros: Food tasted good and fresh. I also liked that you order through a QR code.\n\nCons: Portion sizes are definitely way too small for the cost. It\u2019s actually frustrating thinking about how cheap lentils and that kind of thing are and then looking at the tiny portion. We paid $50 for a shared plate, it could\u2019ve at least been filled full. This place looks very unassuming from the outside, but has a cozy area in the back inside. The flavors are delicious and the teas are a must -- either the regular or the peanut one. A very solid spot for small groups going to the Symphony. Food-wise, I'd say their lamb combo for two is a good start. Great Ethiopean food, prices reasonable.  Try the Peanut Tea !!\nPortions are large.  We had a meal for free and didn't finish it.  Extra bread available. What a delicious restaurant!  We were craving Ethiopian food on a rainy day and found this place. Everything was absolutely delicious. The peanut tea was fabulous - we\u2019d never had it before but will definitely get it again!  Milky and nutty and sweet - so good!  We got one lamb combo and one chicken combo, both were excellent. The lentils, split peas, and potatoes+carrots were particularly good. We also got Injera with split pea curry appetizer, which was so good. The Injera is so soft and light here, definitely the best I\u2019ve ever had. Highly recommend!! This was our first time here, and first experience with Ethiopian food. It was delicious! I had the 4 vegetable combo and my partner had a lamb dish. It was served with a generous side of Ethiopian bread. I tried the peanut tea (amazing) and he had traditional tea (also amazing). Everything was served quickly and HOT, which was appreciated on a very cold night. Can\u2019t wait to go back. Nice little breakfast nook on Huntington Ave, basically, across from the Cheesecake factory. The breakfast is on point. I had the basic, two eggs, toast, home fries. I really enjoyed the visit . The waitress was beyond  refreshing. So fast and efficient. Many restaurants can learn from her. I've been to plenty where the wait staff don't have any excuses to be so slow. The restaurant is large and busy. I've gone to smaller places where the staff acts like they can't see you. Good portions at reasonable prices. I recommend getting a variation of their egg Benedict. I got the Oscars egg Benedict which was delicious; the poached egg was perfectly cooked and the egg muffin was well toasted. I liked how they had veggies (red onions, string beans too) the only thing is that the crab cake itself is very thin but you do still get bits of the crab.\n\nMy friend got the shakshuka which came with 2 pieces of toasts, which she liked because the texture of the eggs was smooth and the tomatoes were well blended with the eggs.\n\nThe only thing I have issue with this restaurant is they pressure you into tipping 18 percent. Personally, I don\u2019t think the service is good enough to deserve 18 percent, I had to flag the waitress multiple times. I just didn\u2019t like how she pressured me to tip a certain amount. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how tipping works and honestly this tipping culture really got out of hand. Talk about a hidden gem here in Boston, located in the Back Bay area across from the Prudential. Thornton's is definitely a great breakfast spot to come in and eat delicious food. I am a local, live no more than 10 minutes away and have always passed by here but never thought to come in. I will say, I do regret this (shame on me) and wished I came in sooner. Loved our waitress, Maeve, she was very sweet and accommodating. Her attention to detail and being very attentive to us this morning was exceptional. While she served us; I had noticed her diligence in serving those around us. She didn't miss a beat. Great job, and who ever was cooking in the kitchen this morning, AMAZING JOB. Food was hot, tasty w/ great flavor and nothing short of exceptional. Highly recommend anyone to come on in and experience Thornton's for yourself. I shall be back for another breakfast or even swing by for lunch. Thank You Maeve & Thorntons for a great experience. See you all soon! Great food and amazing service.\n\nTraditional American diner serving delicious food. Highlights were the eggs benedict and hot chocolate.\n\nExcellent service, the staff couldn't do enough for us and we're always pleasant and charming. Big shout out to Eric for his 6-star customer service\n\nWe visited multiple times during our stay in Boston and can heartily recommend Thorntons! Food was excellent. Only small issue was the size of the chicken in the chicken sandwich, as well as the size of the bowl with the chili. Definitely could be bigger given the price.\n\nOther than that, the taste of the food, the overall atmosphere, and the service were great. Looking forward to my next visit. I had the pleasure of dining at Summer Shack while visiting the Boston area, and it was fantastic! The atmosphere is laid-back and relaxed, perfect for enjoying a casual meal. The seafood was fresh, flavorful, and served up quickly, which was a nice surprise. Everything from the clam chowder to the lobster was absolutely delicious.\n\nOur waitress, Ariana, made the experience even better with her friendly attitude and excellent customer service. She was attentive, yet not overbearing, and made us feel right at home. If you\u2019re in the area and looking for great seafood in a relaxed setting, Summer Shack is definitely worth a visit! The food was tasty and the drinks were cold! Our server Chris was knowledgeable and very helpful. I will definitely be coming back. Thanks I was there recently for a quick bite on the annual Boston Marathon day.  Looking for a casual but good seafood place, I stumbled upon this restaurant, and was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nI expected a run of the mill menu, with some seafood dishes scattered among the regular bar food cuisine.  However, not only did I find a very decent selection of seafood, the quality surpassed my expectations.  Starting with the mouth watering Crab Cake appetizer, the absolutely delicious and flavorful Bouillabaisse (with a very hearty sauce and a generous amount of shrimp and mussels) for the main course, and finally to the biggest surprise, one of the best Pecan Pies for dessert, I could not have been more satisfied.  Sitting at the bar and having this great food was an additional treat, as the staff is very friendly and relaxed, and the ambiance very inviting and warm.\n\nIt was a great decision on my part to walk into this place on a whim, but it will definitely be a place I will return to.  If you happen to be in the area and want a lively, good seafood experience, with very reasonable prices, this is a great choice. Lovely restaurant! Awesome lobster and services. Atmosphere is a bit bar-alike, not bad though but wasn\u2019t something I expecting. Anyhow, I recommend Summer Shack! Price, taste and portion are absolutely great. If I would have known sooner, this would have been my first stop while here in Boston!! The food, service, vibe\u2026 all great!\nWe had the lobster roll.. very good, although I do wish I could return for the warm butter lobster roll \ud83d\ude0a. The oysters were so fresh and delicious.\n\nWhen I return, I\u2019ll Be Back at Summer Shack. I had the pleasure of dining at Summer Shack while visiting the Boston area, and it was fantastic!

We didn\u2019t get much but what we do get was just fine.\nThe wings were nice! Meaty and crisp! My so. Wanted nachos so that\u2019s what we got\u2026 they were decent. He liked them. \ud83d\ude0a\nStaff was great. Very attentive and polite. 32$ for a breakfast Buffett that does not even offer good quality products? I don\u2019t mind paying for food that is good but this breakfast buffet  is really bad. Party of 2, check was 88$ for the most horrible breakfast I\u2019ve ever had, not even the coffee was good \ud83d\ude12. I do not recommend this place is not worth it just walk across the street to FLOUR bakery , is pricey but at least the quality is OK Overall okay, but there is much better options nearby. The food was just okay. Long wait periods even though there were very few customers. Most of the waiters were inattentive, but Desmond was great!!! He noticed that our waiter wasn\u2019t checking on us and got our meal order in right away. Went for breakfast since we were staying in the hotel, we should\u2019ve checked the reviews because the food was mediocre at best. The prices are very inflated as well. The pancakes were dry, the eggs Benedict was mediocre. The muffin the eggs were on was dry. The potatoes were undercooked.\n\nHighlight: service was good and our server was kind. Hopefully this restaurant will do better in the future. Good food, great service, a bit overpriced. I had the most wonderful experience at Zuma! From the moment I walked in, the ambiance was inviting and stylish, setting the perfect tone for a memorable meal. The service was exceptional\u2014attentive without being overbearing, and the staff made sure every detail was taken care of.\n\nThe food was absolutely top-notch! Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The sushi and robata grill were highlights, offering fresh and perfectly cooked options. The drink selection was impressive, and the cocktails were expertly crafted.\n\nOverall, Zuma delivered a flawless dining experience. I left feeling completely satisfied and already looking forward to my next visit. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a sophisticated yet laid-back atmosphere with excellent food and service! We had a great dining experience at Zuma! We ordered passion fruit sidecars which were delicious. All of our food had great flavor- the baked potato being our favorite! We ended with the exotic fruit dessert and it was all so fresh and delicious. The mango sorbet was soooooo good! The food was mid and very pricey for very little amounts. I can recommend a lot of different restaurants that\u2019s in boston that\u2019s way better than this\ud83d\ude2d we waited around 60 mins for our sushi(2 maki rolls) and almost 40 mins for our dessert\u2026 If you had to pick something to eat, the only thing i can recommend is the baked cheesecake but it is $30\u2026 Never again(from everyone who ate with me today). it was 125+ per person with food that would just fill your stomach. We had enjoyed dining at Zuma over the past few years and always ordered the premium set dinners. But over time, we noticed that some of the set dinner items were replaced with lower quality ingredients. For example, a scallop replaced the lobster tempura, the cut of beef for the steak was tougher. We now order a la carte to get what we like instead.\n\nThe food is good in general. Their nigiri is always fresh. The watercress salad, rice hot pots, and miso cod are some of our favorites. This time, the soft shell crab was over fried and coating was a bit bland. The vegetable tempura batter was too thick. The shiitake mushrooms robata was served in a sauce that we didn't expect. It tasted fine but we had wanted it simply grilled. The apple cake dessert had a thin cake disc at the bottom that was almost non-existent. The meringue and the rest of the dessert tasted good and not too sweet, just needed more cake.\n\nThis restaurant has a great modern vibe and a great atmosphere for enjoying a nice dinner out. Service is friendly and efficient. Even though some dishes don't always hit the mark, there are always highlights that make the dining experience an enjoyable one. Everything was absolutely impeccable! What an experience. They have four different kitchens. The best sushi ever great steaks. Fresh wasabi flown in. Truffle flown in! It was my husband\u2019s birthday the dessert platter was the most intricate this with a lot of different sweets. High-end expect to spend some money Excellent VEGAN cuisine. CANNOT RECOMMEND ENOUGH. This is REAL vegan cuisine. Very bold about being vegan and environmentally friendly. No trash and minimal waste. Staff are friendly, kind, and welcoming. The owner is amazing and is truly passionate about the food she serves! Wide variety of food options from savor and sweet bowls to coffees to soups to wraps to hot sandwiches. Also have a fridge with grab and go options. Extremely reasonable and affordable pricing. Delicious. So tasty and packed with REAL ingredients. Awesome all round! Only con is lack of seating and restroom however is geared toward take out and grab and go so it is understandable. Great costumer service! Best fresh smoothie,  bowels, soups, oatmeal and much more. Go check it out if you in the area. My favorite smoothie is the Easy. The bowl in the pic was amazing! I was so full after, I had to take the smoothie home for later. While traveling for business, I have been trying to find a healthy spot to get some green juice/smoothie, and found this spot. When I entered, the owner, Heather was there. She was SUPER nice and welcoming! She explained everything including what's popular, how they make everything in-house, including their sauces, soups, etc.\n\nI ordered D'Boom Smoothie, which was one of their most popular smoothie. It was quite tasty, nice sweetness from all the fruits, very filling and satisfying. I felt great, and amazing for your body and soul!\n\nIt was a quite chilly day, so I also ordered one of their homemade soups. I ordered Creamy Tomato Basil Soup as a side order. The soup was oh-so-tomato-y with elegant basil flavor that followed after.\n\nNaturally, I went back few more times after that. I got The Smoothie, which was very citrusy, I could really taste the orange. Super refreshing! I also got the Daily Special Soup, which was kind of a Shepard's Pie soup. Very hearty and filling. Very comforting cup of soup for sure! I also purchased a snack for later, Date Truffles. They were perfect little sweet snacks.\n\nThis spot certainly was a hit, I loved their smoothies and soups. My body was thanking me for feeding the healthy, all-so-good-for-you food and drinks. If you body needs a little break from the rich food, give this spot a try! Meet Heather, who is the owner, the day we went in. She is amazing!! Very friendly and she made my smoothie just the way I like it. Will definitely spread the word and wish there was one of these in Michigan. Thank you for the awesome experience. This is a cool little spot in the Prudential center that has all fresh homemade vegetarian vegan food wonderful smoothies soups I believe sandwiches you can look at my pictures for the menu it was really cute small but good food Maybe my favorite cafe in Boston to get work done! The Sweet Potato sandwich is delicious and I love to get their iced maple lattes. So cozy! Cozy place to get work done, Zucchini muffin was delicious, but coffee was just okay, very convenient location but not too many seats so be prepared to take it to go! Great spot for a non mass produced coffee experience. Staff were friendly and the coffee shop cosy. Plenty of students from nearby NEU campus. Looked very cultural inside Lovely coffee shop!! The cutest interior that makes you want to spend hours in one of their cozy chairs. Service was great.  Their seasonal gingerbread latte was good! What a lovely coffee shop. Good and very reasonably priced food too. Cheerful customer service. I got the honey lavender latte which I liked a lot because it wasn\u2019t too sweet. Also a breakfast burrito. Don\u2019t know too many places in that part of Boston near the Mapparium where you can get good value. This place rocks! Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny.

    "reviews": "Small community library. Bring & carry My 2 star rating is based on value of the experience. It shouldn't reflect on the driver or guide. The driver and guide were nice and friendly and the guide did her best to make it a fun trip  There are better ways to spend $50/person. We did this experience on a sunny, cool day in November. Our duck left its plastic windows down, probably because of the wind, but I noticed some others that left their windows rolled up (and would have been nicer to see and take pictures). It was an ok experience for me, not spectacular. It's not a \"must do\" activity.. Personally, I would have rather ridden a trolley that I could hop on and off at my leisure or done The View.\n\nUpdate: As we did more sightseeing I found myself referring to information our guide shared. I changed my review from 2 stars to 4. Better than I initially thought. Worth doing at least once. Had a really fun time on the Duck Tour. The guide was great telling us a bunch of facts about the city and kept us entertained with some humor along the way. Honestly had a better time with the driving portion than the time on the water. But the water was fun too. Several people got to drive the boat. Only thing making this 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. Little more than I wanted to spend but everything is expensive these days so I get it. I would recommend if you want a break from walking around the city and want to sit for a while and enjoy the sights. The weather was awful, cold, wind and rain. But we had an amazing tour guide who saved our day. Her name was Paprika and she was so much fun. We enjoyed the drive around Boston and river sailing. I would bring more of my friends and guests to this tour. Growing up in the Boston area, I never really considered doing one of the quacky tours but coming back to visit with my young kids and looking for an adventure before our appointment we figured\u2026why not\u2026 just amazing! First, our Duckrator Ripple Stillwater was an absolute gem, his jokes were really funny and the knowledge of Boston was impressive. I knew some things, but I learned a lot more\u2026 then the Duck we were on was the coolest ride in town\u2026 let\u2019s drive on the street and then go for a boat ride without getting out of the vehicle!! That\u2019s cool. Veteran supported, history made and fun times had by all including being on the Charles river and seeing things never seen before. Recommended highly by a former Bostonian and would do it again!! Boston Duck Tour is an entertaining experience both for adults and children to enjoy and learn the history of the Boston / US Revolution. The duck travels on road as well as Charles River waters, while professional guide narrate valuable history tales when passing the iconic buildings or places.Kids enjoy the scenes around on surface or water.This also gives opportunity to see the Cambridge buildings, including MIT/ Harvard Business School, apart from Boston University on Boston side. We visited in October 2020  with family and enjoyed. Ground staff needs training, and their contact  telephone needs to be attentive all the time. Excellent store to purchase the chocolates and confectionery items from Lindt store. It is located near the shopping street. Best place to purchase in Boston.\n\nThey run a few offers on combo packs and assprted choloates pack. The quality of chocolates is top-notch. The staff is courteous. The prices are value for money. I LOVE this store. Sure its a little on the expensive side, but so worth it with loads of flavours and all quantities available. I usually stop by every other week to get a few chocolates, and love seeing the different and rotating flavours. I love this store! Michelle and Michael were lovely and helped me a lot! Excellent place to get souvenirs for family and friends! You can also treat yourself to a great variety of sweet beverages worthy of the name! The shop is little bit smaller but they have so many varieties. And staff members are really helpful. Cashier Lady is really lovely, she helped me in cost cutting.\nWill definitely visit again whenever I want to buy Lindt chocolates. Superb service! The male postmaster who helped us was very patient and gives out chill helpful vibes.\nI was afraid to visit the usps stores since they all have low rating. However, this was a good, smooth experience. I am extremely disappointed with the service at this USPS location. The following issues need urgent attention:\n\n1) Frequent Delivery Errors\nThe delivery personnel here consistently deliver packages to the wrong addresses. This has caused significant delays and, in some cases, loss of important items as IRS and imigrante letters.\n\n2) Rude Teller Attitude\nThe tellers at the counter are incredibly rude and show no respect for customers. Whenever I ask questions or try to resolve an issue, I feel as though I am being treated as an inconvenience rather than a valued customer.\n\nIf these issues are not resolved, I strongly suggest replacing the entire staff with individuals who are responsible and understand the importance of customer service. If this experience continues, I will have no choice but to avoid using this USPS entirely. Tried rescheduling a passport appointment but no one answered the phone after multiple calls. We then showed up, waited thirty minutes, and then were told after the wait that the camera was broken. Staff was not respectful of our time or communicative. For work I have to send a lot of things return receipt.  Many post office workers seem frustrated by this and limit me to sending a certain number at a time.  Erik was very patient and kind. I would choose this post office over any others if Erik could be the one assisting me! Kiosk wasn\u2019t printing my prepaid label and when I went to the counter the lady told me they don\u2019t print labels there and was very passive. Went back to the other Kiosk and was able to print the label there. She wasn\u2019t very helpful BE AWARE! NM\u2019s Gift card event can be a scam!\nPlaced an order with an anniversary coupon NM sent to me. Had my screenshot right before placing the order with application of the coupon code and saying I\u2019m still qualifying for a gift card worth $125. Two months later, their gift card department told me my order actually didn\u2019t qualify for a gift card since I used a coupon. If they told me the time I placed the order, I would turn to better price choices.\nReally doubt the reason why they even have a gift card department for customer service, probably due to too many complaints. The girl said they don\u2019t even have a manger that I can seek help from.\nTry your best to avoid this gift card event. Won\u2019t do business with them anymore.\nShame on NM! One of the worst customer service experiences I\u2019ve ever had. I placed an order online that was supposed to be ready for pickup the next day by 12 noon. However, when the next day came around, I didn\u2019t receive an email confirming that my order was ready, even though it was well past the promised time.\n\nI called their customer service line to get an update, and the experience was awful. The representative was incredibly rude, dismissive, and unhelpful. To make matters worse, they hung up on me and outright said they couldn\u2019t assist me.\n\nThis is unacceptable. I expected better communication and professionalism, but instead, I\u2019m left frustrated and without my order. I won\u2019t be shopping here again. The worst customer service I\u2019ve ever experienced if I could rate a zero star I would my girlfriend purchased a Creed fragrance as a Christmas gift for me she picked up the package at the Boston store drove over an hour when she got back home she took the.package out of the bag and the box was dirty the order was supposed to come with a sample also that she never received totally unacceptable I am sure they kept that sample for themselves after reaching out to Creed Directly they told me that it was unacceptable for their product to leave the store that way and with a high end store like Neiman Marcus they shouldn\u2019t have overlooked the presentation of their product they told me i should reach out to the store directly which I did and spoke to a rude person in the fragrance department that said as long as the bottle inside was fine there isn\u2019t anything they could do I also asked for a manager none were available I was giving an email for a Rose manager that I emailed twice with no response and by all means Creed fragrances aren\u2019t cheap for me it\u2019s the principal of things to do the right thing rude staff and incompetent managers that won\u2019t return your calls or emails but I bet they\u2019ll follow up with the useless response to contact them via email so that they can investigate well let me save you the trouble nothing will get done. I am extremely disappointed and I\u2019ll go back to shopping at saks fifth avenue for my fragrances and etc\u2026 where the customer service is impeccable ladies and gentlemen I don't recommend you shop here no high standards for their customers awful awful customer service! Zero star and please send me my sample that was promised with the expensive purchase shape up or you are are going to have a lot more of these reviews from upset customers. Neiman Marcus Boston has the best cosmetic department of all department stores in Massachusetts! One of the only store that offers my favorite brand - Givenchy Beauty.\nLe Soin Noir has the hidden secret of youth. The serum and the creams firm with black algae.\nI tried Givenchy\u2019s new foundation what is my new must have. It is a gluten free product with 24 hours hydration and glow. You must try it! Free samples were available!\nI picked up a Le Rouge Baume lip treatment for my stressed lips. We all need this from the stress of wearing the mask.\n\nThe store offers complimentary events on the weekends for their customers such as bottle panting to personalize your own products/ gift and you can enjoy a fun DJ during your shopping. This last weekend was Holly Nicholas\u2019s book lunch \u201cModern Fashion Illustration\u201d.\nMs Nicholas was presenting live illustrations. She wrote and inspirational message and signed her book for my daughter. This going to be one of her 14th birthday present.\n\nI visited the jewelry department and shoe department. I purchased my favorite lingerie from Chantelle.\n\nThe store is very clean and safe to shop even during the pandemic. Everybody wears masks. The associates are nice and the customer service is incredible. They are very personable and helpful.\nIf you can\u2019t find your product you can pay in the store and the sales associate can order it for you.\n\nThis is one of the oldest department stores in Boston.\nI highly recommend you to shop in the store. I\u2019m writing this review at 10:11 pm Saturday night after a long day and a long week.  I\u2019m a Dental Professional in private practice and take care of elite and the less fortunate in two different practices in the Boston area. I started my day in my FIGS green monogrammed scrubs into the S.End and was exhausted so I stopped and grabbed lunch from a really nice Indian restaurant and decided to eat it in the Copley, Back Bay entrance near Cafe Nero..\nthere were no trash cans to toss my items to discard.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019m walking around with backpack, Mask, head cover.. and I decided to check out Neiman\u2019s Family & Friends sale but especially Longchamp bags; love their leather bags.\n\nI walk in with my items to discard, no trash barrels in sight, no nearby restrooms & proceed to ask an Employee \u201c where are your Longchamp bags?\u201d He says \u201coh to the back, Anna can help you \u201c . I went to the back , mind you I currently use a medium sized caramel blush Longchamp crossbody.\n\nI walk to the section and see Anna a full figured woman who was checking Inventory with her male Asian \u201cAmerican\u201d colleague and asked \u201c by chance do you guys have a trashcan as I\u2019ve been looking for one, Anna responded \u201c they didn\u2019t have one in the Mall? I said \u201c no they didn\u2019t have one and she said they should have one.. \u201c I said \u201c well they didn\u2019t, I looked and do you really think I\u2019d be walking around with trash if I could have thrown it away\u201d?\n\nShe did not offer to toss it.. not that she had to but hey\u2026. It was the \u201caccusatory side eye\u201d\nAnyway with trash in hand and\nAgainst my better judgment, I stayed in the store looking at the bag I\nWanted to purchase, brought it over to Anna who gave me the price but I decided Not to purchase it, the bag costs over $200.\n\nI didn\u2019t splurge because I didn\u2019t want her to get commission on the sale.\n\nI went to Saks where I was treated with sincere dignity and respect and Purchased the bag that made my whole shopping experience worth it after such a long work week.\n\nI\u2019m truly tired of the shenanigans of Customer Service.\n\nEither you are sincere and professional or you are not on the first shot..\n\nI love it when people show you Who they are\u2026 Respectfully..\nStrive to do better.. Always..\nmy current bag & the Saks Bag \ud83c\udfaf Door don\u2019t work!! very typically with chase bank in Massachusetts getting a little annoying only way to get cash is to walk into another bank, might as well open a bank account with them instead atleast I can get into the atm, convenience is key Setting aside the fact that the entire banking industry is extremely predatory, Davidson was so very helpful.

This is a general Tesla company review, not specific to this store, I was so mad after we discuss within the family, what was discussed was so distorted. Well, I spoke to Tesla Corp, so service was bad as well. So an extra review here: Buyers be aware that car price can change even after putting down the deposit. Also read the order agreement, the word of rep doesn\u2019t count. Tesla Dealer in South Boston. This is near the shopping malls. We stopped in and they had cars for display BUT I was more attracted to the AI Tesla Robot 2023! I\u2019ve never seen a bot this close up and the description of what the bots main uses reminded me of a book I read in college called \u201cThe Singularity is Near.\u201d If you know, you know. If you don\u2019t, even better. Customer service initially started off very well, but communication became difficult as time went on. I worked with a representative named Langa, who was helpful at first. However, the challenge arose because the company only uses one phone number for multiple advisors, leading to confusion and mixed responses whenever I had a question. This inconsistency negatively impacted my overall experience.\n\nWhile my trade-in offer was eventually updated, the communication about the remaining balance was unclear, with conflicting information being provided. I\u2019m giving this service two stars because, although it began on a positive note, great customer service requires consistent communication throughout the entire process, which I did not experience.\n\nI am scheduled to pick up my new Tesla this Saturday, and I\u2019m hoping that everything, including the car and financing, will go smoothly without further issues. I am extremely pleased with having gone in recently. I have been in the market for a new car and have been test driving cars for a few weeks.\n\nFirst off, scheduling a demo with Tesla was so easy online. I was already very impressed by that. I could pick a time that worked for my busy schedule, upload my driver's license and even watch some tutorials to get acquainted with the car. Even more impressive was downloading the Tesla app and learning about all the vast things it offers.\n\nThis showroom is located on one of the busiest streets in Boston but honestly, I parked just fine using metered street parking and if you come prepared it should be just fine. Put 2 hours on your meter in case you stay to talk a while like I did!\n\nWhen I walked in, I was nicely greeted and immediately struck up a conversation with one of their representatives named Aaron.\n\nAaron was a rockstar. He knew the cars so well and asked me questions to help me understand where I was. He helped me prioritize what my needs and wants were and was super motivated to get me the best deal based off of what they had for inventory.\n\nI then took a break to actually test drive a Model 3. It was stunningly impressive from the ground up. Most notable was the quickness of the accelerator and the tug you feel on it. Super exhilarating. Also extremely notable were the Tech aspects. I never fathomed how much went into it. From the full driving autopilot to all the car options being on screen. I even learned that you can prime your car for optimal charging if you set up a charging station as your destination. This decreases how long it will take to charge when you finally get there.\n\nUpon returning, I found Aaron again who helped me understand the potential differences in financing versus leasing, informed me about best practices for wheel maintenance, and helped me understand how to earn the federal tax credit.\n\nHe even open and honestly helped me consider my top gas car pick and wasn't overly pushy about going electric at all. What he really did was inspire me to make going electric possible for me.\n\nAfter all was said and done, I decided to go for a Tesla Model 3 Performance. I am extremely happy I showed up and it all just seemed so right. I am super excited to become a Tesla driver and certainly have a completely new opinion and outlook on the company as a whole. Now it's your turn to hop on!\n\nP.S. Also got to snag a peek at the upcoming Cybertruck. Incredibly futuristic. Perfect location, elegant and classy.\nThe staff is very kind.\nYou are allowed to sit in the car and test everthing.\nThe only think i don't like is that they have on display only one model of Tesla. Solved my problems that were created by their other branch across the street.  They just did their job.   Nice. Nice environment! Food and drink\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d This store is rather janky and questionable at times when it comes to properly disposing of expired products.  barely go to this place due to that. I'm not even an alcohol drinker saying this. Finally made it to this store... nice selection of \"everything\".\nOne of the very rare places that is happy for customers  to break 4 packs of beer to get singles. And what a great selection of craft beers they have!\nThey also have some scotch that I surely don't see (any) everywhere,  and a fair market price.\nHappy to live right next door, and very much recommend this place. Had exactly what I needed! Easy selection and great staff. Just any other store Came here to take a peek, and glad I did. I really enjoyed the NA section as well. I got their cranberry juice today, that was the best I've ever had, what a lovely surprise. I can tell that they have some really nicely curated items. The snacks section is really cute, lots of local products too. They also works w my favorite flower farm (the lovely.. Riddlebrook Farm) and have the flowers and eggs for pick up if you subscribe to their CSA. Oh yeah, this place is the real deal, the items are thoughtful :)  The cashier was really nice too :) Can't wait to try more of their offerings Thanks! Such rude service. Asked for guidance about local wines and the owner (?) gave one word answers to our questions, likely because we were on the younger side and weren\u2019t purchasing very high end products. when we asked where a certain brand was, he simply pointed and didn\u2019t move from his spot behind the counter, even though it took 5 back and forth questions to correctly locate it on the rack. he also refused to give another plastic bag to prevent the wines from ripping through and cracking. will not be back again, although the prices are quite fair. I went strictly for the observatory deck and it did not disappoint! Beautiful sunset views and an amazing inner area to view that was protected from the high winds at the time.\nStill ventures outside to get those shots I was dreaming of on the way down to the PC. (Prudential Center)\nParking was easy. Make sure to get your ticket validated! Much cheaper.\nLots of shopping to do if that's your bag. Otherwise head to the top floor! Whenever I visit this side of the town I always visit here for food clothing or grocery shopping or sometimes just go upstairs and see the great view of Boston. Never had a chance to organize an event here but maybe next time. Always clean and neat, love the maintenance, housekeeping, cleaner or who is in charge of janitors room, spotless and well maintain all the time. Never had any issue so far except the traffic outside. So glad we stopped in to see this place.  Great shopping and food options.  Going up to the View deck was worth every penny.  Love! The Prudential center in Boston is a must-visit for anyone exploring the city. The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking\u2014especially from the Skywalk Observatory, where you get a 360-degree panoramic view of Boston and beyond. It\u2019s the perfect spot to get a bird's-eye view of the city skyline, Fenway Park, and even the harbor on a clear day.\nThe building itself is iconic, and the surrounding area is packed with great shops, restaurants, and attractions. The Prudential Center Mall is a fantastic place to shop, eat, and even catch a movie. The atmosphere is bustling and vibrant, yet the space feels modern and sophisticated. I also appreciate how easy it is to navigate the area, with plenty of public transportation options nearby. Whether you\u2019re visiting for the views or spending the day in the mall, the Prudential Building is a highlight of Boston\u2019s Back Bay. Breathtaking views.  It is quite cold outside even during the summertime. There is plenty of seating outside on the 52nd or 50th floor. Make sure you\u2019re dressed warmly if you\u2019re planning to sit outside. A bit pricey, but fun flavors of chocolates and other sweets!  I love the chocolates with pop rocks inside! Amazingly creative candy store with unprecedented gummy selection and cute chocolate gifts and boxes available.  Superb product.  My favorite: champagne gummie bears. Paid $10 for these gummies and Sugarfina couldn\u2019t even find a way to make them taste decent.\n\nNot sure how you could possibly mess up strawberries and cream, but this company managed to find a way.\n\nHopefully the next boutique shop sells overpriced trinkets instead. As a frequent costumer at Sugarfina Prudential and as someone who\u2019s been a fan of their products I want to make this review only to respond to @Matt Lucido.\n\nSounds like you don\u2019t understand how to leave a proper review. Your issue with the price, and the fact that you didn\u2019t like the flavor of candy you picked out do not reflect poorly on a store location, or its staff. Literally the WORST candy I've ever had in my life and that's not even an exaggeration.\nCandy has one purpose...to be sweet.....these gummies have very little to no flavor or sweetness, I might as well have chewed on plastic. You are truly just paying for presentation. I wouldn't mind paying the overpriced fees for the candy IF it actually tasted like candy. I'm extremely disappointed. I was very excited for the awesome sounding flavors and excited to fulfill my sweet tooth, but I regret spending my money here, I would have been way more satisfied spending $5 for gas station candy. Save your money and get real candy, not this overpriced, plastic tasting, no flavor joke of a gummy bear. This is my review from trying 20 different flavors, I had gotten a bundle in my order, my mistake I should have gotten a tester first, but I genuinely thought it was going to be good candy.\n\nUpdate ; I did send them an email as requested in their reply to my google review (which they were able to respond immediately ) however no further assistance has been provided... again this company is just for show, don't waste your money here My experiences at Pandora in Prudential are always a pleasure! Tia is the person I work with the most and she is such a wonderful professional. I have never had a single problem going into the store. It is always a fun smooth time. Great folks there and professionalism at its best! Ruana and Allysha were super helpful! Store was clean! They customer service is trash and they decided the christmas promo ended to 2 before it actually did. My son when looking for the christmas promo and they say promo was not available no longer......he when to the store in natick mall and promo was available i just don't get why is the lie for I\u2019ve been few times at this store and the sale associates are nice and helpful but the manager is always with an attitude as she owns the store. I wonder if for that reason every visit there\u2019s a new sales associate. I was just there to ask about the new collection and I understand that there\u2019s is a process before to show it to people. Instead of explain me that they need to organize the merch to put it on sale on launch day, she was so rude and told me that they have few stock and that better go to buy online if I want to get them because they might sold out at for time next day. Definitely no going more to that store and I feel it for the people that have to work with her. Horrible experience in Pandora that is in Prudential! I tried to go to the store waiting for them to help me with my bracelet because when I walked my bracelet opened by itself, I had to check every 5 minutes that my bracelet did not open. I was afraid that I would lose it. When I arrived at the store I explained to them what the problem was,\n\nFirst of all, \"the manager\" who was very rude and disrespectful, she told me that she\u2019s not gonna change my bracelet because it was in perfect condition, I tried to explain to her that at first it seems to close well but when I am walking my bracelet opened and fell, she insisted that she\u2019s not gonna change it for a new one because the bracelet is fine, she also told me that it happened because I didn't close it well, I asked her for her name just to talk to customer services and tell them who took care of me and she said that she didn't have to give me her name and she walked away. I was embarrassed by her behavior. She seemed extremely entitled. I was disappointed that this company would allow such representation. Just to mention it, I bought my bracelet 2-3 weeks ago in that store.\nVery bad experience, and unprofessional!\n\nIf you need help, go to another Pandora\u2019s store. I will rather drive to Burlington or Assembly and have great service than to come back to this location.\n\nI went to Pandora in Assembly the same day and they helped me with my bracelet without problem, and they also helped me to find a new charm. Excellent staff! Adriana was very welcoming. She helped me find the most perfect Christmas gift. Her attention to detail and friendly demeanor was exceptional. Thank you! Today went to buy a bracelet for my mom birthday, and there were three bracelets next each other and the price they had in front of them is  $79.  I liked the price, and when I wanted to pay, the cashier told me the price is $129.  And when I told them, how is the price $129 and the one in front of the bracelet is $79? they apologized and told me that the price is only $79 for the other two bracelets. by the way, they were not organizing. It looks like, it\u2019s planed!! My experience at this location was nothing short of perfect. I worked with a young lady, Taneajah, who was pleasant and non-pressured in the search for the perfect ring. Once finished,.she not only educated us about the Boston metro system but walked us to the platform (across the mall) and explained each stop. She then, to my shock, bought my ticket for me! What a consummate professional! I easily made it back to my destination with a beautiful Swarovski ring! Monica and her crew are very\n\n~ Friendly & Respectful Employees were incredibly unfriendly and unwelcoming to the point where I regretted my entire purchase at the store today. No one welcomed us when we entered and ignored us the entire time we were browsing even though there were 4 employees on deck. When the man behind us entered, one of the women at the front counter immediately greeted him and began telling him about special deals. No idea why we weren't given the same treatment. When I made my purchase, the box for the necklace came ripped???? I was so tempted to just return my entire purchase before I even left the Prudential. Do NOT come here. I had a very smooth experience shopping at this Kate Spade location, and the associates were friendly and helpful. We had a pleasant shopping experience here because the associates were welcoming without pressuring customers toward anything in particular. This location happened to have a clearance item I was hoping to find that had sold out online, and in general this store had a wide selection of Kate Spade accessories. I have purchazed 5 Kate Spade bags in the past 3 years. I have never had such a bad experience as I did today May 27th 2024, 2:15pm. I went into the store and none of the store associates greeted me or offered any assistance. I wasn't expecting superb customer experience but I did notice that the store associates greeted all other customers with a friendly smile and offered help. Their eyes were on their phones as I browsed through the store. For a store located at Prudential Center, I was expecting a much better experience. I will certainly not be returning to give them my commission. I have had a much better experience at the New York Flagship location. Maybe I'll just go to Michael Kors next time. I love window shopping at Kate spades. I was a huge fan of hers and was sadden with such a huge loss. She impacted my life a great deal. So I stop in the store at least to see the styles and get extremely upset when I find marks or dirt stains on such beautiful crafted clothing. Yes I am sure to point out what I find and most times the manager is very nice about my findings but some staff members are not.\n\nPlease keep this memory a live that this lady was extremely kind. I've bought from this store several times, but not since the pandemic, never had this feeling before. Don't know if they were put off by my wheelchair or what I was wearing, but there was a definite cool attitude until I started to buy, and then they were more than kind. I don't think I'll be back. This review is based on the customer service, and not the quality of the products.\n\nI really like the brand, so I come here often, sometimes to browse and sometimes to get gifts for my family. I purchased two of the same purse, but ended up having to return one. I brought in the purse and the receipt for return, but the store assistant accidentally refunded me for both purses and didn't know about it at all.\n\nI took sometime debating whether I want to just run with the money, or correct their mistake. As someone who worked in retail before, I felt like this kind of mistake would get the store assistant in trouble, so I went back and told them the truth. She thanked me for the honesty and billed me for one, and that was it.\n\nAs I left the store for the second time, I was disgruntled by the fact that they did not offer anything in return - I was expecting a discount code for my next purchase, to be honest. Then I remembered that when I was initially buying the purses, I had to interrupt the store assistants chatting in order to get any help (it was a few days before Mother's day as well, so you'd think they would care a bit more about selling).\n\nAs a result, I'm not really motivated to shop in this specific location anymore. I'm sure I'd still frequent their website as I love their product, but I can do without the customer service. I went there during the Black Friday weekend on a Sunday. I knew the store opens at 11am. I showed up at the door 5 minutes after and it was still closed. The manager walked by and simply waved a NO sorry indicating they were still closed despite being past the 11am opening time. I came back 5 minutes later and there were a few people outside this time. But the store was still closed. The same lady came over with an attitude saying they were still closed and that maybe they would open in 30 minutes. No apologies given and we were stunned by the lack of customer service skills. Way to turned down customers. Great choices! Ellie was very patient and helpful. Very pleasurable shopping experience. Merchandise was well organized as well! I had a good experience shopping at this store, partly due to the luck of stopping in when there was a large selection of sale and clearance merchandise. The associates were friendly and this was one of the most welcoming Vineyard Vines locations I've visited. Caveat Emptor - buyer beware of this store!!!!  This is the third time in a year of shopping at this same store that full-priced items are on the sale  table when they shouldn't be. When you learn at the register that an item is not on sale and you explain that is where you found it, you are told \"you should have read the fine print - exclusions apply\". Be sure to bring a magnifying glass to be able to read the fine!!!!! (miniscule) print on the sale table sign. I can understand this happening once but three times is suspicious. Either this is a sales tactic or a sign that staff needs to monitor these tables harder to make sure the merchandise is in the right place. Most other stores would absorb the error...and use it as a teaching experience for the staff - not this store.  Ben was condescending when I asked how he would feel if this happened to him as a customer. He told me he reads the fine print. Note to all future customers - read the fine print. I agree with other reviewers - the clothing and shopping experience  are not worth the price of these clothes. Awesome store.  Preppy high quality clothes from New England I was just at the CVS at 800 Huntington Boston, MA and the experience was great\u2026the whole vaccination process was quick and easy!\nI used the app, selected vaccines, and chose which ones, scheduled day and time! Got a notification via SMS and email, checked-in, walked to pharmacy, heard my name and sat in the waiting area, one ahead of me. I got called in, got my vaccinations after pharmacist verified my identity, and was gone less than 10 mins after I walked through the doors. Went to this place a Monday night like 15 minutes before the close, my card didn\u2019t work appropriately and I had to dispute the transaction which left me without a single penny till this amazing coworker came and offered to cover my amount; I was in shock and didn\u2019t see that kindness coming over in that awkward situation; I\u2019m fully Grateful and very satisfied for the service and upon all, that little act of real kindness. Sonia was on duty at the pharmacy. The contrast between her and the other female pharmacist could not be more vivid. Sonia greeted my husband and me in a friendly way. Cory asked what we needed and I explained I am supposed to get easy to open caps on my prescriptions because of arthritis in my hands. Cory took the bottle I had brought but immediately Sonia said \"I can do that!\" and she did in about 10 seconds. She was friendly and helpful and smiled at us. It was a pleasure to spend some time with her. What is with the attitude of employees here? Zahra straight up rolled her eyes when I got in line. The scoff I got when I asked to make a return. You'd think I had asked her something offensive. Definitely not a welcoming place. Excellent customer service and choice of merchandise. Very disappointed with the customer service at Club Monaco. The brownish/blonde sales associate from tis afternoon  was unfriendly and seemed disinterested in helping. When I asked about an item, I was met with a rude tone and zero effort. Overall, it was a terrible shopping experience \u2014 poor attitude, no hospitality, and not welcoming at all. Definitely not coming back. Hi! I will give zero  Star if it\u2019s possible for the poor Quality of material and for the Way the employee treat a customer.I bought a set of pants and sweater. The pant came with a tree small little hole, two weeks after I went back  to the Store and  show it to the employee. He is completely ignored me. I had an unpleasant experience with an employee who claimed to be a manager. They were rude and unhelpful. According to the store's return policy, I was eligible for a return in the form of a gift card. However, the employee insisted that they currently don\u2019t have gift cards available and that I would need to purchase another item instead. How is this place still open - never any customers in the store, ridiculously overpriced for clothes made in china, no staff to be found to assist. Really terrible. This used to be a good place to shop, used to be keyword. Avoid! I really enjoyed my experience here. There was a fairly wide selection of men's clothing, which I appreciated, and a lot of the lines of the clothes are simple, elegant, and classic. Great materials as well! Thank you to everyone at the shop who helped us find things and provide such accommodating service. Would definitely recommend, especially on a sale, like we happened to find! :) I visited the store on Sunday 05/07/23. I was never acknowledged by any of the sales associates. A couple of them looked me directly in my face and walked on by. I initially thought they were customers. I had a couple of items in my hand that I wanted to purchase. After being totally ignored , I decided to go down to Polo Ralph Lauren and purchase a few items. The sales associates immediately greeted me and extended their help willingly. I love to shop at Madewell , but I will never shop at the Prudential Center location again. Chana knows her jeans!!!\nShe helped me finally figure out my fit, which took a while. Liam was also very helpful. I love Madewell and was excited to go to this store since it\u2019s located in the center of Prudential mall but I was barely helped out when asking for an item and when I asked if the closet store could have it the associate I asked did not even try to help in calling to check. She had a rude attitude and made absolutely no effort. I was very disappointed and will remember to only go to the Newbury location when I am in Boston. I cannot speak highly enough of my experience here. Kylie was exceptionally helpful in figuring out a flattering fit and style for my body type and honored a slightly unusual return/exchange. Thank you! Very helpful staff. Friendly. Nice selection of jeans and tops. It's for the casual clothing shopper but there were some cute dressier casual clothing items. Stopped by here after the skywalk observatory. Small but well kept and friendly cashiers. Soft serve ice cream was great although like everything around here a little on the pricey side. But good portions so we split one. The dark chocolate cones weren't all we were hoping them to be but the chocolate ice cream had that signature godiva taste, vanilla not so much (duh). Wonderful people selling extraordinary chocolate. They offer a free samples from a beautiful collection, just apply for the Godiva club, you can do the in the store. Applying won't take a minute.\nBy the way, they have Ice Cream. \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b My friend gave me these Godiva chocolates and I ate one and it didn't taste right. Is this why? Bioengineered food ingredients? I am really surprised at you, Godiva. I thought you had the best chocolate in the world. Not anymore. I'm sorry but they taste cheap & awful. Plenty of better tasting chocolate out there & certainly cheaper....goodbye Godiva, you lost me.. How do you ruin a black friday shopping experience\uff1f Having the world renowned godiva having temp workers providing poor customer experience.  This lady clearly has no clue about serving their soft-serve and worse she knew we are godiva members but failed to ask us for the membership card until after we paid.  What did she say\uff1f \"There is nothing we would do about it.\"  And I am letting google review do the talking. Visited the Prudential Center store yesterday a (few minutes after noon) and the young gentleman working there (unfortunately, I did not catch his name) was a pleasure to meet.  Always refreshing to have a pleasant conversation during these strange times.  He kindly made the very best milk chocolate covered strawberry I have eaten in a very long time.  I cannot thank him enough.  He totally made my day.  I highly recommend this store for a mid-day pick-me-up.\n\nGo get yourself a strawberry or a delicious piece of chocolate. Enjoy! We ordered a bike and the delivery date changed 3 times. When we finally got the bike, it was broken and decided to return it less then a week after we received it. We set up an account with Affirm to make monthly payments and the first payment was taken out. Online it says after they receive the bike it will take up to 14 days to receive our money back. We have pictures of the bike being place on the truck. We have called them asking what the status is in the refund and they said they are having a hard time locating the bike in the warehouse??? We returned the bike back in Feb and it is now 2 months later and nothing has been resolved. Meanwhile, Affirm wants us to pay for a bike we don\u2019t even have. It has been so stressful. I don\u2019t normally write negative reviews but please be aware before you fall into this trap. Highly recommend asking for CHRIS in store. He is a rock star! Helpful and kind. Results driven and will make sure your needs are met. True definition of \"unreasonable hospitality\". Honestly, the whole team in Boston tries to care for Peloton members which is rare in this world. Biggest thank you for being kind! used to love peloton and own a peloton+. But after it was broken within quarantine, I have scheduled three times for it to be fixed. They swapped three parts of the device and was unable to fix it even though the onsite maintenance guy told the customer service his evaluation which was correct. Guess what, his evaluation was never taken seriously and ended up being ignored. In the end, I was forced to return it as they refused to replace the last part of the device with a full refund. Fine. After that I had to schedule pick up for two times and peloton was still unable to send the right amount of crew even the notes clearly said three men needed for peloton+. Nobody called back and find a resolution for me and I have to reach out again to schedule a third time. I love peloton before and was ready to use the refund to purchase a new one. But now I am extremely disappointed and will never use this company's product again. Ordered bike in early October scheduled delivery for November received and email a week before delivery saying it was pushed out a month to December 21st. Fast forward received a confirmation email for delivery on Friday December 18th for delivery on the 21st. Then get an email 15 hours before delivery on the 20th saying the delivery has been delayed further no target timeline. The sales rep here wasn\u2019t nice. Once I mentioned that I\u2019m not local she didn\u2019t even bother to tell the item prices when I asked while stating \u201coh, we don\u2019t ship them to your country.\u201d WOW! Customer care at its best! My husband went to Hammer Made once, got couple of dress shirts, and couldn\u2019t stop bragging about them. He went on and on about the material, it\u2019s good quality and the great price it came with. So for our anniversary, I decided to treat him to couple of dress shirts.I went online, looked for the ones I liked and called this location to have it shipped, since we don\u2019t live in Boston anymore.\nWhen I called I had the great pleasure of talking to Tania. Not only was she nice and friendly, she was more than happy to help out. She took her time to give me the right information and what I needed exactly. Thanks to her I will be getting him a shirt every month, I can\u2019t wait to see what Hammer Made is dropping soon.\nFYI, even their shipping Rocks!!! His shirts came in great condition and not a single wrinkle. Truly, LOVE THEM!!! These shirts make up some staples of my wardrobe. They differentiate themselves from department store offerings with the reversible cuff detailing, colorful buttons and truly unique patterns. Some of the designs are a bit...adventurous but there's always plenty of more conservative designs to choose from. My only gripe is that some of the fabrics they choose tend to wrinkle easily. I was in here Sunday and had the best experience! I worked with Maggie Brennan and she is awesome to work with! She was professional, patient and knows her stuff! I can\u2019t wait to visit Maggie again! Thank you again for making the experience top notch! Suzanne at the prudential center in Boston was excellent. I bought more merchandise than initially intending.    Worth it! quality and fit are excellent! Great selection of quality men's shirts and accessories. I especially ially like their collection of colorful socks! Came in for prescription glasses for my 10YO son. Didn\u2019t want to spend a lot since I figure he\u2019ll need new glasses yearly. Walked in, sales person showed us glasses that fit him well, found a style and color he liked - and it was fashionable! Best part was that the cost was super reasonable! I\u2019m a fan - will be back for my other child when she needs it. A little overdue, but I went back in December to get fitted for 4 new frames. Ximena and her team were incredibly helpful and never made me feel rushed. They took their time to give me feedback and insights on different styles. I also want to note that the staff in the store have decades of experience in the optical industry. Please visit the Warby Parker at the Pru and you won't have any regrets! My friends convinced me that I should check out Warby Parker to get my new glasses. I'm very happy I made the effort to check them out. The have a great selection of frames at reasonable prices. Great service and staff that really make everything easy.\nI recommend that everyone looking for glasses or related services check them out also. You'll be glad you did. I picked out two frames, with the help of Soonia, who helped me decide which frames are best suited for my features. They only took about a week to arrive in the mail, which I appreciated. When they arrived, they needed a small readjustment, which Kimberly provided. Great experience, and I feel like the price was very reasonable, given that I\u2019ve paid more for a single pair at other optometry shops! If you\u2019re visiting this Warby Parker location, be sure to ask for Kimberley! She helped adjust my glasses with incredible attention to detail, and they fit so much better now. Her expertise and friendly demeanor made the experience fantastic. Highly recommend Kimberley and this store! Excellent staff, helpful , professional very knowledgeable explaining features of various  machines.Visited store on national coffee day for a free sample and left with a beautiful machine which we have enjoyed all week at home.Gleb whipped up 2 full size espressos patiently explaining all features of various machines.Jacob was sweet very knowledgeable comparing several features to pinpoint which machine features matched our  preferred coffee preferences, froth,etc. . Outstanding no pressure sale - just enthusiastic energy for a great product line. Very generous amt of variety cups with purchase.They offered to stamp our parking pass for a credit at Prudential center which was a nice gesture .So happy we meandered in for approx 35 min,they never rushed us.,Jacob/Gleb made it a fun experience!! The coffee to go bar is inconsistent with their offering. I ordered the exact same large drink 24 hours apart and one was 16 ounces and the next day it was 8. They need better training to provide consistency. I think this place gets a bad rap. I went on a Sunday afternoon. Was it busy? Yes. Was there an online queue? Yes. However, we were welcome to wait in the store and browse before being setup with a great Nespresso agent, Nick, after a quick wait. He helped us taste some brews and recommended his favorites. He only has three varieties to try, which was disappointing, but overall it was a good experience. I\u2019m not going to line up for 20 minutes to buy coffee sleeves, Nespresso. It\u2019s coffee! Do whatever you want to fancy it up, but lines? 20 minute wait? I\u2019ve purchased sleeves at other locations before and it takes all of 5 minutes to get the transaction done. There\u2019s no reason I need to wait that long in a line to give you MY money for coffee pods. This store always has operational and management issues. You always have to wait here. Every other Nespresso store in the US and in Europe has figured out how to get people in and out fast, meanwhile Prudential  would have 4 people working and still ask people to wait for 20 mins to walk in and purchase capsules.\n\nNote to management : it\u2019s a very easy fix. Just set up 1 person to do degustations, 1 person to sell coffee sleeves and 2 people to sell machines. Then you won\u2019t have these stupid queues and poor customer experience.\n\nAlso fix the text message system for waiting in line. So that people don\u2019t have to waist there time in the store. Avoid this location. We\u2019re poorly treated tonight by an employee who I believe was the store manager, or at least she acted like she was and in a bad way. We got into the store a couple minutes before 8:00pm. We were asked what we wanted to see and my daughter was interested in a fleece coat. While she was being helped by this individual, my wife asked another sales person about a coat on the a hanger. This other sweet and professional sales associate was all about helping my wife with her questions and trying on the coat she was looking at. At this point the \u201cmanager\u201d who was still helping my daughter approached us and said they were closed and basically said they could not help us and that we should come back tomorrow! \u201cDoes taht make sense to you guys?\u201d I said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d. \u201cEither you\u2019re closed and we have to go, or we\u2019re in the store and you\u2019ll help us. What is it going to be\u201d her reply was that we could get the fleece but nothing else. The other sales associate was horrified by her response. It took forever for us to pay as the cashier was really slow. It\u2019s worth mentioning that there were other 4-5 shoppers still shopping and taking their time in the store. At least 2 were still in when we left. So you pay through the nose for a fleece and you\u2019re about to spend a little fortune on a coat, and you\u2019re still treated poorly and like garbage. If that person is in fact a manager, she is not  the right brand representative nor a good example to the other employees. If she\u2019s just a poorly trained employee, than the store manager should pay attention to training their employees better, if they really care about the \u201cright experience\u201d, whatever taht it, because waht we experienced was totally the wrong experience. Just in case, shop at another CG store, or be there when the store open, otherwise you\u2019ll probably get the same experience as we did! Went here to shop for a gift. Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from, all of the staff I worked with were very helpful and polite. I didn\u2019t feel rushed at all to make a decision. There was a wait of less than 5 minutes because the store was packed around the holidays. Seemed to be a good selection of products, although many were stored in the back, and there was a walk in freezer to test them out. Was of course pricey, but it was overall a great store. Would definitely come back if I were shopping for this brand again. Initially, I was thinking just to buy online since 1hr drive. But I ended up going to store to physically try on the size and type. Staff-Rakeem?! (I forgot to ask his name so using the sale name on my receipt \ud83d\ude2c)He was incredibly kind and efficient, helping me find the right size and parka type. I highly recommend seeking him out if you want a great shopping experience at this store. Jules was incredibly thoughtful, helpful and sweet. She helped me pick out my Shelburne Parka and applauded me for being unique and going for the lucent rose vs the black. If you are going to this store I would recommend asking for her, you will also leave the store with a smile. Usually I have had a decent experience at the store except their usual waiting period, some times of an hour (to get into the store!!) Last time I went to exchange a coat (size issues) and I had the worst possible experience. The manager (a white lady) was super rude. I had to carry my coat back home because I had fogotten my coat tag, but there are polite ways of telling a customer to do that. She was rude, and dismissive in her behaviour. Since it was an exchange/ return, I didn\u2019t have a choice but to get the tag but she very rudely refused to even hold that coat for that period. My friend, who was accompanying me and I have decided, NEVER to visit the Canada Goose store in Prudential. Extremely extremely rude staff, the girls are very stuck up acting like they own the place, was trying on 4 items in the fitting room and didn\u2019t like any of them so I was waiting to hand them back and the girl working in the fitting kept looking over at me and rolling her eyes, waited 5 minutes and she gave me the most attitude and snarky response \u201cYou don\u2019t want ANY of that?!\u201d Like no lol I do not :) so please just take my clothes and hang them up. Mind you it was only 4 items, she is getting mad at doing her job. Please hire better staff The staff go above and beyond when shopping here, remembering customer names, finding the right sizes, etc. I have such a great shopping experience here every time. One employee in particular, Tim Mayo, was there at every step of the stressful decision of what jeans fit the best. I left the store, with a bag full of items that fit perfectly. Seriously best shopping experience ever. Absolutely wonderful staff and great selection.\n\nI came in to buy a suit and walked out with exactly that. Staff were very quick to help and were unbelievably friendly\u2014which can be sometimes rare in retail (coming from a former retail employee).\n\nWe were helped by Vanessa who was very proactive in offering her advice on pieces that would work. She was creative and a pleasure to chat with.\n\nThe girls who checked us out at the register were also wonderful.\n\nUgh just 10/10, Prudential Aritzia! Absolutely nailed it! One star driven almost entirely by the return process - I've been trying to get this store on the phone for 2w because they require a phone call to process a return (who does that??) In the interim you have to answer dumb questions such as 'why did you buy these pants?' - I understand they need it for their marketing algo but it creates a terrible customer experience. Skip Aritzia. What a lovely group of people\u2014immaculately dressed. Especially one of the managers, Anna! Very rare to see so many people wanting to be kind and helpful. This place has everything. John was so helpful (along with the other staff), and helped me pick out some sharp looking professional and leisure outfits. He got my fitting perfect as well. Felt like I didn\u2019t have to do much - just showed up, said my basic preferences, and they took care of the rest. Will definitely be back. Manny was very helpful and patient with me as I sorted through half a dozen different pairs of pants. I had a great experience in the store, but didn\u2019t buy anything on the spot. However, I received an email immediately after, with all the items I tried on. I found this helpful so that I could take my time and sleep on my decisions. The in-store experience seemed friendly when I first went to check out this store. Darren, Alex, Allison were all helpful with showing me around the small store, explaining the style options, and getting clothes for me to try on.\n\nThis isn't your typical store where you can just buy what you want and leave with your clothes. All of the clothes in the store is just for people to try on. They don't have every style, color, and size, so you may end having to try a different style or color than you want to see. They only have one of each style and color on display and you have to ask an employee to get the size you want to try on, which may be in a different style or color. Then, you place your order and wait for the delivery to arrive in the mail. This seemed fine at first, until I received my order. That's when I realized that the quality of the clothes is not the same. Both pairs of jeans had the same dye issue in my order. There was a dark stain on the bottom hem of both pairs. The sizing was also inconsistent and there was about an inch difference in the same length jeans.\n\nReturning in the store was easy. The customer service was less friendly compared to browsing and purchasing, but it was efficient. However, because of this lengthy process just to find out the clothes aren't the same quality, I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle. Dyrelle is by far the BEST!! I\u2019ve been a loyalcustomer of Bonobos for a very long time and he went above and beyond to make sure that I was taken care of. I will be back again and again to see him! Staff is always quick to offer help, really good about sizing and offering opinions and generally pleasant to be around.\n\nBeen a Bonobos customer for a long time. Being able to try stuff on here, and always having a good experience doing so is part of why I keep coming back. This is a very large store with two floors, but there is also a lot of empty space. I'm not sure how they choose what to carry and what not to carry but I could not find all the clothes I wanted to look at in person in the store. When I asked about looking for clothes with a zippered pocket, the staff said there were none. Walking around, I found what I was asking about, so the staff doesn't seem trained to be knowledgable about their products. Part of the reason I shop in store is to get assistance with finding clothes to try on, so this wasn't a great experience. There were no issues with returning items or making purchases however. Zero service. I came to the store when there were no customers there. The sellers were talking in the corner near the cash register and no one wanted to come up to me and help with a choice. I had to ask the girl who moved away from this group and went past me. I needed to buy training gloves. She led me to a stand where all the gloves were thrown into a pile, and NOT hung neatly, as is customary in a store. From the pile, I found one glove that fit me. The salesperson quickly dug out another glove from the pile and said it was the second one. In the end, when I paid for the purchase and went home, I discovered that they had sold me two gloves for right hand. This is my worst experience of making a purchase from this brand Great store and helpful staff.  Love most of their gear. Have bought lots and will prob buy more.  But on this occasion have to give a low rating bc not all are well manufactured.  See pictures.  The track pants I bought 2 months ago. There was a -tiny- thread at the top of the pocket that got caught on my nail as I pulled hand out and it left this large line across one side of the front.  The track top has magnetic closure that don\u2019t work anymore - had this top for leas than a year. Really nice stuff.  Store is clean. So much to see. Most recent visit: April 2022:\n\nYour kindness, professionalism and hospitality shown to me and my family knew no limits; bashful and in complete awe that this extreme level of service still exists today, my arms, heart and mind could just barely receive all of your graciousness. See you all again soon!\n\nAlways a destination on a Boston visit! The store is a giant, fully on glam UA house with insane visuals and of course premium UA gear!  Two stories of Women / Men / Children's all under one roof. Jamie did an amazing job with my layers! The service was truly exceptional, and I truly appreciated her suggestions\u2014they made all the difference. The final cut turned out even better than I imagined. My hair feels and looks fantastic! Highly recommend Jamie to anyone looking for a great haircut and professional service. I recently had my hair styled by Jamie, and she did an amazing job! She listened to exactly what I wanted and delivered perfectly. Jamie gave me the perfect layered hair with super cute bangs. She also provided some really helpful hairstyle tips that I can use daily. Highly recommend her services! This was my first time visiting the salon! I was here for a haircut and Wes did an amazing job with my hair giving me great looking layers\ud83e\udd29 I'd recommend getting your hair done by Wes cuz she's truly sweet. Jamie was super amazing for my haircut and blowout! I have curly/wavy hair, and was nervous about losing too much of my length when getting layers, but she was super understanding and listened to everything I wanted and executed it perfectly. She was also super sweet and fun to talk with the whole time as well! Overall, could not have had a better experience and I\u2019m very happy with my hair! :) I had such a great experience with Jamie at the salon! From the start of my visit to the end! Jamie took the time to ask me exactly what I wanted before we got started, and I showed her some pictures for inspiration. She absolutely nailed it! I asked for long layers and face-framing pieces, and she delivered exactly what I envisioned. Not only is she super talented, but she\u2019s also so sweet and friendly. The head massage during my wash was the cherry on top! Highly recommend Jamie! Great customer service!! I wish the store was in our state as well because for the first time parents you really need someone who will advice you wisely.\nI wrote them an email asking for a stroller advice and they answered immediately!! We set up a consultation through the phone with Stephanie and she was very helpful, thank you so much! Thank you for Videos in YouTube they are my favorite. I never been in the store, but I think magic beans doing awesome remote service. IDK how this store gets low reviews, if you need BuyBuy Baby, Target or Amazon scale, shop there. As as a first timer I was clueless about essentials: strollers, car seats, carriers etc. The staff spent SO much time walking me though models, demoing & answering questions - on numerous occasions, before I spent a dime. That kind of customer service and attention doesn't exist at other places - and they don't even work on commission. They also so hold summer sidewalk sales at mad discount. This has become my baby gear education spot. Have called multiple locations and always ridiculously helpful!  Small selection compared to big box stores, BUT trustworthy and high quality.  I\u2019m a convert to the point that I call to order my things instead of shopping online.  Where else can you call/go and say I want XYZ... and they actually have an educated answer. Great customer service.\nI called them to ask some info and place the order through the phone, with reasonable price plus some discounts.And free shipping without charging sales tax when purchase outside of the MA~ NICE! It's not a large space yet they try to have toys, clothing and baby items. This leads to a Very limited selection of a bunch of things. They are too small to be ToysR us and shouldn't try to be. Immediately kindly greeted by lovely ladies. As busy as they were, they still took me as a walk in and Jolia did outstanding on my nails. She did a perfect chrome gel x french tip, and  made sure there were no flaws with my set. My first experience at MiniLuxe and I will now be switching to here! Edit: Downgraded my rating to 1* because I broke out in an itchy rash everywhere the massage oil was used on my neck and back.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nReally disappointing gel manicure/nail art and shoulder/neck massage. The gel manicure ended up on my fingers and cuticles and the nail art turned out badly (see attached pictures for what I asked for vs. what I got). The entire appointment lasted under 45 mins and cost ~$100 before tip. Don\u2019t go to Miniluxe, it\u2019s a waste of money for disappointing results. I had a really awful experience. I reserved a gel polish with French tip. First off my technician didn\u2019t even know I wanted a French tip, and then didn\u2019t buff my nails or trim properly and brutalized my fingers, I actually bled a little after service. She rushed and was staring off in the distance the entire time like she didn\u2019t want to be there which made me really uncomfortable and didn\u2019t put enough layers into the gel or any care into the French tip which made it bubble up at the tips and soak deep under my nails. And then at the end she took a filer and coarse filed my tips which broke the seal and made them crack open. For 70$ (I didn\u2019t even get extensions or anything)  this is horrendous and I was even given attitude when I didn\u2019t tip according to expectation at the end. Never coming back. I recently had the pleasure of getting my nails done by Jolia for the Lunar New Year, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results! Jolia is incredibly talented and created the most adorable and intricate Lunar New Year designs.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and comfortable. Jolia is friendly, professional, and clearly passionate about her work. I gave her creativity freedom to do her own design on my nails.\n\nThe entire experience was relaxing and enjoyable. Jolia's attention to detail is impeccable, and my nails look stunning. I'm already planning my next visit!\n\nI highly recommend booking with Jolia! You won't be disappointed. Jolia did an amazing job! I got shot gel x nails with mirror chrome and they turned out great!! Definitely will be coming back Great store! The staff are super friendly and helped us choose some dope shades. They also did a very great job of dealing with a HORRIBLE customer when we were in there yesterday. This lady refused to back away from other customers, and started yelling at the Oakley employees, but they did a great job defusing the situation while ensuring the safety of themselves and their other customers. Very impressed with their tact and professionalism. I needed help with my choices for prescription lens frames. I was sure I knew what I wanted online but I needed to try before I buy. I walked in and the main employee Christian was nothing less than spectacular in helping me with reccomdations and great customer service. Had my order delivered at the store for pick up and my package was opened when I arrived. You don\u2019t open people\u2019s packages without their consent and apparently the sale assistant took off my glasses and took at look, otherwise how could she notice my name was engraved on it. Not sure if this is how this store works but not my preferred process. Store closed with sign, \"be back in 20 minutes\" in the window. Mind you this was around noon. Waited for 45 minutes and nobody showed.  Tried to call, got no answer. This after I paid to park and walked almost a mile one way. I needed to order new prescription glasses. Honestly thank you for the exercise, but I wont be spending any money in your store now. The gentleman that helped me at the store was extremely helpful and professional. I purchased two custom frame and color configurations and I love them both. Oakley is on fire as simple as that. Purchased The Sullivan coat in Dec 2024. Zipper on it was acting up from the beginning, and now completely stuck. Verified with another friend who has the same coat that this is a known issue. Contacted the Madison Store for assistance and was told to go online and request repairs. Repair process requires photos of front, back, damaged area, receipts, and my first born. After all said and done in submitting, Jacket has to be sent to them and I will know in a month or two what they can do, if anything. The store states \"they cannot do anything and even though they seem like a big company, they are still very small\" What does this even mean???? $1,500 for a coat and two months later in the dead of winter I have to waste time to send it back and wait for a maybe we can fix it????? NO LONGER A FAN AND WILL NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS BRAND. ZERO STARS IF I COULD. Great experience! Gilson the salesman and Jess the Manager are both super sweet, professional and attentive to their customers! I was finally able to buy my daughter an Adali F Mackage Coat for her birthday and she loves it!! Thank you for great customer service! My wife bought a padding about a month ago and the feathers keep coming out. The stores wont exchabge it. They acknowledged that it is a defect but they say you have to do it through internet.\nWhy would anyone buy it through store if they are not going to take care of it.\n\nThey wont exchange it and they wont refund it.\nWhat a joke The store and the team are awesome! I had a great experience with Chris, he is super efficient and customer centric. I got things done quickly and accurately. The coats are adorable and warm. Definitely go there and check out the products! I had to buy a last minute gift on Christmas Eve and Chris the store manager was the most down to earth sales associate I\u2019ve come across. Chris was helpful and knowledgeable. Chris was able to precisely determine what size coat I should buy based off of a picture of my boyfriend. Goodbye Canada Goose hello MACKAGE! I had an amazing experience at Sephora thanks to Emily G. She was incredibly knowledgeable about the products and helped me find exactly what I needed. Her recommendations were spot on, and she took the time to explain how to use everything. I really appreciated her patience and friendly attitude. If you're looking for someone who truly knows their stuff and cares about helping you, Emily G is the one to ask for. Thank you for making my shopping trip so enjoyable! Very nice clean Sephora , attentive staff, good choice of perfumes, skin care, and make up. Black Friday. The store was packed, costumers were acting like savages and the staff was impecable. They were so attentive, helpful even though they had to keep the store tidy, carry big boxes, big carts to replace products in the shelves, they were extra nice, extra helpful. Very competent. I could see how exhausted they were, with all the costumers asking questions, almost jumping on them (some were extremely rude, specifically the pre-teens group) and the staff handled it very well.\nI truly hope that the store gives them double PTO after the Black Friday craziness. The Sephora located in Boston's Prudential Center is a spacious store offering an extensive selection of cosmetic products, from lipsticks to fragrances. The knowledgeable and friendly staff are always eager to assist customers. I stopped here for a quick shopping. I got what I wanted to buy. They have many brands. Great for the younger generation especially. I got a good service! The young sales lady was very knowledgeable and super helpful. She answered for all my questions and concerns. Every Polo boutique that we have ever visited has been drop-dead gorgeous inside, and this location in Boston is no exception. The sales reps were great. They loved our dog! Walked out with a nice pair of shorts. Overall, we had a great experience! Peter Gaynor was helpful and made you feel welcome. What I liked about the store was how organized it was. The quality is great, and the price point is flexible for everyone. I would highly recommend it if you are getting a gift, traveling, or need to add a classic piece to your wardrobe. Bought a pair of men's winter gloves for $100. After just 3 weeks the stitches opened and I had holes. I take good care of my things and did not abuse them, hardly even used them. Quality is no different from cheap Chinese rip-off products. Sadly, I threw my receipt and can't return them. We visit Boston often and I will say this is one of the WORST stores at the Prudential Center.  The associates do not greet you when you walk in and will say nasty comments under their breathe as you walk by.  I've never experienced such bad behavior in a store.  You will get better service at Target before you get one here.  So glad I didn't waste my money at this location.  If you want Ralph Lauren, go to the one on Newbury St.  the employees are super friendly at this location AND they don't judge how you look when you go shopping.  Never judge a book by it's cover should be taught to the employees at the Prudential Center. Nice store and all, but one of the female associates is too busy with her iPad. Went up to her and asked if a certain item was in stock, got an immediate no and a blank stare. Never offered to check online or anything else (even though she was on her iPad for so long?); my mom and I who were willing to spend money felt so disgusted as we have been loyal customers at Ralph Lauren for 20+ years. To add insult to injury as we left the sales associate went up to a coworker stared into his eyes lovingly and immediately began flirting with him. I get it- customers are clearly not her priority. I went strictly for the observatory deck and it did not disappoint! Beautiful sunset views and an amazing inner area to view that was protected from the high winds at the time.\nStill ventures outside to get those shots I was dreaming of on the way down to the PC. (Prudential Center)\nParking was easy. Make sure to get your ticket validated! Much cheaper.\nLots of shopping to do if that's your bag. Otherwise head to the top floor! Whenever I visit this side of the town I always visit here for food clothing or grocery shopping or sometimes just go upstairs and see the great view of Boston. Never had a chance to organize an event here but maybe next time. Always clean and neat, love the maintenance, housekeeping, cleaner or who is in charge of janitors room, spotless and well maintain all the time. Never had any issue so far except the traffic outside. So glad we stopped in to see this place.  Great shopping and food options.  Going up to the View deck was worth every penny.  Love! The Prudential center in Boston is a must-visit for anyone exploring the city. The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking\u2014especially from the Skywalk Observatory, where you get a 360-degree panoramic view of Boston and beyond. It\u2019s the perfect spot to get a bird's-eye view of the city skyline, Fenway Park, and even the harbor on a clear day.\nThe building itself is iconic, and the surrounding area is packed with great shops, restaurants, and attractions. The Prudential Center Mall is a fantastic place to shop, eat, and even catch a movie. The atmosphere is bustling and vibrant, yet the space feels modern and sophisticated. I also appreciate how easy it is to navigate the area, with plenty of public transportation options nearby. Whether you\u2019re visiting for the views or spending the day in the mall, the Prudential Building is a highlight of Boston\u2019s Back Bay. Breathtaking views.  It is quite cold outside even during the summertime. There is plenty of seating outside on the 52nd or 50th floor. Make sure you\u2019re dressed warmly if you\u2019re planning to sit outside.

Never had a chance to organize an event here but maybe next time. Always clean and neat, love the maintenance, housekeeping, cleaner or who is in charge of janitors room, spotless and well maintain all the time. Never had any issue so far except the traffic outside. So glad we stopped in to see this place.  Great shopping and food options.  Going up to the View deck was worth every penny.  Love! The Prudential center in Boston is a must-visit for anyone exploring the city. The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking\u2014especially from the Skywalk Observatory, where you get a 360-degree panoramic view of Boston and beyond. It\u2019s the perfect spot to get a bird's-eye view of the city skyline, Fenway Park, and even the harbor on a clear day.\nThe building itself is iconic, and the surrounding area is packed with great shops, restaurants, and attractions. The Prudential Center Mall is a fantastic place to shop, eat, and even catch a movie. The atmosphere is bustling and vibrant, yet the space feels modern and sophisticated. I also appreciate how easy it is to navigate the area, with plenty of public transportation options nearby. Whether you\u2019re visiting for the views or spending the day in the mall, the Prudential Building is a highlight of Boston\u2019s Back Bay. Breathtaking views.  It is quite cold outside even during the summertime. There is plenty of seating outside on the 52nd or 50th floor. Make sure you\u2019re dressed warmly if you\u2019re planning to sit outside. My wife did some shopping here and she was impressed by the selection and service. I couldn't find anything to wear here, but then again, I'm not in their target demographic. ;) Great store outlet with loads of variety\n\nToo overstocked so looks a bit tired\n\nGreat service with lovely ladies\n\nWould shop here anytime. But be prepared to rummage a tad. BYOB to get to see the attachment file of your website is the only one I am going out for you are interested please send the Great selections, nice people however, the store was a complete mess. Can usually find a good sale item here. This location is so much friendly than the one on Newbury - I had an issue with a pair of leggings and Alisha at this location was SO helpful and kind. She was also super knowledgeable about the different products and sizing. Really was grateful to have her help today! After talking to the first store associate I ran into, I was about ready to walk back out. When she asked me if I needed help, I said yes I\u2019d appreciate that because I didn\u2019t know my size since I tended to wear off brand leggings. She just snickered at me.\n\nMaddie on the other hand was wonderful in helping me find the perfect pair of leggings. She is the reason I\u2019m leaving a five star review. She was super patient and kind even though I didn\u2019t know my size. I never felt embarrassed when talking to her, and it seemed like she genuinely wanted to help me. I appreciate all of her help and kindness, and I ended up leaving with my new favorite pair of leggings that fit perfectly! Had a so-so experience. I was greeted and offered service quickly, store was clean. The strange part was at the checkout. My husband grabbed two shorts for himself and a pair for me. He gave the sales girl his first responder id and she said in a not-so-clear and rude way that the discount was just for him. All the meanwhile disregarding my presence completely. We didn\u2019t know what she meant and realized she only discounted his items and not mine. I find it odd that a husband can\u2019t buy his wife items and that the sales person was awkward and invasive. If this very bizarre policy holds true then provide some training to the employees so they can communicate your policy without offending people\u2019s spouses. the store was clean and well kept however not all the employees were the nicest. One of the two employees at the dressing room was super sweet and kind but the other was not the kindest. However when another lady who came in from out of the country and was buying many things she was super kind, helpful, and talkative to her. Additionally I went to exchange leggings for another style and size and the tag said 98. However the checkout rang up 118 and I said the tag said 98 and she said they mistagged it and that was the price. I ended up just getting a tank. The next day I went to the newbury lululemon and they were the kindest. They told me lululemon has to honor the price tag and they were sorry that happened. I highly recommend going to the lululemon on newbury. It is 2 mins away from the prudential one, nicer people and a bigger store. Today I was accused by the manager of this Lululemon location of producing a fraudulent receipt to return clothes that I bought on the Lululemon website. He refused to allow the return, cited a \"company policy\" that you can't return over x number of items but refused to tell me what that number was, and suggested that I produced fake email receipts as well as a fake paper receipt. Afterwards, when I went to the location on Newbury to do the return I had no issues. Unrelated, but I will also add that I watched him help another customer evade tax law by putting the tax on a gift card. I know this all sounds ridiculous because it was and it is entirely the truth. My girlfriends and I do a shopping trip downtown every year. We went to two departments, winter jackets and jeans and we spent a lot of $$ and time.\n\nThe associates were helpful but the overall experience was lacking which I blame on management/corporate. Instead of the exceptional experience I\u2019ve had in the past, I felt like my business was taken for granted.\n\nFor example, when we asked for water we were told they didn\u2019t have any and to go over to Shaws across the street. Not only did we not want to leave the store but I assume they wouldn\u2019t want us to leave either. Even if we didn\u2019t buy stuff there should be water for patrons especially on a Saturday during the holidays at a prime location in the city. This lack of attention to detail is one example that negatively impacted our overall experience. I used to work retail for years and this is a small detail but unacceptable. This once luxurious experience fell flat. I recently went to Saks Fifth to buy Chanel makeup. I wanted to get advice and have a consultant help me.\nThe consultant was rude and condescending. I would have been better to order the products on Amazon. Next time I will! Do not trust Saks! I ordered $450 Gucci slides and received a counterfeit pair from their Boston store. Neither the store nor customer service cared or offered any reasonable solution. I am so disappointed and once resolved, will never do business with this company. My initial foray into Saint Laurent was nothing short of extraordinary, thanks to the impeccable service provided by sales associate Jarred. From the moment my husband and I stepped into the store, Jarred's extensive knowledge of the brand's products was evident. His enthusiasm and passion for the craftsmanship and design of each item elevated our shopping experience, as he effortlessly guided us through the collections, offering invaluable insights that ensured we were well-informed about our potential purchases.\n\nWhat truly set Jarred apart was his genuine and welcoming demeanor. His friendly approach made us feel not just like customers, but valued guests. Jarred took the time to understand our preferences and style, tailoring his recommendations to our tastes. His warmth and sincerity, combined with his expertise, created a comfortable atmosphere that made the entire shopping process enjoyable and stress-free. It was evident that Jarred wasn't just selling products; he was cultivating a positive and personalized experience for us.\n\nJarred's professionalism and attention to detail were equally commendable. He patiently addressed all our queries, providing thorough explanations and thoughtful suggestions. His dedication to ensuring we made informed decisions showcased a level of service that went above and beyond our expectations. Leaving the store, my husband and I not only departed with our carefully chosen purchases but also with a newfound admiration for the Saint Laurent brand, largely fueled by Jarred's outstanding service. We eagerly anticipate our next visit, confident that our future engagements with Jarred will be as delightful and rewarding as this inaugural experience.

Surprised to see negative reviews on here! I\u2019m visiting Boston for a few days, and saw that there was a Shinola store near my hotel - they\u2019ve carried my favorite journal for years, but had discontinued my favorite color. Just for the heck of it I took a peak on the website and saw that it was back! So I was on a mission when I walked in and was so happy to see the oat colored journals! I was given a warm welcome from all three employees - Christian, Logan, and Sara(h?). I also had a pen refill that I was unsure if it would fit with any of their pens, and they were more than happy to give it a try! Great environment and staff. I gave my son-in-law  the Shinola Canfield Model c56 Eye Chrono 43 mm in Blue for a gift.  He loved the metal band.  It broke after a month and Shinola send thoughts and prayers and told us we were Shinola-outa-luck.  I didn't get it in the Boston Store to be clear but one can't leave a review on the main web page. I delivered my watch to the Boston store, and it had to be sent to Detroit for repairs. I specifically asked for it to be returned to the store. The next day I returned and asked for those instructions to be confirmed. I was assured it was. My watch was not returned to the store but to my apartment, which is not secure. Now it\u2019s at a UPS location that I will have to track down. Extremely inconvenient!!\u2019 No one greeted me at the store.  I asked to see a piece of jewelry, and then later asked to purchase it.  They didn't have any more in stock at the store, and asked if I wanted to order it.  Because I intended it for a gift that I needed that day, I asked if I could purchase the display, at a discount.  The associate went to the manager, who (in a loud voice) said how no, of course they couldn't do that and made it sound like an idiotic request.  I didn't get the option to buy the display, even at full price. I said, I'll just order it online myself, and they said \"but you get free 2-day shipping\" when you order in-store.  BTW, you get 2 free-day shipping when you order online.  So yeah. Love the brand but terrible shopping experience, I\u2019ve bought two watches and a belt from the prudential store both times the experience was great. I had the same sales women both times and left very pleased with the experience. She went as far as to let me see how her watch size looked on me (was comparing sizes). Highly recommend! Unfortunately can\u2019t see how to put a 0* review!\n\nNothing to do with the store or brand but more to do with a sales person.\n\nWe entered the shop on the 10 April around 18:45 and were looking around and the sales person was in the middle of the room and did not ask if we needed help (the shop was empty and tiny).\n\nMy son asked a question and the sales person offered a very basic reply (nothing rude yet), giving us the impression that he had no desire to assist us or didn\u2019t even want to do a sale!\n\nMy wife wanted a particular style of sun glasses (not prescription glasses) and my son asked again.\n\nThis time he directed us to go to an optometrist as they might have what we wanted. He obviously didn\u2019t want to work as the shop was barely 16 m2 and all this time he didn\u2019t even move towards us to see if he could help.\n\nWe weren\u2019t enjoying the experience but my wife wanted her glasses. She then saw a pair of glasses (not cheap\u2026 over US$1,000) and she wanted to buy them.\n\nWe again asked a question and he was rude. This time he touched all my buttons. He even told us we might be better shopping in another shop.\n\nI asked for his name and he refused to give it to me.\n\nI told him he was rude and a disgrace to the retail industry and he should consider moving to a job that that was not customer interacting. My son demanded his name as by now he was even ruder and he didn\u2019t give it. We then took a picture of him as he was borderline racist and was very offensive (when we left we deleted the picture from our phone but not his image from our mind).\n\nA person telling you constantly to shop somewhere else and showing no interest in selling should get a back office job as he is a disgrace to the industry and to the brand he represents.\n\nLater on my conclusion was that he was racist as we are people of Indian origin.\n\nWe managed to spend over US$1500 in glasses at another store thanks to his referral that we go to another store!!\n\nBy the end he had even asked us to leave HIS shop!!! I informed him he didnt own the shop and was merely an employee of the establishment and me as a businessman was feeling bad for the owners he was representing working there. Dina and Nick were extremely helpful in handling an issue with a missing shipment. They went above and beyond to resolve my concern and make my day! I will definitely continue to shop with this team at Prudential Center! Terrible customer experience due to rude and  pushy employees. I came into the store to browse sunglasses and the Asian male employee asked me which sunglasses I liked, I told him that I\u2019m still browsing. He told me that I can browse on the website and shouldn\u2019t come into the store to just browse. I left the store because I didn\u2019t feel welcome to continue shopping there anymore. I had ordered new sunglass lenses to the Newbury St location but they were unable to replace them in store. I was told to go to a different location down the street, but ended up here by my own error. However, the associate working at the time, Dina, was incredibly kind and helped me by replacing the lenses. She made sure that I wasn't in a hurry and cleaned my sunglasses very thoroughly when she was done. Thanks Dina! tldr amazing 10/10 experience with Dina today \ud83e\udd0d\n\nDina helped me buy a new pair of Chanel sunglasses at Boston\u2019s prudential location this afternoon. She was incredibly friendly and professional, recommended and explained the protection plan in detail, and was overall super attentive and helpful the whole time i was in store. Thank you Dina!! :) Worst customer service.  Shop keeper offered more excuses to why they could not help than solutions.  I received a scarf as a Christmas gift with all the original packaging and I wanted to exchange to another color.  Without any discussion, I was told the company policies are very strict that without the original receipt they could not entertain any exchange.  This is after Christmas, does the company never deal with exchanges?  The fact was that the shop keeper\u2019s attitude drives any customers away.  I certainly will not want to shop with this company.  It is a beautiful scarf, but it is a shame that I will not wear it because it is the wrong color.  I questioned what is the company mission? Do customers mean anything? Worst customer service ever experienced online.  And there\u2019s no official company web site to post reviews to, so posting here.\nA dress ordered on 9/24 has failed to deliver after more than 2 weeks.  It took 1 full week just to get this product to the shipper.  Then the delivery date kept changing. The most recent tracking indicates delivery 3 WEEKS from my order date!  Sadly, this is not the first or fourth such experience with Johnny Was.\nCustomer Service at Johnny Was does not exist: phone calls go unanswered, reps have no accountability and no authority to do anything.  My email STILL has NO response to my delivery dilemma.\nThis is a horrible business to deal with: 1) Product is hit or miss regarding quality and size; 2) The cost is exceptionally high; 3) There is no customer Service to help at all or in any meaningful way; 4) Return policies are limited and inflexible; 5) Brick & mortar stores do not carry most of the items, so you are unable to try or see an item before buying it, and then you cannot return it if it is a sale item; 6) Overall customer experience with this business is dismal.\nHighly recommend shopping elsewhere. Came specifically because of this store. Closes in front of my nose at 13:30. Come back tomorrow. What a weird work schedule????? Of course I won\u2019t be back, it\u2019s so disrespectful to customers and their time (((((( Drove all the way in from worcester(45 mins away), paid 20$ to parkin garage\nStore was CLOSED at 5 pm even though its own website says open until 8.\nCalled Phone number : mailbox is full..\nno wonder in-store shopping is dying.. Interesting selection and helpful service! I've been placing orders with this store since 2020 after our local L'Occitane closed. The manager at the time reached out to me because I was a regular at the store in Garden City , RI. I became a regular ordering gifts for friends and buying my steady line up of creams, soaps and oils. Up until my last order the customer service has been exemplary! I've had so many memorable experiences with this store and all the staff over the years. I left another review years ago that you may be able to still find online. They really seemed like they cared about you and they always stood behind their product if something went wrong. Last time I ordered I dealt with the new manager. I noticed a difference right away in her tone and manner. She fulfilled my order but not with the special touches that existed before. Today I called up and after the phone rang continuously I called back. I was greeted by a girl who clearly didn't want to be there. I had to double check to see if I had called the wrong number. After I asked her if I could place an order she told me we never place orders over the phone in a curt tone. I told her I'd spent hundreds of dollars over the last 5 years placing orders with this store over the phone. She hung up on me. I called back and she said she didn't know what happened. Then she told me she had to call the manager to find out how to have me pay with my credit card over the phone and hung up on me again. Needless to say my relationship with this store is over. There are many brands out there to buy creams and soaps from. What kept me coming back to that location was the customer service. I'm sure they won't care if they lose another customer because they clearly don't have any interest in working. Very sad to see the old staff gone! I went in to get a hand cream as a gift. I received some of the best customer service I\u2019ve gotten in years from Ann. She is so kind, packaged and gift wrapped my purchase with so much care and made sure it was perfect. Ann is the best \u263a\ufe0f In life sometimes you discover things when not looking, and my path to L\u2019Occitane was a classic example of just such an encounter.\n\nOn a recent visit to the Prudential Mall, I sauntered into the store on a whim, not anticipating to buy anything.  That mindset changed fairly quickly when I experienced the amazing fragrances and the variety of applications that were on hand.  But that transformation was no accident, because Alisa who was minding the store, very adroitly guided me through the various products and offerings.  Her knowledge and zeal was a great motivating factor and I ended up with the delightfully fragrant Almond oil and Japanese Cherry Blossom soap and cream.  Alisa deserves credit in how she gives attention to customers and certainly in my case was a big factor in getting me on board as a satisfied and repeat customer.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice gift or something to pamper yourself, this store deserves a visit, and you may just find that most alluring scent that is irresistible.\n\nUpdate:  I had the occasion to recently visit the L\u2019Occitane store at the Markville Mall in a Toronto suburb.  I was equally pleased with the presentation and the ambiance, but more importantly with yet another great customer service experience.  Yolanda Au was outstanding in helping me and other customers with the purchase, and her cheerful demeanor was a delight to be around.  Yet another successful visit with a brand that I just recently got acquainted with. Went in the store just to see if they still carry the product that was gifted to me in a gift set. Liz was so helpful and knew the products so well. I was so thankful I could get refills. Best customer service and great place to get a Christmas gift. I was treated really rudely at this store. The staff not only racially discriminated against the moment I walked in the store, she told me to leave because I \u201clooked underaged\u201d and that they do not sell to \u201cunderaged people\u201d. The dark skin female staff, with sort of fluffy black hair that was tied up, in question not only took her name tag off before walking towards me but also gave me a disgusted type of look at me. Keep in mind all the other staffs in the store had their name tags on. I have been to this store before and was treated with respect that a customer deserves but not this time. I was looking at the hand creams and was going to try one of them on, the sample cream had a sign on it that said \u201ctry on\u201d or \u201ctry me\u201d, and the staff in question walked over and rudely told me that \u201conly customers are allowed to try the sample hand creams.\u201d  The female staff profiled as a poor person and was adamant that I would not be purchasing anything because I was poor. I came to L\u2019occitane specifically for their face wash as I have used it and quite liked it. I had go through this horrendous interaction just to buy my face wash. When I bought the product, a different staff who seemed to be white also gave me this disgusted look at me and did not give me a receipt for my purchase, even when I asked for the receipt. After buying the face wash I wanted to look at a couple other products, the same dark skin female staff came up to me and rudely told me that they were closing and kicked me out of the store. I came into the store at around 4pm and was there for maybe 15minutes max, on google the store says that they close at 8pm. With this interaction today, I would like to advise all other customers of this establishment to go a different L\u2019occitane such as the one in Natick, until the store handles this situation. These remarks made by the female staff in question is inappropriate and should be handled asap, as this is harming the company\u2019s image. It would be stupid of the store to take this matter seriously as you are losing customers because of untrained staff, thank you. I went strictly for the observatory deck and it did not disappoint! Beautiful sunset views and an amazing inner area to view that was protected from the high winds at the time.\nStill ventures outside to get those shots I was dreaming of on the way down to the PC. (Prudential Center)\nParking was easy. Make sure to get your ticket validated! Much cheaper.\nLots of shopping to do if that's your bag. Otherwise head to the top floor! Whenever I visit this side of the town I always visit here for food clothing or grocery shopping or sometimes just go upstairs and see the great view of Boston.

This was the best shopping experience I had in a long time! The associate working was attentive and helpful. They also knew when to give space as well. I was blown away by the customer service. The world would be a better place if more people like Christopher! Very nice staff who were also very helpful.\nWill be happy to come again.\n\nUnfortunately, my child is soon too big for the clothes. I don\u2019t understand the couple of negative reviews on here. The customer service here is great. The people here are really nice and they always remember me. The selection is great and they always go well out of their way to help me. I have bought so many wonderful outfits and hats here for my little niece and nephew and they love them! Very stylish! The worst customer service you will experience, consistently. Anyone can have a bad day, any business can experience one of those days where nothing goes right, but this place is constantly like a flaming inferno of awfulness.\nOn two occasions over 3 months, their receipt printers didn\u2019t work. Prepare to ALWAYS take at least 20 minutes to check out - even if you\u2019re the only one in line.\nYou may or may not get a greeting when you walk in, and if you do, you will likely be misdirected to the wrong part of the store for your needs.\nThe clothes are cute but the experience just isn\u2019t worth it, save your blood pressure and shop elsewhere. Horrendous customer service under the management of Shelby. She rings up returns incorrectly, missing items and keeping the merchandise you've paid for without refunding you. I realized when I got home, and she wouldn't do a phone return, saying I had to come back into the store. I HAVE A CHILD. I can't just POP IN WHENEVER. I asked to speak to her district manager and she wouldn't provide her name. She wouldn't put me on the phone with a co-worker, saying she was on break. Before this incident, there was a time she wouldn't let me purchase an item over the phone and hold it for me behind the counter for two days. DON'T SUPPORT LOCATIONS THAT TREAT CUSTOMERS POORLY. If you love the clothes, like I do, simply buy it all online and RETURN IT IN STORE TO HER. Just watch her like a hawk when she does it and check your receipt. In-person businesses can't take their customers for granted nowadays. They have to compete with online orders. If they aren't going to have good customer service, then shop elsewhere or use them as online purchase RETURN HUBS and see how long they last. I have a really strong prescription and weirdly shaped face.  Shopping for glasses that work for my prescription and fit my head/face is very hard.\n\nI came in a few times and tried on frames. Finally stumbled upon the perfect frame. I worked primarily with Martin.\n\nAfter receiving my glasses, I came in several times for adjustments.   But every single time I am treated with kindness, smiles, and pleasant conversation.  I know I am not the easiest customer when it comes to glasses. But the team at Oliver peoples is so wonderful.\n\nAnd my glasses are beautiful. Now I want another pair. :). Thank you. The team is very professional and friendly. My wife and I felt really happy to get our glasses for the second year from Oliver Peoples. The gentleman who helped us was very accommodating and worked his best to make both of us satisfied. I definitely recommend it to anyone who strives for good glasses and excellent service. I was so impressed by the Prudential Boutique- the selection was amazing & the service outstanding- for my first purchase, it was an excellent experience!  I have already returned to purchase more and the same outstanding service with another professional sales rep!    Grateful!! I recently had an eye appointment and was prescribed glasses. I decided to come to Boston for a wider selection than what is offered in my home town. Walked into Oliver Peoples and was greeted by \u201cSayma\u201d(spelling?j. She was kind, efficient, so very helpful, knowledgeable and not once did I feel pressured to buy. She spent over an hour helping me with design and personal fashion. I bought a pair and will most likely be back when the time comes to get another pair. I highly recommend her and Oliver Peoples. I had an excellent experience with them. It wasn\u2019t a terrible experience but certainly not great either. The salesperson wasn\u2019t trying to help beyond answering questions with minimal effort. We left the store and walked 15 mins to soma in south end and spent our money there instead (service at soma is exceptional!) Made an appointment and when I arrived, the lights were pff and the door was closed. Since I know now this service is unreliable, I sadly wont come back. Glad I did not have an important event to get a facial for because that would have been upsetting. I came from the airport in an Uber in hopes to grab some makeup because I had to throw some things away  at TSA that were in my purse and I get to the store 40mins before closing time and the lights are off and door is locked. Googles says the store closes at 7pm. You don\u2019t need a receipt or a box to make returns to MAC according to the MAC website but the very tall, white, and always beautifully/colorfully made up manager here has lied to me about this on more than one occasion. The first time I believed it to be an honest mistake but when it happened repeatedly with this same person I realized this is just a nasty lying game they play to discourage unsuspecting guests from making an honest return of something that maybe seemed great in store but doesn\u2019t workout for their skin or outside in natural lighting. Horrible customer service, I am simply appalled at how rude and unprofessional the staff members are.\nI tried on the long wearing lipstick and was handed the cleansing oil to take off the lipstick - no cotton rounds, no water soaked tissue to remove the oil (the oil was supposed to be rinsed off with water). I will not be visiting this place again, Sephora is so much better. If you're reading this, you probably already know that MAC sells quality. I'm reviewing this location in particular because they were wonderful.\n\nI took my daughter there for her first foray into her own makeup. Ana and Chris took care of her. They were so kind and so helpful. They helped her find what would work for her, and they did it while boosting her confidence. There was no, \"you'll be beautiful if you wear this,\" that you get with some makeup sales. They told her she was beautiful. They told her that imperfections were normal and don't be embarrassed. She walked out feeling more confident.\n\nIt was such a positive experience for her. Highly recommended. @sam_edelman I just bought this shoes yesterday. I asked sales for a new one and they said there was only one pair. So I bought it. But when I got home I found that the shoes must have been wore before. There are some scratches. Today I went to the shop and tried to exchange it. The sales thought that I was the one who wore the shoes and treated me reaaaaaally bad!! I explained to them and I just bought it yesterday. There was no time for me to wore it and go out. How could they do this to me. I am the consumer who bought shoes with full price and I was the victim!!! I should be happy for buying new shoes instead of being \ud83d\ude21\u2019 It turned out I really regret for buying it. I exchanged it with another one now and they said it\u2019s final sale in a bad manner. They gave me dirty looks and I felt extremely angry about that. From now on, I won\u2019t buy any shoes in this brand. I was promoting this brand to my friend yesterday. I will tell the story to them as well.\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 I love Sam Edelman shoes but very disappointed by my recent experience there. These were purchased only two months ago at the start of the summer and they are completely falling apart. When I called to see if they would replace the shoes, the associate said they will not replace them as this is only a cosmetic issue. To be warned that these sandals do not hold up! Very disappointing. This is the first time in my life I am leaving a negative review anywhere. I bought leather shoes a few days ago for over $100, have not worn them even one full day, the leather has already deteriorated/peeled off. When I came to return to the store, the store manager arrogantly responded \u201cI don\u2019t know how you wore them, I did not have such issues with my shoes\u201d. Unprofessional client approach, unpleasant experience both with quality and service. This is my last purchase at Sam Edelman. This store is in my neighborhood and when I came in today expecting the usual friendly greetings and customer service I was surprised my mother and I were not greeted when we entered, considering there were only a few people in the store. However, a moment after we had walked in the employee had quickly greeted a \"Welcome in!\" to two white women who had entered the store. I was shopping for shoes for a wedding and I inquired about a price to which the same employee responded in an irate tone, when my mother questioned why the same shoes had two different prices she received no response. We left the store in complete disappointment at the treatment. I have always been treated with excellent customer service every-time and I am quite frustrated but not shocked that such a clear display of discrimination took place. Very disappointing experience!  The Packer Ankle Boots - is poorly made. It was scuffed on the heels THE SAME day I wore it. Though I honestly and genuinely went to this store for a resolution, they were not helpful at all. I asked to get some kind of resolution since the shoes costs 130$ and was wondering why this could happen in the first place, and both the representative and the store manager told me I do not have any other option but to keep it. It is poorly made for the price it costs. I have also reached out to the customer support service via email which they were no help at all! I DO NOT recommend this shoes! I have experienced the same nightmare with USTrust investment advisors and now with the Client Service Assurance department. I have brought to their attention specific examples of negligence , specifically not following trust instructions.  I have done extensive research and review of the accounts and I am certain USTRUST Private Wealth Management has taking advantage of my 93 year Old mother for over 17 years. At this point they are withholding important records and have promised to reconcile the accounts, however, they will not return phone calls or emails from myself or my mother. This has been going on for several months(going on 6 months since I have repeatedly requested information on behalf of my mother) they refuse to return my calls despite the fact they have had full authority from my mother, in writing, to speak with me. USTRUST CANNOT BE TRUSTED! These people are horrible. No, wait, worse than horrible. They have hundreds of thousands of dollars of mine and won't give it to me. It's been six months. Totally unbelievable! I'd rather shoot myself than do business with these people again! US \"Trust\" my butt. The hotel is modern. Staff is excellent. Views of the city are great. The location is great with access to a nearby mall and an on-site restaurant.\nMy tip is to be very aware of who is around you and of your things when occupying the lobby. My wife and I were sitting at a table in the middle when I noticed a group of young men(teenagers) sitting on couches behind her. Our cell phones were on the table, and I noticed one of the teens coming close and eying our table. I immediately placed my hands on our phones and looked at the teen, and he went back to his friends. It was obvious he was contemplating a cell phone snatch and run. A couple minutes later, they all got up and began to leave, and as they passed our table, one obviously looked at the basket on my wife's knee scooter to see if there was anything to snatch. It was quite obvious they were looking for the right mark to steal from. My advice. Stay vigilant and secure your electronics and bags, don't get to relaxed and comfortable in that lobby. It would have been better if the hotel had both security on the floor above for overwatch and one on the 1st floor lobby. After you figure out the elevators, it's great! There is a YardHouse located inside, a pool, several large ballroom. Rooms were clean, staff was respectful and accommodating. I had a wonderful time! Came here for a weekend getaway.  I was recently in the Copley area, but stayed at the Sheraton and had a pretty poor experience there, so this time I opted for this Marriott and it was an EXCELLENT choice!\n\nUpon arriving the first impression was how large and grand the place is\u2026 inside and out!  It\u2019s connected to the walkways that take you to the Prudential Center Mall and Copley Place.  Checking in was PERFECT!  The best check-in experience I\u2019ve had in a long time!  Sorry, I forgot his name, but he seems to be the guy in charge up there (had lots of lapel pins of police badges).  He hit all the points when providing us with our check-in, especially when advising about the property and what comes with our stay \u2013 it was very informative and helpful!  I stay at several Marriott properties monthly (4 in the past week) and really enjoyed this level of attention to detail and helpfulness during check-in!\n\nThe property is huge, offering lots of elevators in the elevator bank and I love how you call them, but using a pad on the wall to select your floor and it tells you which elevator to use \u2013 Very efficient!  Our room was nice and comfortable.  The bathroom and room were very clean and everything worked nicely.\n\nSome bonuses when staying here \u2013 There is a $30/day resort fee can be used towards $30 in food/drink at Yard House, so we stopped in daily for cocktails, which were credited to our room.  You will also get 2 tickets to The View Boston \u2013 a great experience in the mall and a great deal when it\u2019s free!\n\nHighly recommend staying here \u2013 I\u2019ll be back! I stayed here with family for one night and found the experience to be fantastic.  We were on the 34th floor in a king-bed room.  The room was very clean, the staff were friendly and the location was key.  The decor looked newer and the room was very comfortable.  We were able to check-in and out, tip the staff, and use our room key straight from our cell phones which was great considering how busy the hotel was when we arrived.   I would definitely book with this hotel again in the future. My recent three-night business conference stay at the Marriott was marred by several issues. I've booked my room through a third party and was given a room that had a different layout to my colleague's, even though we paid the same amount for the stay. The initial room assignment process felt unfair, as I was informed by the front office manager that I was given a room without a bathtub based on my check-in time and there was also a visible stain on one of the beds. While I was eventually moved to another room, this created unnecessary hassle for me. Obtaining room slippers was surprisingly difficult, with conflicting information from housekeeping and reception. Finally, a simple request for a sewing kit was completely missed for over an hour, requiring me to go to the front desk myself at around midnight. These inconsistencies in service were truly disappointing. I\u2019ve had my Tumi backpack for over 12 years, and brought it in for repair right before the New Year\u2014likely the shop\u2019s busiest time. Connie helped me with the process, and she was incredibly responsive and reliable in handling the packaging and shipping. Three weeks later, I received my repaired bag free of charge!!  I\u2019m thrilled to continue using this backpack! Connie Yeh is an angel!\n\nI bought an aluminum suitcase online from a department store and started packing my stuff without resetting my password first (my bad - it\u2019s dumb to put things in before testing out the locks). The next thing I knew I was all packed, my new password worked on the lock on the top but refused to work on the lock on the bottom! I spent the whole afternoon yesterday trying to crack my suitcase open and eventually, I decided to visit a Tumi store.\n\nI came to Connie earlier this morning. She was patient and skilled. She managed to open my suitcase within 30 minutes! It was a miracle!\n\nNow I am sitting at the airport typing out this review. Go to TUMI Copley Place and look for Connie - she is the best! I brought in my Tumi backpack because my dog chewed up the handle. I asked a sales associate if she has seen Tumi repair such damage before. The other associate to whom I was not speaking rudely interjected to inform me they have sent in handle repairs. I asked if she had seen Tumi actually make the repair. She was very rude and abrasive. What she really meant to say was that she didn\u2019t know. Very terrible attitude. No surprise the store was empty. Friendly service and knowledgeable staff. Unlike many of the other locations I've been to they had loaner bags available and sent my bag in for repairs at no charge. Nice big store. The associate (Pei) was very helpful. I needed to buy something a little bit before closing time, and so I gave the store a call. She asked what I was interested to buy and selected out the items for me, so I can quickly choose upon arriving. I had a problem with my order and she promptly followed up with instructions to send to the repair center. Very happy with the product and the professionalism of the staff. Beautiful clothing. Robert is super helpful. Love everything I get. Renato and his staff are all great. Always get treated right! \ud83e\udd18 Don't ask this guy with his overpriced sneakers and useless customer service to help you fix a broken zipper pull that notoriously breaks. Forget it! Asian guy associate just staring at you no greeting or acknowledge customer walking in\u2014rude. I had to initiate. Other man on his phone rude, but greeted me. Would not give them my time nor purchase any goods from here. Stuck up vibes. Best clothing lines. Comes with a price but its worth it. Quality of fabrics is outstanding, modern design with a classic rock twist. Love the styles and fit, Renado is great to work with. If you love cards, stickers and papeler\u00eda you\u2019ll Love this place! The staff was very friendly also! Very interesting store, but expensive. Came early on Monday morning. The opening employee made sure to quickly get the store open and was extremely nice and welcoming. Great jellycat selection! I bought a gift for someone (2 items) and asked them to wrap it. I chose a small box and a paper and the lady that was supposed to wrap it told me that it will take 20-30 minutes so I\u2019d better go somewhere else and she\u2019d call me back.\nSo I left thinking that she\u2019ll wrap my gift nicely. I came back, got the gift and returned back to my home country (I was in vacation in Boston).  Turns out the sales assistant kept 1 of the 2 items for herself. If she forgot to put it she could have called me back (she had my phone number).\nI paid 23$ for a small box and some paper only to lose half of the gift I wanted to give.\n\nNever coming back! An interesting store that you can find a variety different kind of paper. This review was written for People's United Bank, since then M&T has bought them out.. there are MAJOR differences now, experienced after a year plus and the  fee structures are much more like a BIGGER bank (a major downside) and M&T is a MUCH BIGGER BANK.. WE were going to switch to a smaller bank, however we had too many automated bill pays tied to our acct and lots of checks left over tht we paid for, which M&T still honors.. the people are different there now, but still very nice as to wat they can do within their major corporate infrastructure .. so that's a plus.. so for now.. I'm leaving the old review up, that was written for the predecessor, People's United.. (it used to be a 5 star review, FORMERLY..)-- [OLD REVIEW]:  I am ONLY reviewing the PRU branch (& giving the PRU branch 5 STARS) and NOT The telephone customer service dial-in center, as stated in other reviews, ( i think things gutta change there for customer retention).  My wife and I and our daughter (now almost 24 opened her account when she was just 16) have been banking here since they opened at  the PRU, many moons ago.. They have always treated me EXCELLENT and they KNOW my name, my wife's name AND our daughter personally. They have the feel of a credit union or a small town bank, which we agree with. I try NOT to do business with the BIG banks for this reason and stay with the smaller regional banks close to home. Year after year I have stayed a delighted customer with this branch and its crew, which does change personnel from time to time but now eher enear as rapidly as any of the BIG banks. I would never have gotten the attention to detail, the supreme individualized customer service experiences nor the contentment of having had issues resolved numeroud times over the years at a big brand bank, no way!.. ALSO, an added HUGE perk, i can go to ANY ATM, if that other ATM belonging to ANY other bank anywhere in the country charges a service fee, People's actually reimburses me that other bank's fee, so i never end up paying any ATM fees watsover, even when i havfta use other banks' ATM machines and get charged that fee initially! Worst bank I\u2019ve ever dealt with bought out Peoples United, which was the best bank I ever worked with.\n\nRoughly 1/3 of my deposits and charges have been declined and they often have no record of said transactions. Customer service is polite, but ultimately useless. After several months of this I will be happy to pay BOA or another big bank the fees they charge. This bank just bought People\u2019s United bank. For months I got emails hyping the takeover, but when the day came for the transition, I still had no ATM card, NO CHECKS OR deposit slips. An email to customer service got no response a week later. A phone call got a response that hold times would be more than 60 minutes.  Finally I set my account up online and transferred every penny to another bank. I\u2019m done. The absolute worst bank I have ever dealt with. They are now a part of M&T. They promised a $300 bonus. I went into the branch at the Prudential center. Spoke with Iris and the manager. They verified everything and helped me open the account. When I fulfilled all the requirements I sent a message to customer service confirming that I have fulfilled all the requirements. They said yes and confirmed I will receive the bonus after May 20th. When I did not see the bonus in the week after May 20th I wrote to them. This time they replied. Sorry you do not qualify and made up some arbitrary reason. This bank is an absolute scam. NEVER bank with such an unscrupulous financial institution. I was referred to Peoples United Bank, and have absolutely loved it. It has the personal feel of a credit union, with the convinces of a commercial bank. They have unbeatable rates, reimburse you for ATM fees, are extremely secure, and are open on Saturday and Sunday. Their friendly staff go out of their way to ensure that you are acknowledged and taken care of. I recommned meeting with Stephanie, a supervisor at the branch. She is kind, knowledgable, and efficient. All in all a great bank. Made an appointment and when I arrived, the lights were pff and the door was closed. Since I know now this service is unreliable, I sadly wont come back. Glad I did not have an important event to get a facial for because that would have been upsetting. I came from the airport in an Uber in hopes to grab some makeup because I had to throw some things away  at TSA that were in my purse and I get to the store 40mins before closing time and the lights are off and door is locked. Googles says the store closes at 7pm. You don\u2019t need a receipt or a box to make returns to MAC according to the MAC website but the very tall, white, and always beautifully/colorfully made up manager here has lied to me about this on more than one occasion. The first time I believed it to be an honest mistake but when it happened repeatedly with this same person I realized this is just a nasty lying game they play to discourage unsuspecting guests from making an honest return of something that maybe seemed great in store but doesn\u2019t workout for their skin or outside in natural lighting. Horrible customer service, I am simply appalled at how rude and unprofessional the staff members are.\nI tried on the long wearing lipstick and was handed the cleansing oil to take off the lipstick - no cotton rounds, no water soaked tissue to remove the oil (the oil was supposed to be rinsed off with water). I will not be visiting this place again, Sephora is so much better. If you're reading this, you probably already know that MAC sells quality. I'm reviewing this location in particular because they were wonderful.\n\nI took my daughter there for her first foray into her own makeup. Ana and Chris took care of her. They were so kind and so helpful. They helped her find what would work for her, and they did it while boosting her confidence. There was no, \"you'll be beautiful if you wear this,\" that you get with some makeup sales. They told her she was beautiful. They told her that imperfections were normal and don't be embarrassed. She walked out feeling more confident.\n\nIt was such a positive experience for her. Highly recommended. If you love cards, stickers and papeler\u00eda you\u2019ll Love this place! The staff was very friendly also! Very interesting store, but expensive. Came early on Monday morning. The opening employee made sure to quickly get the store open and was extremely nice and welcoming. Great jellycat selection! I bought a gift for someone (2 items) and asked them to wrap it. I chose a small box and a paper and the lady that was supposed to wrap it told me that it will take 20-30 minutes so I\u2019d better go somewhere else and she\u2019d call me back.\nSo I left thinking that she\u2019ll wrap my gift nicely. I came back, got the gift and returned back to my home country (I was in vacation in Boston).  Turns out the sales assistant kept 1 of the 2 items for herself. If she forgot to put it she could have called me back (she had my phone number).\nI paid 23$ for a small box and some paper only to lose half of the gift I wanted to give.\n\nNever coming back! An interesting store that you can find a variety different kind of paper. Was walking through and was tempted for the staff member with  samples.  We hesitated because quite often these free samples come with an expectation (and pressure) to buy something.  But that was not our experience.  Super helpful, and friendly staff.  Got to try a couple other chocolate items.  All of them were tremendous.  Unfortunately we were not in a position to buy anything, but I would not hesitate to buy next time.\n\nYou can also order and have products shipped from their oversees headquarters.  (nothing is made local or in the USA). Some of the yummiest chocolates I have had! You can buy them by sheets or by weight. The almond one and the orange dark chocolate one were really good. What a delightful experience!\n\nThe store offers an impressive variety of flavors, each more delicious than the last. \ud83e\udee0\ud83d\ude0b\n\nPrices are on the higher side, the quality of the chocolates makes it worth every penny. Highly recommend for any chocolate lover! \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 Chocolate is good but the lady that was helping me today seemed annoyed by me asking for samples. I had taken a brochure home from my last visit (that lady and purchase was a very different exchange) I had an idea of what I wanted to buy but I ended up not liking it and I was looking to purchase two flavors. I had asked for three samples and asked if a kind was in milk chocolate because I saw it advertised. It apparently was a holiday edition so it wasn't available. When I asked for a third sample she said there's a limited amount for samples. This really turned me off and I just bought the first one i'd tried and got out of there. If you sell very expensive chocolate samples shouldn't be an issue you literally have someone everyday standing outside the store with samples.....I won't be back. Loved the Hazelnut Chocolate Bar! Better than Lindt when fresh.\n\nThe concept is niche, the quality is exceptional. I will go again for the Hazelnut Milk Chocolate Bar.\n\nThey also have gift packages for any given occasions. It\u2019s neat to kate spade store in the mall. The staff was generous and willing to serve.\n\nThey also give chocolate bites as tasters. Eat some and pack some for yourself and loved ones. I attended the Materials Research Society (MRS) international conference, which focuses on materials science. This annual conference is held at this venue. The facility includes a spacious area for large corporate exhibition booths. All floors are accessible via escalators, and there are numerous conference rooms available for presentations. December 2024. Okay, I'm going to be perfectly honest- the layout of this place is confusing as all hell. My friends and I came for Anime Boston, and this also doubled as our first time in the state, so we honestly had no clue what to expect. We did not realize that the convention center was attached to a large mall, so when we were trying to figure out where tf to get badges on Day 0, we sort of panicked.\n\nOnce you learn the layout of the venue, it is very easy to navigate and convenient that the hotels + convention center + food court are all in one location. CVS and Eataly saved us that weekend.\n\nThe convention center itself, take away everything else, is still very massive. It's multiple stories high, and each level stretches out pretty far. This was a wild concept for us because none of us grew up in a compact city like this- so that was another thing to get used to. Some of the panel rooms felt small and capped off early, but I know that's not exactly the center's fault. The dealer's room was HUGE and very well laid out. The convention really utilized the space of the Hynes in an efficient way.\n\nThe only issue that I did experience had to do with the convention center being combined with a mall. Because it's open to the general public, there were a lot of people coming up to us and harassing my friend group (plus other people in costumes).  There was a group of teenagers that approached us and started filming us to try to provoke reactions. Another random woman turned around and took a video of my friend and I walking, without ever saying a word?? Lots of rude comments and stares as well, mostly from families.\n\nThere's obviously no way to regulate this like you can in a space that's just a convention venue, or a hotel. But, it is annoying when you're just trying to walk to a panel, or go grab a water and randos try to start something. Alas, it was still a great time. Fantastic experience ! So many vendors from comics to anime characters, celeb panels, gaming center, photo ops, which my\nMain reason for going was Holly Marie combs the one and only Piper Halliwell ! She is so sweet, just all-around wonderful person we would definitely go back \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0d\u2665\ufe0f\u271d\ufe0f Older facility for conferences. Feels small. Limited restrooms. Must exit through security for food services etc. Great convention center centrally located near colleges universities restaurants and hotels. Hosted the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference for years. Great venue with many ballrooms and event space. Every time I\u2019ve gone here I\u2019ve had an amazing experience. I recently saw \u201cCrumbs from the Table of Joy\u201d and \u201cArt.\u201d Both were amazing and the theater staff is so wonderful!! I seriously can\u2019t say enough good things about this place. Excited to see \u201cThe Great Reveal\u201d tomorrow! The show \"Noises Off\" was fantastic. A very intimate venue. The players did an Awesome job. Enjoyed very much. Staff helpful and friendly. Can't wait to go to another show. My favorite theater in the Boston area. Intimate, comfortable and several parking garages near by. The staff is always helpful and friendly. Every play I have attended has been 5 stars. Just saw ART today and it was quite amazing having only 3 actors in the play and it was so mesmerizing. We didn't do much in there so my opinion is not that huge but the plays were awesome and we loved it even though the actors ignored our compliments it was still awesome. \ud83d\ude0c I came to this place for an assignment for my Acting 1 class to see \"Trouble in Mind\" now i come here VERY OFTEN whenever i get the chance. The staff are very friendly, the stage and theater are WONDERFUL!! After seeing \"Trouble In Mind\" & \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" & \"Yellow Face\" and Now \"Noises Off\" i HIGHLY recommend coming here!! Wonderful performances and actors and actresses! The Capital Grille is a top-notch steakhouse offering an exquisite dining experience. The steaks are perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor, complemented by an excellent selection of fine wines. The staff provides outstanding service, ensuring every guest feels welcome and well-attended. For those seeking a quieter and more refined atmosphere, seating outside the main dining area delivers just that. While the prices are on the higher side, the quality and overall experience make it worth every penny. Ideal for special occasions or an indulgent meal, The Capital Grille promises a memorable visit. Highly recommended! The decoration and ambience is lovely. We had very comfortable booth seatings. However the food is mediocre given the price point. We were not impressed by any of these dishes. The tomahawk steak was ok, the scallops were overcooked.\n\nThe highlight of the night was the cocktails. I enjoyed their signature drink a lot.\n\nOne thing we felt annoyed is that they served our entrees when we were still working on the appetizers\u2026so there were lots of plates on the table, made us hurry to finish the appetizers.\nI\u2019ve been to lots of fine dining restaurants in Boston, none of the restaurants would done this. One of the best burgers you going to taste. Friendly service without being intrusive. Great atmosphere including a bar. Great selection of beers and liquor. Mainly a burger menu but with some great alternatives. Gorgeous restaurant in the back Bay Area with lovely decorations and great vibes. The service was amazing and very friendly. The appetisers were delicious. The lobster crab cakes are off the charts, a mix made in heaven!\nBeetroot salad was very refreshing and delicious\nNow for the main dishes, we opted for salmon and were undercooked, under the salmon crust the salmon meet was almost raw.\nFor the meat dish, it was well seasoned and flavourful.\nLobster Mac and cheese was AMAZING and a must try. So I came here for a celebratory lunch with my father. I don\u2019t usually start with the atmosphere but this is old school steak house hunting lodge vibes and it really knocks that out of the park. Deep brown wood everywhere, old beautiful pictures and statues. Lighting was atmospheric and cozy. Service was similarly pleasant and attentive.\n\nI ordered a cup of the French onion soup, and their seared tuna entree option. I also had the mint lemonade and a glass of iced tea.\n\nThe soup was classic and good. I\u2019ve had better, but it was definitely near the top of French onion soups I\u2019ve had. I thought a cup was the perfect amount.\n\nI don\u2019t really like steak, but looking over the menu beforehand the seared tuna caught my eye. For me it\u2019s the closest think I\u2019ll get to eating steak, and I gotta say I really liked it. I ordered it rare and as I expected it was seared on both sides but raw in the middle, as it should be! It was encrusted with sesame seeds and plated on a small bed of rice which was very nicely and surrounded by a small bit of oil and sauce that I was constantly dabbing my meat into before biting in. In fact, if I had one complaint it was that I could have used more of it.\n\nIt came with a large side of asparagus which, besides being too much for one person, was also the only thing I ate that I\u2019m fairly certain I could (and really have) replicate at home. Did not feel particularly special, though decent.\n\nActually that\u2019s not quite the truth. I ordered both the mint lemonade (outstanding! Would highly recommend) and a glass of iced tea (unsweetened and would NOT recommend). A chimpanzee with a jug and a packet of Lipton could make that iced tea.\n\nOverall the food was very good, and the atmosphere was outstanding. We sat in a booth right next to the kitchen which I greatly enjoyed as I love getting a peak in the inner workings of the kitchen.\n\nSo why four stars and not five? Because at the price point of this restaurant very good food is to be expected. It has better be quite good for the money. And while the food was good nothing was mind blowing and I can think of many many cheaper restaurants all throughout the greater boston area with cheaper and yummier food that HAS blown my mind. For a fancy steak house it\u2019s good! But it didn\u2019t make me reevaluate my relationship to food. I know that\u2019s a high bar, but that\u2019s what I expect when paying these prices. The service was good. The atmosphere is great. But the salad bar and hot food bar is a little lack comparing other location. The meats are a little dry. Hope it is improved soon. Server Daniel did great job! \ud83d\udc4f\n\nRecommend! This could\u2019ve easily been a five star experience, as the food was as good as you would expect from any Fogo de Ch\u00e3o restaurant, and the service was as attentive (as they possibly could be given the seating).\n\nThe only downside of this place is that it\u2019s really based on pure luck on where you are seated, and of course, the host\u2019s attitude towards you when you are not seated in a convenient area. He didn\u2019t even bother to address the concern \u201cthat\u2019s the only table I got for you\u201d with a deal with it type attitude. Then he proceeds to seat a party size equal to ours in another table that was already empty.\n\nThis is inconvenient, especially when you order the Indulgent Churrasco as the waiters tend to have a blindspot towards you and cannot come to you as frequently with the selection of meats and seemingly tend to forget about you in that corner.\n\nOther than that, food was great as always, just needed it them to pass by us more often and not take as long with our other orders. Our first time back since the pandemic and the experience was far below expectations. We've been to this restaurant before and in other cities and had enjoyed the flavors and variety of meats.\n\nWe returned on a relatively quiet weeknight. The salad bar and protein offerings were definitely fewer than before. The worst part was that most of the meats were not properly cooked, most were dried and the beef sirloin was so rare that I could not cut through it. The garlic pork was bone dry and I could not take more than one bite. The best thing was the chicken leg which had decent flavor and not dry. The mashed potato had a lot of butter flavor but was quite dense. Polenta fries were dry. The desserts were adequate and always large portion.\n\nThe overall experience was poor. On top of all that, there was a problem with their temperature control so the whole restaurant was cold. I am sad to see how far this restaurant has gone downhill. We loved everything! My friends and I went to celebrate the birthday of one of us, the food was good and they have an amazing service! Our server was Daniel, it was our first time there and he explained us everything, he gave us some recommendations for food and drinks, and everything he told us was so delicious. Good selection of items on buffet which are overall tasty but there are mostly fillers that you should not fill up on but to just help supplement the main entree which is all the different cuts of meat they\u2019ll bring to table side and carve for you. Fruits to end the meal was good - sweet blood oranges and pineapples.\n\nThe selection of meat was decent though some cuts weren\u2019t as good - chewy, dry, or just overall hard that I didn\u2019t even bother with once it was on my plate. I liked the ribs, sirloin, and chicken the best.\n\nA special we had was the grilled cheese with hot honey. This was delicious! Too bad they ran out after we had one serving. From the moment the lobster gnocchi arrived at the table the aroma was intoxicating. I can see why this dish is popular, the perfectly tender chunks of lobster added a subtle sweetness. The attentive staff made our dining experience feel even more special. If you\u2019re a seafood lover then this dish is a must try! Great restaurant to celebrate a special occasion. Food is really good, service is very professional, and the ambiance is nice. Reservations are required, and the kitchen does close at 10:30, which means the last guests are seated at 10pm. It is very pricey - without drinks, it was about $100 per person. If it fits your budget, it is worth a visit. Their chocolate lava cake was truly exceptional! Beautiful spacious restaurant with high ceilings.  There is also a large LED lit mural as the centerpiece. The space is also dimly lit and really give off an art gallery vibe.\n\nThe complimentary bread is rather tasty.  Crunchy crust and nice and soft in inside. The butter is a bit bland side, though. 3.5/5\n\nLobster bisque-\nCreamy and savory with a generous portion of lobster, which was nice and tender. Very good!  4.5/5\n\nOctopus\nLarge portion of thinly  sliced octopus.  It was slightly covercook but still a tasty dish. The squid ink on the lentils did not add any flavor, but looked nice. There was also a little spice  kick to the dish that that complained it.  4/5\n\nScallops\n5 giant diver scallops. Nice crust on outside sweet and tender on inside. Perfectly cooked.  Came with a delicious truffle jam sauce. The prosciutto was a bit of a distraction  texture was. It was  slightly over cooked . The crunchiness  just seemed off with such a tender dish. Also, it is on the small size, so get a big appetizer.  4/5\n\nLIMONE\nCreamy and smooth lemon curd  that's not to sweet and not too sour. Topped with campati foam that adds a nice bitterness and buckthorn that's adds a bit of sweetness.  A very tasty dish  5/5 High-quality restaurant with lots of seating available in Back Bay. Great option if you don't want to go to North End as various parking garages are available nearby.\nService and some dishes (complimentary bread, gelato) are very similar to Ostra (Sorellina's sister brand).\nAmbiance and atmosphere are perfect for date nights! Would come again next time for special occasions. Sorellina in Back Bay is a must-visit for anyone seeking an exceptional dining experience. The atmosphere is classy and inviting, making it the perfect backdrop for a memorable meal. The attention to detail from the wait staff is impressive; they ensure every need is met without being intrusive.\n\nThe food is where Sorellina truly shines. Each dish is flavor-packed and thoughtfully prepared, transporting diners to a happy place with every bite. I regret not asking more about the chef, as the culinary artistry deserves recognition. The warmth and comfort of the dishes reflect a deep understanding of flavors, making each course a delightful journey.\n\nWhether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply looking for a remarkable meal, Sorellina delivers on all fronts. Don\u2019t miss the chance to indulge in this culinary gem. Honestly, it was one of the best burgers I've ever had! There are several options to choose from, and the hype is definitely real.\nThe burger is packed with flavor and comes with a huge serving!\nI can\u2019t wait to go back and try more of their burgers. I also ordered the Cobb salad, and it was very delicious as well. \ud83c\udf54\ud83e\udd57 First night in Boston and ate here at around 9PM. Place was still busy but not packed. Had the garlic parm fries, strawberry shortcake shake, and burger bomb. The shake was delicious and best part of the meal. The hamburger was filling, but not as juicy as I would have liked, but I did order it medium well. Fries were just ok. I would give this place 4 1/2 stars and will come back. Really great time at the Boston Burger Company, as it\u2019s not my first time here. I\u2019ve been here before, and it\u2019s always a great experience. Food is delicious and very filling, didn\u2019t go crazy for lunch. But definitely will be back and highly recommend anyone who\u2019s in the area, if you want a really good gourmet burger definitely come on by this place and check it out. The friendly staff serves the best burgers.\n\nThe burgers are juicy and the seasoning is excellent. The side of fries was the best I\u2019ve ever had.\nIt\u2019s a taste you can\u2019t experience in Japan, so I\u2019d love to visit Boston again just to have this burger.\n\nThe staff was also very friendly and provided polite service!\n\nThis is my favorite restaurant in Boston Good:\n\n\u2022Their Oreo milkshake was outstanding.\n\n\u2022Their fries in general are extremely delicious.\n\n\u2022Customer service was top-notch.\n\nBad:\n\n\u2022The wife had a BLT Burger and it was very meh!\n\n\u2022I had a chicken sandwich that was bland and frankly speaking boring.\n\n\u2022We couldn't find on-street parking despite going on a quiet day and ended up paying for parking at a nearby parking garage.\n\nOverall:\n\nI wouldn't go to the BBC for food again. I would, however, stop by to get their milkshake to go if I'm ever in their neighborhood. I never have anything bad to say about this restaurant. Our favorites are herb crusted blackened salmon, Louisiana chicken with bow tie pasta and red velvet cheesecake. If you get lucky you will be served by students. They are smart and if you tell them how you like the salmon cooked the food always comes out exactly how you want it. The salmon we got this time is superb, the most delicious salmon I ever had. The sweet potato fries are really good too. We have a side order and we got a really big plate with 2 dipping sauces.  Of course I\u2019ll keep returning. 5 stars I\u2019ve tried The Cheesecake Factory before in both San Francisco and Hong Kong, and I always thought the food was pretty good. So, when I visited Boston, I was excited to give it another try.\n\nUnfortunately, it was really disappointing \u2014 the food just wasn\u2019t good at all!\n\nI ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo, and the pasta was overcooked and mushy \u2014 it broke apart the moment I picked it up. On top of that, the grated cheese didn\u2019t seem to have melted properly, leaving an unpleasant powdery texture.\n\nThe Sheila's Chicken and Avocado Salad was just average. I\u2019ve had it in Hong Kong before, and it was delicious. But this time in Boston, it was missing cilantro, which took away a lot of the flavor. Plus, the dressing was barely enough.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say the food was disappointing and not enjoyable at all. As every other cheesecake factory, this was good. Food as always tastes great. Cheesecake cake was delicious. Drinks was ok. The service was great. This cheesecake factory is really big and on great downtown location. Paid parking cross the street Who doesn\u2019t love The Cheescake Factory! The prices are great and the quantity is humungous and its too hard for two people to even have a single dish! Go as a 3 people and you can still try maybe 3 dishes and top off with a dessert!\n\nWe had the Nachos and damn they tasted amazing!\n\nHave to go back here! The cheesecake was awesome and they are must try. Food was good but not great for me. Service was slow for our table which is very unfortunate. For their cheesecake, it's worth it We had a dinner on New Year\u2019s Eve, as a large party, we ordered most of the popular pizzas, and pastas. The food was good but the portion was not in proportion to the price! It\u2019s pricy for such a portions. This was my first time eating at a California Pizza Kitchen. It was a great experience. Fast service and the pizza was really good! We asked to move tableau but we're then forgotten about for some time. Once we were remembered service was well and we enjoyed our meal. I had a cucumber mocktail and it was delicious. We enjoyed the food, ambiance and service.   Not an exceptional choice, but nothing disappointing.  Grilled Salmon was good.   Plenty of pizza and pasta choices.   Kids choices are also good and nominal price.   Lettuce wrap also worth trying, but felt salty to me. Had dinner here and was quite disappointed. The pasta was pretty good but the pizza was poorly made. The cheese and the cutting were not it. And my biggest problem here was the wait time. It took a long time for them to take our order and even give us the check. Our waiter, by the name of Jess, ignored us a couple of times when we tried getting her attention. Most likely will not be coming back here Our experience was made amazing by Evan\u2014he was seriously the best! So sweet, so personable, and he shared so much about the food. And of course, the food itself was incredible. We loved it! Pictured is the calamari and the chips and guac, but we also got steak and sushi and the tacos! So good! Upon entering, all we can say is Chef\u2019s kiss . The music was enticing, the ambience was beautiful, and the food was delicious. We had a fabulous meal and experience. Scotty our waitress was amazing!  She delivered class-A service. We definitely recommend this place.\ud83d\ude01 The food was fantastic\u2014the oysters were fresh, and the sushi was absolutely a must-try. We also had the steak, which was decent but a bit dry. Their cocktails were great, with the passion fruit one being my favorite. For dessert, I had the cheesecake, and it was delicious!\n\nThe food was fantastic\u2014the oysters were fresh, and the sushi was absolutely a must-try. We also had the steak, which was decent but a bit dry, and the lobster tail, which was okay. Their cocktails were great, with the passion fruit one being my favorite. For dessert, I had the cheesecake, and it was delicious!\n\nThe highlight of the night, though, was our waiter, Omar. He was incredibly friendly and professional, going above and beyond to make our evening special. He even noticed when we dropped a napkin and brought us a new one in less than a minute. Huge thanks to Omar for his outstanding service! A friend recommended this spot and I\u2019m so glad we went. The service is great, the staff is warm and attentive to every detail. We got the truffle fries and small clam chowder as starters. For entrees, I got the Baja tacos and my husband got the Birria tacos. For drinks, I got the mezcal mule and my husband got the mango ale which he loved! We got seated in the patio and it was beautiful. Highly recommend. Food: we got the calamari, Ahi tuna and burger with truffle fries. The calamari was delicious, the octopus was thickly, cut and breaded perfectly with the paprika mayo. The burger was rather simple, all burgers get cooked at medium well which I thought was a little bit tough but still enjoyable with the thin fries and Parmesan sprinkles. The tuna was really fresh however perhaps the lemon was a bit too zesty over the dish but overall a rather well balance meal.\n\nService: the service was fine in mannerism. I do think it could\u2019ve been a bit more attentive, it just felt like they did the bare minimum. Like we ran out of water for a while and by the time it needed to be filled, we were already done with lunch.\n\nAmbiance: it\u2019s vastly huge from the bar to indoor to enclose patio to outdoor seating. There\u2019s a lot of natural lighting, which brings a light, full ambience and plenty of crowd to feel you\u2019re welcomed. They also have TVs displaying the latest games which is very fitting to our Boston culture. All guest are dressed rather sophisticated and they address the guest with elegance.\n\nLocation accommodation: it\u2019s inside the Prudential center, which you can enter inside the mall. Took an order to-go, pretty straightforward although it felt like everything was an extra charge... I mean, c'mon, $0.25 for a pickle? That should just go with the $30 crab roll or lobster roll you just bought... honestly. Crab rolls are better. Clam chowder is excellent, nice and thick and creamy. Definitely a treat, but expensive for a day-to-day meal. Straightforward establishment.  Our first place to eat while in Boston.  Had the lobster flight and a cup of chowder.  Everything tasted really good.  Really enjoyed the chowder.  Checked 2 boxes with this meal. Addy and Justin are great, they're always helpful and their information about the menu us clear and precise.\nI wish more places had representatives like them, they're great at what they do.\n\nFood is exceptional for a chain. This is the kind of place that you want to visit: it's quality food, very clean and has a great vibe!. A fun way to enjoy lobster rolls - Luke's Lobster was recommended by many people on my trip to Boston so I wanted to stop by. I was curious to try the crab rolls, which I loved MORE than the lobster roll! Ordered the lobster & crab roll Luke's way (mayo, butter, lemon) and it was perfectly seasoned - not too heavy on the flavors. The buttered roll was sooo delicious and make sure to dip in the clam chowder.\n\nClam chowder is classic, with more potatoes than clams...but def order as part of the combo set.\n\nIt's a fast casual type restaurant - you order and pick your chips/drink, servers were friendly and restaurant is chill and open! Lots of solo diners hopping in for lunch, and I enjoyed the solo experience! This was a good lobster roll but not the most flavorful or best one I've ever had. The place was underwhelming, but that's okay. It's more of a lobster shack kind of a feel. I'd still recommend trying it out because I know everyone's tastes are different, and it was still a good sandwich. Honestly, it was one of the best burgers I've ever had!

I'd still recommend trying it out because I know everyone's tastes are different, and it was still a good sandwich. We drove over one hour to dine there because the last time was great . We ordered the meatballs as appetizers but fell flat on that one. Our server Nicole took it upon herself to notify the manager who was kind enough to offer options. But baby!!!!! The meal itself was \u201c banging, finger licking good, slap your mama\u201d. The chef made sure we had no complaints!! We enjoyed it so much that we planned our next trip there. We had filet mignon, lambs, mac and cheese, spinach, mashed potatoes.. even the bread made a statement My fiance and I had a spectacular wedding shower here on a perfect Saturday afternoon in July. The cocktail lounge makes the perfect venue for hosting an event. We worked with the events coordinator Amanda who was incredibly responsive and on top of every detail from start to finish. Amanda ensured the afternoon went flawless. All our guests were incredibly impressed by the service, the food and the drinks. The bartenders Ally and Victoria couldn't have been more attentive and engaging to everyone in the room. They went way above and beyond to ensure everyone was having a great time! It was everything that I could have ever envisioned for the absolute most perfect day! Thank you! Mike & Derek This restaurant impressed on multiple levels. The food was exceptional, with each dish offering a distinct and memorable experience.\n\nThe Shrimp Cocktail was a perfect starter - generous in size and boasting perfectly tender shrimp. The Seared Chilean Sea Bass was the clear highlight of the meal. The combination of perfectly cooked fish with flavorful fried rice and crab was inspired.\n\nThe Filet Mignon deserves a mention as well. While slightly on the salty side, it was undeniably delicious - a testament to the quality of the cut.\n\nBeyond the food, the service truly shined. The staff was exceptionally professional, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable dining experience. I wish I could give 5 Stars. The Restaurant was Very nice. The Hostess Rene was Amazing. My Server was Very great from start to finish. The Mocktails were  on point. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was To die for. I was very disappointed with my Steak I ordered it Medium and I stressed Medium and my steak still came out Medium Rare. My server proceeded to tell me they under cook the steak so it\u2019s not over cooked. I didn\u2019t understand that. Maybe if I decide to try it again they can get it right. It\u2019s definitely not hard to make a steak the right temperature without over cooked it. I was very disappointed.. Worst experience in my life at this Del Frisco's location. I am a frequent goer to their restaurants and as we were eating our appetizers, a big mouse ran across the dining room right by our table. We were disgusted at the fact that we ordered $70 steaks that were on the way and the place was infested with rodents. We notified the server and all he did was raise his arms, shrugged, and said \"yeah that happens every now and again\". He walked off and did not acknowledge it any further or show any consideration for the big mouse that we saw in the public view where everyone was eating. Here we were, $300 later with no sign of a manager nor any consideration for our experience.\n\nWe then called to follow up on our experience with a manager twice, and both times we were told they were in a meeting and would call us back. Never did- so we contacted corporate. They said they would reach out within 14 business days. Still waiting on that correspondence. Not looking too hopeful on that one either. It was not only the experience that was horrendous but the customer service was even worse for such a high-end restaurant with high expectations.\n\nI work in the restaurant industry as well and all the restaurants I worked at would comp the entire bill for a party that had an encounter with a mouse while dining (when we had a rodent problem). The scale of these restaurants are nowhere near the level of Del Frisco's either. Absolutely disgusting. I might just have to take it up with the Board of Health since they clearly aren't dealing with the problem at hand. Do not go here- they do not appreciate your business and do not care about your experience/ cleanliness of your food. Dining out with my son, who has severe autism and intellectual disabilities, is not always easy. But our visit to Rochambeau was nothing short of extraordinary\u2014thanks to the unmatched hospitality of Manager Tommy Farkas and Server Diego. From the moment we walked in, they made us feel genuinely welcomed, safe, and respected. Their kindness and understanding went above and beyond any expectations I could have imagined.\n\nTommy set the tone with grace and professionalism, ensuring every detail was taken care of with warmth and ease. Diego, our server, was patient, attentive, and incredibly intuitive in handling my son\u2019s needs\u2014offering subtle accommodations without ever making us feel singled out.\n\nAnd the food? Absolutely divine. The steak was cooked to perfection\u2014tender, flavorful, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The French onion soup was rich, deeply satisfying, and possibly the best I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nBut the real showstopper? The swan profiterole dessert. A beautifully crafted swan filled with ice cream, presented with hot chocolate poured tableside\u2014it\u2019s a theatrical, delicious moment that brought pure joy to my son\u2019s face. He lit up with delight, and it\u2019s a memory I\u2019ll hold close to my heart.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just a meal. It was an experience\u2014full of compassion, excellence, and joy. Rochambeau has not only won me over as a lifelong guest, but they\u2019ve shown what true hospitality means. Thank you, Tommy and Diego, for making magic happen. I was visiting a friend in Boston, and he\nrecommended this french style restaurant in Copley Square.  The place has a nice ambiance with two floors and several bars. We had dinner in the \"steak room,\" and both ordered the steak frites.  It's a daily special that includes \"endless \" fries.  The steak was decent, but the fries were better.  The bread came with sea salt butter, which was delicious.  We took advantage of the endless fries and our server,  Delarose,  was attentive to all our requests.  The location is great, and I would come back and try something different next time. My family had a wonderful dinner event at Rochambeau. Tommy and his team were extremely accommodating. The presentation and quality of the food was perfect! Everyone in our party really enjoyed. The restaurant is beautiful with a great atmosphere. I would not hesitate to have another event there. French onion soup was probably best I\u2019ve ever had.great deal if you utilize the \u201csteak room\u201d. Food was excellent. Steak was cooked perfectly. Fries fresh and hot. Salad and baguette were very good. Wanted to come here for a while and didn\u2019t disappoint Standard service\nGood food.\nDecent ambience\n\nThe French onion soup\nsmothered with  in cheese- in a good way. The beef stock had decent flavor, but tasted a little watered down.\n3.5/5\n\nCrispy Duck\nDuck was good. Nice and crispy skin but  slightly overcooked, but good flavor with the honey and cranberry puree. Wild rice ragout was good as  well.\n4/5\n\nSticky toffee bread pudding,\nThis was tasty. Moist sponge cake covered in caramelized  bananas and a side of walnut ice cream.\n4/5\n\nIf youre in the area worth checking out. I had the beet tartare salad for a starter it was fresh yet rich. The Shirley temple was deluxe yet elegant. The steak frites were sophisticated yet they were a little rubbery, so if I were you get them more cooked then you would like them. Overall this meal was very special for my family. Great place for food! Came for a random Sunday brunch not really expecting a ton for a hotel restaurant but definitely blown away by the quality and flavor! Everyone is also super friendly and it's just a good place for warm winter vibes They were very accommodating in giving us a table with no reservation on a Sunday brunch hour.  Super appreciative for that.\nThe steak frites was done to exactly as requested.  As was the brie burger and that salad chopped was probably the biggest portion were seen.\nService was on point so no real complaints.\n\nIf there was one thing I had to say... The burger sounded better on the menu than what it actually was.  The garnishes just didn't mesh well... Maybe it's just my palate. We did not know this restaurant was a part of Boston restaurant week. An appetizer, an entree and a dessert for $41!! We thought the portion size must be smaller for this event but the portion size was so generous! I ordered Native Oysters (5!!) for appetizers, Pan Roasted Salmon for my main and Lindt Chocolate Mousse for again $41\ud83e\udd2f\nFood was great. I highly recommend trying this restaurant during restaurant week! We just finished our Boston Duckboat Tour and were looking for a place to eat. We looked at the window menu and loved what we saw. My wife is a vegetarian and they have two amazing mushrooms dishes. Wild Mushroom Tart: 72 hour marinated mushrooms, feta, etc. that was very tasty and savory. I had the Chopped Salad with a great presentation and perfect texture. Entrees were Wild Mushroom Pappardelle (that I wished I had too) and the Spicy Bolognese was good and had nice flavor. We ended our meals sharing a slice of Carrot Cake. My wife had an adult beverage (Blueberry Lemonade) that had a nice blueberry overtone. We can highly suggest City Table if you are in the area. Side note, very nice restrooms with automatic doors plus very clean. My first experience at Eddie V\u2019s yesterday was amazing.It was a pleasure to dine in and receive top tier service. The moment my son and I walked in, until we left we were well taken care of. They accommodated last minute seat changes. The waiter was very hands on and available and to top it off the food was amazing.  I\u2019m a huge fan of calamari and it was on point. Followed by lobster tacos which were full of flavor and surprises. The lamb chops paired with the chimichurri had my mouth watering. To top it off the truffle Mac and cheese, paired with the lamp chops will forever have my tastebuds yearning for more. I was very pleased with my meal and the service. Speaking of top tier service, I was stuck in the parking lot because my credit card wouldn\u2019t allow me to pay. Turns out I left my debit card inside the restaurant. The manager whom was in the grey suit found which parking lot I was in and brung me my card. When I tell y\u2019all, I went home and almost cried tears of joy. This was by far the best restaurant I\u2019ve experienced. My son and I go out often, I will surely make this one of our goto spots. Eddie V's Prime Seafood is an upscale Seafood restaurant located in the heart of Back Bay.\n\nThis place has exceptional service, they made sure we understood what was being served at each time, explaining the dish as they came out. Food came out quite quickly, and they even accommodated for any allergies in our party.\n\nThe food was good. It isn't the best seafood you'll find, but the quality of the dish was still high tier. The soups were rich in flavor, wasn't overwhelming on seasonings but still had the thick and creamy texture expected for the soups. The food portions were a bit small for the price, but the quality was still good. The dessert came out and they torched it at the table, providing a great photo opportunity as well as making sure the dish was served fresh and tasted great right away. I went with my boyfriend for our anniversary and it was the best restaurant experience I\u2019ve had to date! The food was a 10/10 super delicious and rich!! The service was also amazing, we had Danny and he was so attentive and kind. They even decorated the table, sent over free champagne and dessert because it was our anniversary. I couldn\u2019t say enough good things about this place it\u2019s a must try!! I dined here with friends and it was the best experience! The staff was professional and the ambience was soothing and perfectly suited for the occasion. Food was tasty, well presented. I had the Chilean sea bass, Crab fried rice, and the grilled asparagus. A bit pricey I\u2019d add but I\u2019d go again \ud83d\ude05. If there\u2019s one thing I love, it\u2019s a dining experience that balances elegance with efficiency. Eddie V\u2019s on Belvedere Street delivered just that, and the credit belongs to one person: Kari. This woman is not just a server she\u2019s a culinary concierge, a hospitality magician, and quite frankly, a reason to book a reservation here ASAP.\n\nFrom the moment we sat down to the last indulgent bite of our Bananas Foster, Kari was in command. Attentive but never intrusive, warm yet professional, she anticipated needs before they even formed in my mind. If you\u2019re making a reservation on OpenTable, do yourself a favor and *request Kari*. She\u2019s the kind of talent restaurants should be fighting to keep so, dear manager, give this woman a raise and start training her for leadership.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk food.\n\nWe started with the lobster tacos, which were exactly what you want in a seafood starter light, flavorful, and just indulgent enough to set the tone for the meal. My entr\u00e9e, the stuffed shrimp, was buttery, rich, and perfectly cooked, while my husband\u2019s crab cake and salmon held their own as well-executed seafood classics. The real showstoppers, however, were the sides the lobster mashed potatoes were pure velvet, the crab fried rice was a luxurious upgrade to a staple, and the Brussels sprouts brought the ideal crisp-char balance. And of course, no trip to Eddie V\u2019s is complete without their Banana Foster dessert it\u2019s an absolute must, every single time.\n\nI\u2019m a self-proclaimed regular(-ish) at the Burlington location, mainly due to parking woes at Belvedere, but this visit was a reminder that some experiences are worth the hassle. Even post-Restaurant Week (when service at some spots tends to wobble), the place was packed, yet Kari didn\u2019t miss a beat.\n\nWould I come back? In a heartbeat. Would I request Kari again? Without question. Would I suggest that Eddie V\u2019s recognize and reward her excellence? Absolutely. Consider this review my official nomination. I\u2019ve eaten here four or five times and each time has been outstanding. Services is very attentive, but not overwhelming.  Porto was quite lively, and the walls and surfaces quite sound reflective, which can make it a bit loud for conversation especially for older people during busy times. Amazing food, beautiful ambience and lovely staff!\n\nQuality of food is what really stands out and I would recommend to just try a lot of things and share all instead of going for one main dish each. Very cute place for couples but great for bigger groups as well.\n\nOysters - refreshing, fresh and delicious, a great starter for which manager Ned told us how to eat best.\n\nTuna tartare - I have never tried previously and absolutely loved it.\n\nFried calamari - great starter, I loved the sauce and the frying was done just right.\n\nLobster roll - a must have in Boston in general, but for this particular one the bread amazed me and lobster was of course prepared perfectly.\n\nCocktails were really good as well, the one in the picture is lavender based and wasn\u2019t on the menu but a recommendation by staff and I really liked it.\n\nWill definitely come back again! Great food and fair priced (for Boston prices, I guess). Came here with friends for NYE and service was amazing even though they had a full house.\nFood was delicious and I would really try the octopus and scallops, they are very good! I had an amazing experience at Porto. I started on the patio, but the hosts easily relocated my party when the weather turned a bit too chilly. The wait staff was attentive without being intrusive.\n\nStarted with the Burrata. I loved all of the vegetables that accompanied this dish. My main was the salmon. It was prepared perfectly with crispy skin. The BEST salmon I\u2019ve ever had. Finished with the tiramisu. So yummy.\n\nI highly recommend Porto. We had a very pleasant dinner here. Did a walk-in and was seated outside under the string lights and flowers, excellent vibes. Service was very good, wait staff had great recommendations. Food was stunning. The malfaldine pasta was to die for. I stayed for 4 nights at the Collonade Boston and this is their restaurant. I like their food but lacks variety. However, the staff are very accommodating. \u2665\ufe0f Good food selection and extensive drink list. Amazing service from Gaby. The maple bourbon wings were the best thing we had. We ordered quite a lot of things. My only down size was the fact that everything came all at once and as you try to finish one dish, the others get cold. Mind you it was only two of us.\n\n-Croque Madame\n-Cronut\n-Breakfast Pizza Flatbread\n-Chilli tater tots\n-Maple Bourbon Wings Lucie has an outstanding brunch and a great atmosphere to enjoy it with. Highly recommend coming here with friends.\n\nFood - 15/20 - Great Food. Eggs benedict is my personal favorite. LUCIE does it pretty well.\nService - 5/10 - attentive service with a good attitude. Par for the course\nAtmosphere - 7/10. The atmosphere is enhanced with art and an open restaurant concept style. Bar in the middle surrounded by tables and a patio on the outside.\n\nTotal - 27/40 - Good place to go for brunch If this review comes in handy please give it a thumbs up.\nWhile staying at the Colonnade Hotel. The LUCIE restaurant was open for breakfast. The host and waitress was quickly to serve us. We had the All American Breakfast. The perfectly prepared eggs complimented the seasoned potatoes with grilled onions. The meal came with a choice was sausage or bacon (I should have gotten the bacon) and wheat or white bread. The meal also includes your choice coffee or juice.\nA small cup of orange juice is 5USD and the whole meal is 19USD. Overall I enjoyed the food while spending quality time with a good friend. Food was fine but service was abysmal. We were there for 50 minutes before we got our food and service was nonexistent. I did notice other tables were getting better service so it may have just been our wait staff. However I asked the hostess for help and got no response, Highly recommend the Thai basil limeade and especially the the tamarind tangle. Dined in for late lunch with a coworker, and our great experience (both food and customer service) were well worth coming back here for a review. Though seating options weren't overly abundant, there was no wait to order on the kiosks and we received our food quickly on a dreary Thursday at 1pm. Came here for the first time with a friend and I have nothing but great things to say! I ordered the Namesake, The Korean Style, Kimchi & deviled egg as well as the Thai basil lemonade. Everything was amazing and the staff was super friendly. This is a pretty cool place to go to to get some amazing Bahn Mi! I would highly recommend Bon Me if you\u2019re looking for some good Vietnamese food! Banh Mi had uncooked smelly chicken and the texture of the bread was dry and sad. And they charged $12 for that. Not great if you're a hungry tired office worker and don't have any option but to nibble on the edible bits. Hopefully I won't get sick from it. The food is what it is. The price reflects the location more than the quality. However, what upsets me most is that 99% of the time I order my sandwich \"for here,\" they give it to me wrapped in sub paper, as if they didn\u2019t hear me. The expectation seems to be that I eat my food at the table without a barrier between the sandwich and the dirty surface. I either have to lay out napkins, as if I ordered from a sidewalk vendor, or ask for a tray or plate. When I do ask, they almost always look at me as if I have two heads. The inconsistency in whether the sandwich will be cut in half or turn into a mess is also staggering. Food was good (very over priced) BUT the guy yelling out the names needs to stop yelling.  Its very irritating and completely unnecessary. No one wants to hear some guy yelling peoples names to get their order. Erin was our lovely server.  Strong selection of brunch and lunch entrees on the weekends.  the restaurant will be closed for renovations starting February 1, 2024, but it should be back in April or May.  The huevos rancheros and eggs benedict are both fantastic.  My friend enjoyed her blueberry pancakes.  First class service.  Comfortable seating.   The restaurant gives a discount for patrons who are going to the Lyric Stage.  Type in a note when doing your reservations. Excellent place for weekend brunch!  Great, relaxing atmosphere, with wonderful, attentive,but not intrusive, and kind staff.\n\nSeated me very quickly, served some delicious coffee, and left a carafe on the table which was excellent!\n\nI had the Chicken and Waffles and it was exceptional.  Wonderful balance of sweet and a little spicy flavors, but not hot spice.  The cilanto and apple garnishes played shockingly well together.  One of the most unique takes on a classic southern dish I\u2019ve had.\n\nI would highly recommend, and definitely come back to again! Everything here was top tier. Had the Back Bay Benedict. Excellent. We had a large group and everything came out in a reasonable time. And they leave the coffee carafe at the table. Like that. Service and hospitality are A+, and this beet salad was hands-down one of my favorite food experiences in a long time.  I will come again!  A great spot for a business lunch. The food was spectacular with plenty of delicious gluten free options (not the pictured pasta) . I was blown away by the service, and will absolutely be going back. Gluten Free Crab Cake, need I say more We finally had a chance to visit and enjoy an early dinner. We started with bread and olive oil, then had the roasted chicken and butternut squash ravioli for our entrees.\n\nThe atmosphere was lovely\u2014bright and spacious, and we were seated quickly without a crowd. The staff was very attentive, making for a relaxing experience. While the bread and olive oil aren't complimentary, they were definitely worth it\u2014large pieces of sourdough paired with high-quality olive oil.\n\nBoth entrees were also exceptional, with generous portions and perfect seasoning. The presentation was impressive; the butternut squash ravioli was topped with bits of squash, basil, and fresh Parmesan, while the roasted chicken was incredibly tender, grilled to perfection with a delightful balsamic glaze and a charred flavor that complemented it beautifully.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to return and try more dishes! Exceptional experience! We are traveling for business and staying at Mandarin Oriental . We wanted to try Terra since it\u2019s just steps away from our hotel. I was a little concerned about the food when I was reading the reviews before we went to the restaurant , but I have to say I was definitely impressed with the food, flavor, service and ambience!\n\nEverything was exceptional. Grilled giant shrimp is a must try~~ just the right amount of charred flavor. Otto bread with butter is right on. The spaghetti pomodoro was so al dental with just the right amount of sauce. I loved the hot roasted oyster  . Now dessert \u2026. Tiramisu is out of this world. Probably the best I have had \u2026. Not overly sweet thank god! Service was excellent too, our server was very attentive , great attention to details!\n\nThis place is worth flying back to Boston, said my DH. the atmosphere here is so nice with the plants all around and the servers are very nice and friendly! my man and i got a few things to share, we loved the otto bread which  came with butter and lard, so good!! the grilled prawn was disappointing, expensive but not a lot of meat; we were honestly expecting 3 or 4 large shrimps. lamb was good, definitely smaller than expected. wagyu was our main which we split, very delicious! the carrots threw us a off a little and the potatoes were good but lacked salt. the highlight for me was definitely the tiramisu! it was delicious, fluffy and airy. i loved the cream used, i\u2019d get it again for sure! The experience at Terra was quite disappointing. The service was not very pleasant, which set the tone for the evening. Additionally, the dishes did not meet expectations; the food lacked flavor and felt very overrated compared to its price.\n\nAlthough the establishment had a promising ambiance, the lack of warmth in the service and the mediocre execution of the dishes make it hard to recommend for a satisfying culinary experience. Enjoyed the fish and skewers. The wood fired grills really shined there. The steaks and lamb were disappointing and a the wagyu was overcooked for a med rare. Service was great, not too pushy and pacing was perfect. While staying at the Sheraton I stopped in here for a late lunch.  Staff was decent.  The selection was nice as always.  Freshness was definitely there.  The BBQ chicken salad tasted pretty good too.  The restaurant was slightly unkept and heeded to be cleaned and have the trash emptied though.\n\nOverall, not bad. Stunning how far Sweetgreens has fallen. Used to be a reliable place to get a fresh salad. Last few times I\u2019ve eaten there, the portions are smaller and not fresh. Even the decor feels like a hospital cafeteria. The workers have negative vibes.\n\nMakes you wonder if they too have been the target of Private Equity, which is the case and a number of chains across the country. The business gets bought out and private equity strips out \u201cwaste\u201d or \u201cinefficiencies\u201d\u2026.\n\nToday, the lettuce in my salad was frozen and wilted. Will no longer be a customer. If you\u2019re looking for a salad in the Prudential, Eataly is your best choice. The food \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffe\nIt\u2019s so good and I always customize it and they never complain about my terrible and complicated mix of foods. I\u2019ve not had a bad meal here. Very disappointing lately. Went for Lunch to  get a Hummus crunch - person serving has no idea and only put half the stuff.  Then there is no bread and instead of saying sorry or let me see what I can do, the cashier goes it will cost you $$ for bread.\nSame thing happened two weeks back.\nThey are bringing people who have no idea what to do and spoiling the brand and good food.\n\nGood luck but I am not coming anymore. i ordered ahead for 6:05, it's 6:33 right now and i still don't have it even though i already received confirmation it was ready. Somehow, people who ordered way after me have gotten their orders. I've talked to the staff multiple times and they've been nothing but dismissive and inattentive. I was told i need to wait beschaust there is a line. Ridiculous. mid food not worth this. I absolutely love coming to Anna\u2019s Taqueria. Not only is the food consistently fresh and delicious, but the staff always treats me with such kindness and warmth. Every time I walk in, I feel genuinely welcomed and taken care of. It\u2019s rare to find a place that serves great food and also makes you feel at home. Thank you to the team at Anna\u2019s for always making my visits special. Highly recommend! READ AND SEE THESE PICTURES!!!!!\nI ordered on grubhub for my family of 4 after probably not ordering any fast food since June 2024. The driver is at the store shows a picture of a empty store after seeing what is taken so long to pick up the order. I call the store and ask what is going on with my order from grubhub. First claim is they gave the order to a driver who already entered and left the store. I contact support telling this and they say we'll the driver has the order, confused I text the driver again and ask If they have the food or not?  They show a picture of them in the car but don't answer clearly if they have it or not until after a few text of asking me to calm down on the magician act of no one knows where the food is thanks to the store. After saying they have it I thank them and tell them it's not your fault I do doordash and grubhub etc it's the stores fault for having no communication and hanging  up on customers for asking about their paid food. So the driver gets here and drops it off me and my wife and kids are relieved the food is finally here. BEHOLD JOKES ON US THE EMPLOYEES BURNED OUR MEAT, UNCOOKED BEANS,ROTTEN SPOTTED AVOCADO, THE BEST TRASH MEAL YOUVE SEEN YET. No hesitation I contact support again and let them know I want a full refund and this will be going straight into the trash it's not edible. No way you burn food and still make the order as if it is ok. They deserve to be fired for such a disgraceful act of cooking trash food.\n\nFood was order around 6:30pm arrived aboit 7:33pm from Anna's taqueria at 800 Boylston st from the Prudential. If this is what they do on the regular I want them fired and I have never wanted ppl to lose their jobs especially about food but this is well earned and I vow to never order from this Anna's again till the day I die Omggg! This was delish! We are in town visiting and we ate lunch here after The View. It was tasty, fresh and quick! I loved that they cut the meat right there in front of you! I\u2019ll def be on the look out for this restaurant in the future! It was fabulous Sucks that to food was actually not bad and the customer service was HORRIBLE . I got an attitude from each and every girl behind the counter down to my checkout . Not only that but I had accidentally left two things in the store (next to the register) and came back the next day to grab them .  One of the items were returned and Unfortunately one of the other was a gift card which some how did not make it back to me . YOU CANNOT FIND ONE ITEM AND NOT THE OTHER IF THEY WERE LEFT TOGETHER . They stole my gift card and robbed me of a nice experience trying new foods . Amazing flavorful food. Try the build your own burrito. Yummy & fresh. It\u2019s not greasy. And pretty cheap prizes for great portions ! Fairly decent banh mi styled sandwich. Was fairly priced at about 9 dollars for a 8 inch sub, and the quality of the food was fresh and tasty. Chips are overly expensive, avoid those (like 3 bucks for a single bag), but the overall meal was great. If you ask for water you'll get a tiny cup, so be sure to bring your own. Great little Cambodian kitchen in the Prudential center. They offer salads, soups, rice bowls, and sandwiches. They offer vegan options as well. The prices were on the higher end which is the reason for the 4 star review. We had the Five Spice Glazed Pork Belly rice bowl. It was packed with flavor and the perfect amount of spice. It was just not enough food for the $12 price tag. I will probobly come back again when I am feeling adventurous to try more of their large menu. I had the pork belly with quinoa it was good.  The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  Price is hmm..a little bit over but I guess it's because of the area. I go by this restaurant so many time since it has opened than I forget about this place. I finally tried and I was plenty surprised the five spice pork belly sandwich was well good cooked. The sandwich is similar to vietnamese sandwich, it has a thick slice of pork belly, shredded carrots, strips of cucumber, cilantro and sweet sauce on beget. I will definitely go back again. Good place for a quick bite if you\u2019re in the Prudential Center. Serving either Bahn Mi\u2019s or bowls, you can choose from meats like pulled pork and ginger brisket or veggie options like cauliflower. Prices range from $9-12 dollars for the sandwich, which has fresh veggies but perhaps overly done on the mayo-esque sauce. All-in-all, probably a better bet than places in the same price range at the Prudential Center, but I\u2019m not particularly dying to go back. Walking around the Prudential Center in Boston, one is always a few steps away from any number of eateries.  And most are for the visitor traffic that mostly abounds.  And in this milieu deciding to eat at a chain restaurant may not even be a weighing factor.  In that frame of mind, I decided to try the Wagamama, and found a pleasant delight.\n\nThe place has an open but a very communal seating arrangement.  Probably a smart way to manage a modicum of comfort, but also sustaining heavy traffic.  The staff all the way from the usher to the servers are very polite and run the place very smoothly.  I settled for a starter plate of Chili Calamari (fried squid) and pleasantly found it to be a taste above average.  The spicy cilantro dip was fresh and had that spike to meet the spicy aficionados expectations.  My main course was the Spicy Salmon Teriyaki with soba noodles, broccolini, and miso that made the morsels mouth watering.  The server Joshua brought a very bright attitude and added to the overall experience.\n\nIf you are looking for a reasonably priced, but a very good meal with quick service in a lively ambiance, this place will not disappoint.  Maybe you will share the same sense of satisfaction, with which I write this review. Started with Bang bang cauliflower. Presentation of the dish was very nice. It has a bit of spiciness to it but nothing outrageous. The appetizer has enough for 2-3 people to have a few pieces. Personally I\u2019d like to have it with a bit more sauce.\n\nI ordered the Udon noodles with Ginger chicken. The combination of tastes hit the spot! It\u2019s listed on the menu as a \u201clighter side\u201d option, this has nothing to do with the amount of food, it could easily feed 2 people. Defiantly is a must try if you\u2019re in the area. Don\u2019t get turned off because it\u2019s in a \u201cmall\u201d. Try it! The place is nice and lot is seating and one can find it tempting given the open kitchen and diners all around on tables. As a vegetarian it could be a bit struggle but then menu has straight few options which can be ordered and one can also request chef to understand one\u2019s diet and request to prepare accordingly. For eg: if one is not happy about tofu or mushrooms they can make dish without it. The soup bowl was great to have and can be added with some condiments to suit one\u2019s pallete. The best part was to have a big wooden spoon with which one can consume soup. Overall, well prepared food and taken care. Decent food and service, for a mall atmosphere setting. This is the second time that I've had food here and first time I've had it seated at the restaurant. When seated in the interior, the ambience makes it seem as though you're not in the middle of a bustling mall environment, which is nice.\n\nI had the firecracker chicken which was spicy as promised. We also had the dumplings which were fairly decent. Overall, not a bad place to check out when you are in the Prudential. Delicious food, nice space. Perfect for those who want good Asian-American food at affordable prices. We were very well assisted by our waitress Veronica, who was nice, quick and joyful. I recommend this place I recently visited this place for lunch with my friedn, and the experience was delightful. The food was exceptional (see photos), with creative and flavorful dishes that exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere was also charming, with a cozy and inviting ambiance that made it a pleasure to dine.\n\nHowever, the service was a bit slow, with a noticeable wait between courses.\n\nAdditionally, the selection of non-alcoholic beers was limited, which was a bit disappointing.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, I would still recommend this place for lunch. The food and atmosphere are well worth the visit, and the staff was friendly and attentive. With a bit more attention to service and beverage selection, this restaurant could easily become a top lunch destination. Gorgeous bar and restaurant. The best food we had in Boston by far. Every dish was incredible, generous portions, and perfectly seasoned. The staff were very attentive and nice. The atmosphere was excellent; relaxed and cosy. I was very welcomed by the host. Loved the ambiance and the darkness - went so well with the menu choices. The octopus was so great that I wanted to take it home. \ud83d\ude05 A little bit disappointed with the appetizer being salty, but it was a good combination with the entr\u00e9e and the bourbon cocktail. I loved how the general manager greeted everyone with such warmth and he held doors when I was done with my meal. Definitely coming again! It\u2019d be a waste if I didn\u2019t make use of the one time $30 Fairmont credit to dine below at the OAK Long Bar + Kitchen. I\u2019m all lobstered out during my vacation in Boston so I wanted to finish on a steak with an espresso martini. The steak was flavorful & tender, had enough fat, and the creamed spinach on top of the super crispy hash was a nice accompaniment. I asked for medium-rare and it came out a little more rare, which I don\u2019t really mind sometimes myself. But for a bone-in steak, if additional steps aren\u2019t taken, the meat near the bone becomes really hard to cut through. With the knife I was given, this was the case here. This would turn off some people completely but good thing I\u2019m a carnivore. Absolutely loved this bar! I stayed at the Fairmont for work and ended up visiting OAK Long Bar + Kitchen daily. It\u2019s the perfect spot for a date, chilling with colleagues, or even a business meeting.\n\nThe food and drinks were outstanding. Their Bee\u2019s Knees cocktail was gin-based but had an unexpected hint of smoky whiskey flavor\u2014so good that I ordered it multiple times. I also tried the Fiddlehead IPA, which had a nice citrusy note with just the right depth.\n\nFor dinner, I had a medium-rare burger wrapped in lettuce with Vermont sharp cheddar. It was cooked perfectly\u2014juicy, flavorful, and satisfying. The service was top-notch, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting, making every visit a great experience.\n\nWould easily give this place a 10/10. Highly recommended! My honest review of the parm: the Italian restaurant was solid but nothing special. I ordered a shrimp pasta and it was good but not great and same with the other pastas I ordered. They forgot a 12 dollar salad that was ordered and I never got the money back. The price was also too high relative to the serving size. Overall the food was mediocre but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend this over the other restaurants in the area.-ML They place itself is very pretty and looks nice to sit and eat. Overall, the food is absolutely trash. The baked ziti pasta taste like it was made a week ago and it is way too overpriced to not even taste good. This is not the place for a savory tasteful pasta. I got a hard block of pasta with a little tiny piece of chicken for an extra 10 dollars. The chicken has no good flavor only burnt char and taste like whatever was on the grille before it. The crust part on top of the pasta block was so hard i had to remove it because it wasn\u2019t even eatable. Smh! will never be spending my money here again. I recently visited Parm in Boston at their Copley location after a great experience at one of the NY locations. Given how much we enjoyed it in NY, we were excited to try it here too while in town for a few days.\n\nThe restaurant was surprisingly quiet, but it was a Monday night, so that may be expected. We ordered the pizza knots and chicken Parm, both of which were warm, flavorful, and delicious. The service was also excellent; both the hostess and our waitress were welcoming and attentive, making us feel right at home.\n\nHowever, the evening took a disappointing turn as we were leaving \u2013 my partner noticed a mouse in the restaurant. It was an unfortunate end to an otherwise pleasant experience and left us feeling uneasy about returning.\n\nI hope this was a rare occurrence because Parm has a lot to offer otherwise, but it definitely impacted our impression of the Boston location. Food was amazing. Try the appetizers and the portions are right sized so you don't end up rolling out.  Ask for Valentin. He is amazing and his accent makes dinner all that more romantic and wonderful. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this location to anyone.\n\nOverall the service lacked a lot. The staff were polite but very inattentive. We were seated immediately upon walking in but then waited over 10 minutes before our orders were taken even though the restaurant didn\u2019t seem very busy. And once we got the food, it  took another 40 minutes before the server came over again for the bill (I had to call her over).\n\nAgain, she was very polite. Just not very attentive.\n\nThe food was okay. The Italian fries were surprisingly good. The mozzarella sticks were ok.\n\nThe salad was disgusting, in my opinion. It\u2019s either an acquired taste or something in it was expired. I couldn\u2019t bring this up to the server because.. well she didn\u2019t come to our table to check in and it just got to the point where we wanted to leave.\n\nI do also want to mention a little confusion with the menu. The salad says 11/17, which I assumed the regular salad was $11 and if you added the protein, it increased to $17. I got the salad, as you can see, with no protein, and was charged $17. Just a little confusing.\n\nThe restaurant itself looked very nice inside. Seemed pretty clean from where I was sitting. I liked the atmosphere. Just the typical Dunkin Donuts\u2026 they offer mediocre service and all the tasty donuts and treats you desire with your coffee.  Their coffee is excellent, but their breakfast sandwiches are substandard.  It\u2019s very close to the Sheraton Boston, as that hotel is connected to the Prudential Center (a mall) on the second floor.\n\nCame here twice recently and both visits were just \u201cok\u201d but far from great. Order a drink with less ice and they fill half the cup with ice.. they don't fill the coffee to the top either. This has happened a few times. While I was standing there another lady complained they didn't fill her iced latte with whipped cream! I'm not surprised they are very stingy here. They mess up my order every day. Every time I get a sandwich its cold. Cashier can't understand a simple order. The ones in the hood are way better. Horrible establishment!!!! Wanted to get munchkins through app offer and they ran out before 1 PM. Tried to offer me a donut which is ridiculous. I\u2019m not paying for an overpriced donut. Then the manager stated he will give me an extra dollar for the trouble which was a lie. Neither Dunkins in Boylston near Prudential is worth the trouble. I swear if I enter inside I would make my coffee faster than them , Always mess up my order Just the typical Dunkin Donuts\u2026 they offer mediocre service and all the tasty donuts and treats you desire with your coffee.

I like their food but lacks variety. However, the staff are very accommodating. \u2665\ufe0f Good food selection and extensive drink list. Amazing service from Gaby. The maple bourbon wings were the best thing we had. We ordered quite a lot of things. My only down size was the fact that everything came all at once and as you try to finish one dish, the others get cold. Mind you it was only two of us.\n\n-Croque Madame\n-Cronut\n-Breakfast Pizza Flatbread\n-Chilli tater tots\n-Maple Bourbon Wings Lucie has an outstanding brunch and a great atmosphere to enjoy it with. Highly recommend coming here with friends.\n\nFood - 15/20 - Great Food. Eggs benedict is my personal favorite. LUCIE does it pretty well.\nService - 5/10 - attentive service with a good attitude. Par for the course\nAtmosphere - 7/10. The atmosphere is enhanced with art and an open restaurant concept style. Bar in the middle surrounded by tables and a patio on the outside.\n\nTotal - 27/40 - Good place to go for brunch If this review comes in handy please give it a thumbs up.\nWhile staying at the Colonnade Hotel. The LUCIE restaurant was open for breakfast. The host and waitress was quickly to serve us. We had the All American Breakfast. The perfectly prepared eggs complimented the seasoned potatoes with grilled onions. The meal came with a choice was sausage or bacon (I should have gotten the bacon) and wheat or white bread. The meal also includes your choice coffee or juice.\nA small cup of orange juice is 5USD and the whole meal is 19USD. Overall I enjoyed the food while spending quality time with a good friend. Food was fine but service was abysmal. We were there for 50 minutes before we got our food and service was nonexistent. I did notice other tables were getting better service so it may have just been our wait staff. However I asked the hostess for help and got no response, Me and a few girlfriends went for restaurant week. We met at the bar first, had the octopus and fries, which were amazing. Octopus cooked perfectly. Tender, not rubbery. The fries were crispy outside, fluffy inside and came with two dips. I know one was ketchup, but it was better tasting than regular! Had a couple drinks. The bartender is excellent. Very friendly and checked in on us a few times. My friend's husband sat at the bar for his dinner and said the bartender was incredible too! Tall guy with dark hair and deep voice, for the record.\n\nAny way, we went upstairs for dinner. The shrimp ceviche was excellent, very fresh and bright. The steak was fantastic. The onion rings on the plate, I didn't quite understand them, but it's onion rings. Who hates onion rings? The bread pudding was great. Everyone else at the table got something different and they all seemed to not like it. The cook on everything was great but the complements didn't work. The scallops came with a chestnut mash and pomegranate seeds. All cooked well, but not quite right. At least, that's the feedback I was told. The staff was a bit slow, so the refills of wine never happened.\n\nI would recommend this place to a friend, but maybe sit at the bar. Tip the bartender well. We spent the weekend in Boston and came here for lunch on a Saturday.  They were moderately busy and still serving their brunch menu at noon.  Check in was great, the hostess and manager were both very engaging and provided a warm welcome.  The fire place we sat next to provided nice warmth to help take the chill off from walking there.  The menu was filled with great items that looked very appetizing, as did their wine list.  They even have some very nice half bottles, which is what we opted for.\n\nUltimately, at the manager\u2019s suggestion, I opted for their warm lobster roll, but first up was their clam chowder.  My wife absolutely loved the clam chowder, so did I!  But we disagree about which was best between here and Abe & Louie\u2019s, as I felt this one was amazing, but I felt that Abe & Louie\u2019s edged this one out \u2013 She disagreed!  Either way, you can\u2019t go wrong with the clam chowder here, so get it!!  The next course was their incredibly large and fresh shrimp cocktail, which came with their zesty cocktail sauce and tasty homemade hot sauce \u2013 This was truly a great experience!\n\nThe lobster roll was made we meaty, fresh, sweet lobster and the brioche bun was made in-house and was outstanding!  In fact, the whole sandwich was amazing!  Save room for dessert!  We opted for ice cream with their home made hot fudge and that fudge was incredible!\n\nWe definitely enjoyed this visit and would highly recommend stopping in\u2026 we\u2019ll definitely be back! We had a wonderful dining experience. From the moment we walked in, the cozy and relaxing interior with a beautiful fire pit in the center instantly set the tone for a pleasant evening. The atmosphere was quiet, welcoming, and perfect for unwinding. We were also thrilled to discover their happy hour option from 3 PM to 5 PM, which included oysters for $2 :)\n\nAs for the food, it was nothing short of spectacular. We ordered grilled tuna, branzini, and halibut, and each dish was as beautiful to look at as it was delicious to taste. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the presentation was top-notch.\n\nThe staff truly elevated the experience. From the management to the waiters, everyone was attentive, on time with our orders, and made us feel incredibly welcome throughout the evening.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a romantic date spot, a place to host a business dinner, or somewhere to celebrate a special occasion, I highly recommend this restaurant. You\u2019ll leave feeling satisfied in every way! Our first time and we had an outstanding experience. We went there for Dine out Boston and definitely will come back. The options were great and the food was delicious. Dine out Boston Menu was $55 per person, with plenty of nice options. I had the Lobster Arancini for first course, the scallops for main and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert, all amazing. Our party shared a bottle of wine 2022 Evolution, delicious light body red. We sat upstairs all the way in the corner with 90 degree view of the city throughout full glass - the view was spectacular.\nOur party had a great time and we didn\u2019t want to leave, we actually stayed extra time and no one asked us to leave, which was so nice of the staff ( we didn\u2019t realize the time as we really enjoyed ourselves).\nThank you for amazing hospitality and great overall experience. We went to the Banks to celebrate my birthday, a surprise dining experience from my husband. The food was fantastic, I highly recommend the truffle fries. We sat at the bar upstairs. Service was a bit below par, as we waited for drinks to be filled again while the bartender chatted with coworkers. Other than that it was a great dining experience and we\u2019d be willing to give it another shot. I just want to acknowledge the workers of 185 Dartmouth, who have brightened my day each morning with fun drawings to my Starbucks order. I have experienced nothing but top-knotch customer service at this location. We need more people like you all in this world! Just bought today my cappuccino, like every single day, I'm giving 1 star because the white skin barista with yellow hair was looking at me in bad looks face, and that's not professional, So i won't never buy from this sturbucks store again. I prefer Starbucks over Dunkin overall I know they don't make the sandwiches in house the sandwiches come from another business all they have to do is heat up the food we got the holiday coffees 2 egg and cheese w/ sausage on English muffin Not a great location in my opinion the staff cares more about fraternizing among themselves and off shift co-worker than actual doing their job. As I stood and waited for my drink I watched one of the employees make himself two different drinks just to try and another employee just standing in one place on her phone while her coworker the ones that were working worked around her.\n\nAlso I noticed a crowed began to form in the store yet there were many drinks on the counter which gave the impression they were only making or prioritizing mobile orders. Hello! I don\u2019t usually do this but today I ordered a drink as usual but something happened I didn\u2019t like. One of the employee assisted a homeless guy on the cashier and then was me\u2026 after he went to make my drink and other customers drinks.. without washing his hand after he had contact with money .. I don\u2019t see that sanitize or good proper food and beverage.. thank you! People really like the food. I guess I don't know how to eat the food. They had Salad and sandwich and other healthy eating options.\nLots of sitting spaces. They sit inside and outdoors. This location doesn\u2019t even deserve to be given stars\nI went there this morning, that was my first time. I did not know that they have special hours of service i tried to grab garden salad .\nI was surprised by one associate yelling at my\nFace : don\u2019t touch that food !!! It\u2019s not ready\n! That\u2019s totally unprofessional !!! Extremely rude !! One lady was watching us , She looks like the manager she didn\u2019t even dare to come to talk to me nicely and to say that that rack of food is made for lunch not for breakfast\nI would never recommend this  location to anyone Cafeteria-style with a good array of different options, reasonable prices and enough seating. Enjoyed my build-your-own noodle bowl although there weren't any life-changing ingredients available or anything. Just a quickie review... stopped in because I had LevelUp credit to try something for breakfast. Ordered the breakfast burrito, but was told by the chef, he had no black beans and salsa. Well ok, peppers, onion, tomato will be close enough to a salsa? He was pleasant, but no burrito wrapper. Took 2 tried and even so, not a good tight wrap, making it messier to eat. And at over $6 with tax, pretty pricey. Tasted good enough, and the gentleman at the station was accommodating. Eat literally anywhere else in copley/backbay.\n\nIs the food here terrible? No. It's just absurdly sub-par and over priced. You can literally go anywhere else in Copley and get much better food cheaper. If you're looking for prepackaged items (chips, drinks, yogurts, etc) go across the street to the CVS. The salad bar here is $10+ per pound. I work in the John Hancock tower, and i avoid this place at all cost.\n\nIf your shtick is eating cafeteria or hospital food, then this is your place.\n\nIt's not a good value, and adequate would be a compliment for what you get here. Such a great place for coffee!\n\nConveniently located in the Prudential Center, Blue Bottle Coffee is right there for you to enjoy. Much like any other coffee places, they offer coffee, expresso based drinks, and pastries.\n\nWe enjoyed our experience at Blue Bottle Coffee.  You will too! Finally open again. Blue Bottle is one of the best cups of coffee in Boston. This location is conveniently located within the Pru, meaning I can go there without having to brave the weather on cold windy days. The temporary closure of this location over the winter was a major bummer\u2026 but it\u2019s open again!\nOrder ahead on the app, otherwise the wait can be long. Great coffee! I liked my Winter Single Origin Pour Over so much, I even came back for it next day.\ud83d\ude04 Cool ambience. Mega friendly and helpful staff! Blue Bottle Coffee is a must-visit for any coffee lover! From the moment you step in, the atmosphere is inviting, modern, and perfect for grabbing a cup to go or relaxing inside. The quality of the coffee is outstanding, with rich, smooth flavors that really stand out. Whether I\u2019m enjoying a classic espresso or trying one of their seasonal offerings, every drink is expertly brewed and packed with flavor. I also appreciate the wide range of options, from pour-over to iced coffee. Highly recommended!! Coffee and pastries delicious! The staff are very friendly. This is my favourite spot in Boston but I wish they have more space as usually the cafe is busy and there is no area to sit. They are the sweetest people that make the best coffee.   I would come here every day if I lived closer!  Bravo! Excellent chocolate croissant crispy on the outside and chewy inside very tasty. The lattes were Excellent as well. The staff was super friendly and accomomodating. One of the best coffee places with real tasty coffee! I think they are a part of restaurant Eataly, thus they have very-very good Italian coffee. I\u2019ve seen a lot of packs of Lavazza coffee.\n\nThe place inside is not too big, but it is enough space to make a quick stop, to take an amazing cappuccino with as well an amazing croissant.\n\nSince they are in Prudential Center - on of the most busiest shopping centers in Boston - they are always busy and there is a line of customers. But usually it is just a couple of minutes for wait.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried their hot chocolate. I\u2019m in love of it. It\u2019s almost unsweetened. It\u2019s very difficult to find unsweetened hot chocolate in Boston.\n\nBut there is huge problem with parking - just street parking, what makes your visiting longer. Sometimes, for 15-20 minutes. I usually visit Lavazza when I\u2019m at Eataly, but I was short on time and couldn\u2019t locate the Lavazza here, so I stopped at Caffe Vergnano instead. Both the cashier and the barista were very kind and you could tell that the barista was putting a lot of care into each drink he prepared. My cappuccino was decent but I found that I don\u2019t prefer Caffe Vergnano espresso (the preparation itself was fine). I will strongly advise against eating any of the pastries here. I got the almond cream girella thing and it was absolutely disgusting and definitely made me sick. The servers and baristas are very kind and helpful. The coffee is really tasty. Highly recommended.\n\n5/5. Good quality coffee, great ambience, service and menu variety! What a great coffee. Expensive for a small cappuccino but the original blend taste nice Good coffee, average sweets. I tried a cake which had a strong egg smell. Also tried a piece of lemon poppyseed cake (although they named it something else) which was below average. I had better ones in supermarket bakery Perfect cappuccino and wonderful croissants Really good coffee and quick friendly service. Some of my fondest memories was as a high school student, working  at the YWCA while in high school.  I did about everything there, from manning the News stand, Chatterbox dish washer, and elevator operator.  Thanks YWCA for making those memories possible. I love this organization and I have volunteered for them a couple of times. It is a blessing to work with them and support their mission. Many years ago was involved in this organization it was a pleasant experience. One of the most impactful social justice organizations in Boston! Great views It\u2019s the best gym in Boston hands-down! Women-only gyms should exist everywhere. It is reasonably priced considering all the amenities and class options they offer. I\u2019ve been going here for three years now and it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever done for myself. Very inclusive and non-judgmental environment. Highly recommend! I reached out about a promotion I received about a week ago and have not heard back, which was a little disappointing. Social media is such a great tool for connecting with their community, so it would be wonderful to see more engagement and timely responses there. If managing messages is a lot for the managing team, maybe the front-of-house staff could support that effort to help create a more responsive and welcoming online presence.\nUpdate Apr 16 2025: No one has responded via social media or email. Really great gym but Back bay front desk staff is rude. Shocked by the poor customer service at this location when the staff at other locations are AMAZING. Please be kind! Healthworks is a good women\u2019s only gym, has the potential to be great. Just lacking strong AC and quality classes. The stepper machines are not in locations for taller females, can hit your head on the ceiling if not properly leaning over. Have been coming here on and off for 3 years. Currently doing construction downstairs, very loud and less space. Hopefully the construction will be done soon and AC will be added! Overall if ok classes and low AC do not bother you, I would recommend Healthworks! Honestly, this is the best gym ever!!! They have all the equipment you would want whether you are more into weightlifting with barbells or prefer cardio machines or group fitness classes. It's always so clean; I feel like it's spacious enough where you aren't waiting forever or even that long for a machine or equipment on a busy day. I started coming here because of the perk through work and coworkers of mine who were members who moved out of state said that one of the top 5 things they miss the most about Boston is this gym.... it's pretty great. Barry\u2019s Back Bay is no joke! The class was SO hard, but absolutely worth it. They really push you to the brink, more than any other HIIT class I\u2019ve taken. If you\u2019re looking for a challenge, this is the place to go. The instructor was fantastic\u2014super clear with instructions and really kept the energy high throughout the whole class. I walked out feeling completely spent, but also really accomplished. If you\u2019re serious about getting a great workout, Barry\u2019s is where it\u2019s at! Love. Incredible workout, it\u2019s fun, motivating, challenging, and dramatic. All the instructions 8 have taken class with have been phenomenal. The studio itself is very well run, the front desk staff are inviting and it is easy to get someone on the phone if you have questions. The shower + styling amenities are great. Im a huge fan and think it is well worth the price. Bonus is the smoothie bar that can have your smoothie ready as class ends! Good class with Kate! She was high-energy and fun, which kept the class engaging. Not as challenging as Barry\u2019s classes elsewhere (London & Milan), but still a good workout. The locker room space is cramped and poorly laid out. Kate's classes are masterful. Nothing short of perfection. Her instruction is clear, her internal sense of timing is impeccable, and she doesn't blast the music too loud. She also provides a psychological element, and challenging structure to the class, that stops you from plateauing. She is an amazing Barry's instructor! This is such a darn good mood booster. The organization is respectful, donates to great causes and you have really made me feel accepted there. Thank you all- I\u2019m never disappointed. I\u2019ve taken classes with Mike P, Paige, Candice and Dan at Back Bay. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny."

I am often looking for the \u201ccheapest\u201d option Yana helps support my buying needs and is not judgmental. It may seem small but it means the world to me and makes for a better more comfortable shopping experience.\nOne that I have not received from local competitors.

Passion for TikTok\n4. Desire for viral success\n5. Plea for help and understanding This store genuinely terrifies me. I live really close and would rather walk farther and pay more to avoid it. Cashiers are rude and snappy, I've had multiple employees YELL at me before I have time to turn on my hearing aids, the selection is sub-par, the door has been broken for several months now, the best experience I ever had here was with one older male cashier who talked me into giving my email for the rewards program, and even then it felt like I was being forced to, but at least he was cheery and polite. Tip for all employees everywhere, if someone can't hear you the first three times you ask them if they want a bag, they can't hear you period, just charge them for a bag, DONT yell at them like this Walgreens does. Every. Time. This was my first time ever getting  any type of Botox/filler done. So obviously I was nervous at my first initial appointment! But Michelle made me feel so comfortable. I was so happy that she explained everything to me in great detail exactly what to expect and answered every & any questions that.\nI Most Definitely recommend anyone who is interested in this place to absolutely ago, or call and schedule your consultation,appointment asap!\n\u2b50\ufe0fLASER MD, on NEWBURY ST, BOSTON MA!\u2b50\ufe0f So disappointing. I did a full body hair removal and all of it grew back. I would give it two stars because my legs are ok aside from the areas that were entirely missed, literal streaks. The hair grew back within a year of getting all the treatments done and no I didn\u2019t have children to trigger hormonal growth. I would go somewhere else, not worth the investment.\n\nI just remembered this, I was leaving an appointment one day and I was concerned with how red and bumpy my skin looked and a woman I didn\u2019t know who worked there told me \u201cthat\u2019s what your skin is supposed to look like after we\u2019re done.\u201d That explains why it didn\u2019t work. Updated review: STILL FIVE STARS!!! Delaney is the best! I\u2019ve referred many of my own clients to her for filler and botox, she\u2019s my favorite aesthetic nurse in Boston!  Michelle was very sweet. She took time to take care of all my questions. She made sure I was comfortable at all times through the procedure. She did a great job.Tell her a big thank you. Sabrina  Brewer My experience in the last two appointments have been excellent. Botox both times! And yesterday I had a filler for my lips that I was looking for, for hydration and a little volume! The result was spectacular! Chikemey did so good! She has experience and knows what she's doing!Great results and it wasn't traumatic or painful! 5 stars, very satisfied! She is a great Aesthetic Nurse Injector! Highly recommend it!! I had a fantastic experience with their service. The team was incredibly efficient and attentive, providing fast, high-quality assistance. They resolved my issue quickly and effectively\u2014it actually took me longer to visit the Apple Store than it did for them to fix my headphones. Highly recommend their outstanding customer care and professionalism! I had a fantastic experience at the Apple Store on Boylston Street. From the moment I walked in, I loved the store\u2019s sleek, modern design and bright, open layout. The staff was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable, whether assisting customers with product questions or providing expert support at the Genius Bar, they were always there for the customers.\n\nThe hands-on experience was a highlight for me. Every device was powered on and available for testing. The store was well-staffed, ensuring that I never had to wait long for assistance.\n\nOverall, this location provides a top-tier retail experience that truly reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. I highly recommend visiting if you\u2019re looking for a smooth, engaging, and professional shopping experience! Excellent and amazing experience at this apple store. Got tremendous help trading my MacBook for a newer one. Here is the picture of store person shutting the door in my face at 7:55 PM\nStore closes 8pm. I came running to make it to the store to quickly pick an iPad I need. But Alas, they won\u2019t.\n\nSad to have another bad experience at Boylston street Apple Store\nMany bad reviews here\nSeems like a deep work culture problem\nNot coming here again Dropped in Monday to buy 2 iPhones. Adam waited on us and he couldn't have been more helpful. He never rushed us, answered all questions and guided us through the process of setting up the new phones. I was greeted as soon \ud83d\udd1c as I walked in. I was curious about this market the last time I visited this street. I observed window seating and thought about getting a drink and warming up inside. I was impressed \ud83d\udc4d when I walked inside.\nFresh fruits\ud83c\udf53 and vegetables, meals to go, healthy food, \ud83e\uddc0 cheeses, basic groceries and a deli that serves hot and cold subs and sandwiches \ud83e\udd6a.\nThe dining area was busy!\nI am not a Bostonian but this is a great place for a movie \ud83c\udfa5 company to come to if they wanted a good representation of a neighborhood store or market. Came for the Tuna Salad sandwich, keep coming back for the Tuna Salad \ud83e\udd6a!\n\nOh, and the pickle! \ud83e\udd52 So joyous am I about the divine pickle that the chef knows me as \u201cpickle girl!\u201d\n\nJust everything about this place is awesome!  Love their selection of every item, including the Iggys bread.  Forget Whole Foods, this is my main grocery squeeze!\n\nDid I mention the pickle? Is this place expensive? Yes. You are in Beacon Hill!  It is to be expected.\nBut, they have a great wine selection. Great location as well. If you\u2019re out dining in Beacon Hill at one of the many restaurants and then realize you need a good bottle of wine or a little bit of produce or that last minute element for your meal at home the next day, this is a great quick stop.\n\nWhen we lived in the Back Bay, we did not do all of our regular \u201cgrocery\u201d shopping here, as it is too expensive to buy the staples here, so we would drive to some of the bigger grocers. But it is a wonderful stop for items you forgot or don\u2019t happen to have in the pantry. Also, great stop for some of the things you can\u2019t find in the larger stores. At one point no one had lingonberry jam, and Delucas did. Again, great wine selection as well! And good deli. Ordered a sandwich and ended up buying three different types of sparkling water because I simply couldn\u2019t decide from their vast selection. The sandwich was huge and delicious, can\u2019t remember the name of it but it had mozzarella pesto tomatoes and prosciutto on sourdough. So good. DeLuca's has been my go-to lunch spot for almost 3 years. Consistent sandwiches and very friendly staff was always a welcomed experience. I could pretty easily justify the $10 sandwich given the beacon hill location and great staff, but charging $15 is just nonsense and can not possibly be justified. Either your suppliers are doing you dirty and you should switch, or you are doing all of your customers dirty and you should be ashamed. The store didn\u2019t have the item I was looking for, probably because it was from a past season, but Will recommended a basketball shoe that suited me and provided helpful information until the end. He was a responsible and dedicated employee. Thanks, Will! The online experience and the store\u2019s social media pages are top-notch. Nike definitely knows how to connect with its audience, whether it\u2019s through their online store or by keeping their social media pages fresh and engaging. I love how their in-store experience is consistent with their online presence\u2014high energy, great selection, and friendly staff. Overall, Nike is a go-to brand for me, and I think their combination of online and in-store shopping works really well. I've been to a lot of Nike stores stateside and worldwide. This collection was just ok, there wasn't a huge selection pick from and nothing really stood out. Some selections was the same price as online and other selections had cheaper prices, so overpriced. But I did buy 2 pair of shoes and shorts. There was 2 reps on the second floor that was very helpful, 1 black guy and 1 black woman. They was busy but very professional. All the workers here are super kind & sweet! They know everything there is to know about Nike. I know exactly where I'll be going for all my future Nike purchases \u2764\ufe0f Pretty big and complete. Went there on Sunday. Street parking is free but hard to find any spot. We parked our car at a garage. It cost us $45 for a 6 hours park. My wife and I had an excellent shopping experience! From the manager to all the sales staff, they were patient, kind, and offered lots of help to my wife even as they were closing up! Jasmine is the best!\nI had a stylist appointment with Jasmine C. She was above expectations! She picked great items for me and helped to find the right size. She is kind, patient and professional. I love wearing the clothes she helped me with! Unpleasant purchase experience because they did not give extra discount for sale items even though they had the sign outside the door and I confirmed twice before purchase. The store member attitude was very unhelpful and inpatient. Why my friend got discount for sale item but not me? Came to read their low reviews to see if they experienced the same \u2026 and of course\u2026 everyone not greeted/acknowledged in the reviews was a person of color. Same as me. Literally saw white girls greeted and acknowledged all around me.\nAs a New Yorker, I\u2019m never shocked when I come across this treatment in other cities, it\u2019s just crazy that it\u2019s still happening.\nBe better Madewell. All colors and races like your brand , have money, and can afford your clothes. It\u2019s 2022. Absolutely fell in love with the clothes here, and this is a great location. The staff is super helpful, especially in the denim section. And I love their program that allows you to recycle old jeans for $30 off a pair of their own jeans. Their summer dresses are easy/breezy, and their fall/winter sweaters are some of the warmest and comfiest I own. I also got a pair of high top leather/velour sneakers that were worth every penny I paid. By far the most comfortable pair I currently own, though I had to break them in a bit first. Pricy,  but a great treat from time to time. It's all just really good quality. Best store in town, there were many great stuffs with discounted price. Don't forget to go to the clearance area since u will find unique products. I got face wash for only $2 and 3 in 1 soap for $4.5. Really worth it.\nThere were also food and beverages in the store to fuel ur body. The staffs were friendly and nice, there were also restrooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Is a big store. Have everything you need. The prices are decent and they have a lot of clearance! Some clothing are s\u00faper good for the brands and quality.\nVery clean and organized store.\nCashier was nice.\nI love tj max\nNo parking spaces on the street. For all those who love T.J. Maxx, Boston has a few locations. The Newbury location is three stories tall. The store suggests a varity of products to buy with attractive prices. But the most important thing for not locals like me - they have a public restroom on the site. And for that I am greately thankful for the store staff. Many good present for kids. Michael\u2019s store on Newbury Street never fails to delight and enchant! My daughter got a visit as a treat after the Harry Potter exhibition in Cambridge and loved it! I\u2019ve been shopping here now for thirty years! The store has undergone changes in merchandise and it\u2019s currently all Harry Potter (it started as The Crow, has also had soaps, candles, silver jewelry, gnomes, fairies, Alice in Wonderland, etc). I still have a great deal of the items I\u2019ve bought over the years- good quality and selected with love. If the owner isn\u2019t swamped with customers, please take a moment to chat with him! He\u2019s the best part of the experience- super friendly person who sells only what he himself loves. Thank you, Michael, for giving my daughter a ticket for The Hogwarts Express- she loved your store! I am so happy to know this shop is going strong.   I used to go there in 1999 and when I left Boston In 2008 I purchased a large amount of my favorite incense, of which I still have one bundle today.  It\u2019s priceless to me.\n\nI\u2019ve never found another one worthy to burn in my home.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to visit one of the neatest shops in Boston. If you\u2019re a Harry Potter fan this is a cute little store to stop in.\nThey have just about everything Harry Potter.\nThe store is a bit small, definitely can\u2019t have too many people in at once. This shop was adorable! I was so excited to purchase the new Harry Potter Movie quiz game! The owner was a delight to talk to.. very personable and sweet. Would recommend for all Harry Potter lovers! Don\u2019t be fooled by the name fairy shop, it really has nothing to do with fairy\u2019s but more Harry Potter! It\u2019s a small store with lots of Harry Potter toys/games/posters/ and anything related to Harry Potter so if you are a Harry Potter fan this is a must stop on Newburry street! All kinds of great clothes and the price is right. The store is organized and clean. Staff couldn\u2019t be better!! Cashiers and staff are so rude and dismissive, I went to get a shirt and they said it's not in store yet and to order it online. So I order it then I literally see the shirt right there. Now they won't refund me and I have to wait 2 weeks for my full cancellation refund. Good prices on comfortable clothing for all kinds of weather. Heat tech turtles necks are a must have for New England Winters.  Dec 2021, still the best down vests. His products are wonderful and their quality is excellent. I like the various materials and the many designs. All the products captivate you to own them. Cashier in the second floor is very rude! She could be more friendly like other:( I walked into Ministry of Supply feeling completely lost. I had never worn a suit before, had no clue about my size, and wasn\u2019t sure what style would even look good on me. Honestly, I was kind of panicking. But within minutes, Zariya put me at ease. She was incredibly professional, guiding me through the options and helping me find the perfect fit\u2014without any pressure or confusion. From the moment I stepped in to the moment I checked out, the whole process took just 30 minutes.\n\nZariya and Jan were both so friendly! I actually enjoyed the experience, instead of feeling stressed. They made me feel comfortable, like I wasn\u2019t just another customer but someone they genuinely wanted to help.\n\nAnd the clothes? Amazing. I wore my new outfit for a full day of walking around, and not once did I feel restricted or uncomfortable. The fabric moves with you, breathes well, and looks sharp. Plus, the store even offers a $25 tailoring credit, which is a great bonus.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who dreads shopping for work clothes, go to Ministry of Supply. They make it easy, and you\u2019ll walk out looking and feeling great. Love the stuff and ambiance.  Staffs are friendly. Clothes are amazing. So glad I had the chance to stop in and try them on before ordering online. I know my sizes better. Walked out with some great items. The Apollo shirts are the best you'll ever wear.   Staff here are so helpful and friendly!  Highly recommend this store and third products. Visited many different suit shops on Newbury st and this one was the best by far. The staff was actually kind and I felt like a belonged there. The atmosphere was calming, sleek and fun/exciting. Their product is top of the line and felt amazing and they really care about the customer and others. For those in need they even give big discounts or even free suits. I am a huge fan now have been there a few times and got my wedding suit there.\n\nThey gave some discounts for when I got my suit tailored and let me tell you, I could dance in this suit and I wasent uncomfortable it really is amazing tech They have in this material. No other brand came close. I also got some socks and underwear, great quality. Great customer service even when I got a stain on my shirt. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really think the company is on to something. The design language is excellent and pretty consistent fit between colors/ products. However, I visited the storefront for the first time and the customer service was awful. Upon entering it took far longer than anticipated for the employees behind the counter to look up from their devices. I did not feel very welcome, nor did they seem eager to help me find some clothes. That said, the store is small but it was clean and they do have a decent selection of the essentials, however they were out of colors and sizes I was interested in. I hope on my next visit the customer service is a little better, as someone new to the brand. Love this location! I never skip out on this UO because of the great selection of products. The staff is always so sweet and helpful. The store is organized logically and is typically clean. They carry a lot of the items on the website so it's never a waste of time to check out what they have. The sale section is a bit messy and sometimes they seem understaffed, but besides that love it! Terrible customer service at this UO on Newbury Street. The cashier gave me a barely readable receipt. When I asked for a reprint, she was rude and clearly annoyed. After I insisted, she intentionally printed more blurry copies and refused to take responsibility. No apology, no basic manners. Completely unacceptable. I hope corporate sees how unprofessional this staff is. Maybe ask your mom to try reading that receipt \u2014 if she can. Every other time I come here and to the Faneuil hall one it feels like I\u2019m being profiled. Which is funny because I literally use to work at urban back in the day LOL weird vibes for the protection of pretentious overpriced clothes. I had a little coupon I wanted to use but it\u2019s honestly not worth investing in sketchy and discriminatory retail so I\u2019m kicking urban to the curb finally Friendly service and a good atmosphere. Hip shopping experience on Newbury St! Taylor was super helpful and managed to find a few different sizes of things in the back for me. Would give 5 stars but the store was unbearably hot inside, not sure I\u2019d come back to this location. MUJI is a famous Japanese stationery, home goods, and clothing store with locations all across the globe, with this location being their main store in the Boston area.\n\nThe store is spacious, with a wide range of textbooks, papers, diffusers, and clothing options to choose from. The options are on the expensive side, but the quality is pretty good to choose from and there is a lot for a wide range of styles and preferences.\n\nThey also do sell some food here in pre-packaged form, but it didn't really catch my eye as something special. About a month ago, I saw a black linen jacket and pants set on their website\u2014something I\u2019d been trying to find for over a year as I have to wear black suits often for work. Since I live nearby and wasn\u2019t sure about sizing, I decided to buy it in-store. I first visited in March and was told the items would arrive in the next shipment. I returned after calling and confirming they were in stock, but when I got there, I was told the box hadn\u2019t been unpacked yet. I was understanding and gave it time.\n\nOver two weeks later, I called again. An associate confirmed they had the items in stock, so I made a third trip to the store. Once again, they weren\u2019t on the floor. The associate scanned them and confirmed four were in stock\u2014but said the stockroom was \u201ca mess\u201d and no one from the stock team was available to retrieve them.\n\nAt that point, I\u2019d made three visits and several calls and still hadn\u2019t even been able to try the items on. I emailed the store to explain what happened, hoping for a helpful response. Instead, I got a polite but generic reply:\n\n\u201c I am deeply sorry this happened to you.\n\nIt's not the experience we wish to create for any of our customers.\n\nThank you for brining it to our attention and allowing us to address it.\u201d\n\nBut nothing was addressed. No offer to help, no follow-up\u2014just a brush-off.\n\nIt\u2019s really not even that big of a deal, I\u2019m literally trying to give them my money; but they are making it impossible to purchase the items to a frustrating degree. Really cool store with a mix of high end school/office supplies such as pens, markers, notebooks and such. They also have a very nice selection of men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes. Gives a Zara type vibe. No logos, not much in the way of patterns. Simple yet quality clothing. Clean, minimal and functional everyday goods that fit into any home at a reasonable price point. Great stationary and pen selection as well. Just the essentials and nothing else! Love love love this cute Japanese store!! The stationery selection is amazing! \ud83d\ude0d\nThe clothing is a little pricey but good quality. The home and kitchen section and knick knacks are wonderful! A must visit in Boston!

Incredibly friendly, helpful, and patient staff and excellent pricing for Farrow & Ball paint.\n\nI was painting for the first time -- and with Farrow & Ball (not beginner friendly.  Sad face).  The poor Johnson Paint staff were on the receiving end of a slew of my dumb questions, all of which they answered patiently.  Can I use trim paint on the wall?  Sure and here are your options for gloss.  How do I open the can?  Here are free openers and stirrers specifically for the F&B cans.  Why does my wall look ugly?  You need another coat and we can have the extra paint ready in two hours.  Honestly the best.\n\nI also *think* that their F&B pricing is lower than orders placed directly through the F&B website.  Johnson Paint offers a small discount if you call in the order over the phone. This place has been here for close to 60 years....they're obviously doing something right. Johnson Paint is truly the best. Incredibly knowledgeable, friendly and helpful staff. I\u2019m consistently impressed with the customer service whenever we stop in or call. I won\u2019t buy paint in Boston from anywhere else! Amazingly knowledgeable staff, and very helpful Although I just moved into the MA area, I really do agree with the other reviews that this might be the best store. The people are REALLY nice and the prices are great - really gets you excited for the next project you have coming up. Visited True Value across and down the street and found Johnson Paint to be loads more friendly, helpful and affordable Johnathan was super friendly and greeted me when I entered. He asked if I needed any help and was helpful with all my questions. Also, he wasn't pushy at all, as I know some GNCs try to push certain products on you.\n\nThis was my first time coming to this location, and I'll be coming back as I had a great experience and a great customer experience too! Highly recommend BDY SQD!  I train as a pro athlete and every week use their facility for recovery.  They have significantly helped me reduce my tendency to develop overuse injuries and their treatments have greatly enhanced my recovery.  All the employees are genuine, polite, helpful and very friendly.  The owner is on location daily, very personable and extremely passionate to provide the best services in Boston. Incredibly friendly and knowledgeable group of fitness performance and recovery professionals! Helping you reach peak performance in your active lifestyle. Studio is clean, booking is easy, and the no fluff sessions are a perfect 30 minutes. Feel the difference after your first visit! I've been coming to Bdy Sqd for about 1 year now and I can tell the difference it's making in my form. Coming from a person with years of back problems, you cannot go wrong with this place and will walk out of your first stretch feeling great. In addition the staff is super friendly and really make you feel comfortable during your visit. Keep up the great work guys! Ive been coming here once a week for at least 8-9 months now and i couldn\u2019t say better things about it. My body is constantly aching from a variety of workouts combatted with sitting all day at work. A weekly visit to BdySqd keeps me feeling good so i don\u2019t need to worry about aches and pains while i teach!! The staff genuinely cares about your wellbeing as an athlete and regular human and they\u2019ll go above and beyond to give you the tools and relief you need to chase down your goals. 10/10 would recommend! BDY SQD has helped me in so many ways. I always look forward to my weekly appointment (especially after a long day at the office) and find that every time I leave I can't wait to come back. I count on BDY SQD to be there for me when my body needs it most and they never disappoint! I highly recommend this studio :) During our recent trip to Boston, I stopped into the Arc'teryx store for some help with my Beta AR coat. It ripped during a snowboarding trip this season and I was hoping they could help me with repairing or warrantying. I loved the coat and used it year-round for all my outdoor adventures... I was greeted when entering and was directed to speak with Zac about my issue. He inspected the coat and then went to work. After a few moments, he was able to warranty my Beta and replace the coat! I left that evening with a replacement coat, a huge smile on my face, and a great experience. Arc'teryx has a customer for life. I cannot say enough great things about the people at this Boston store. Everyone was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I'd leave 100 stars if I could! Thank you Zac and team for all your help with my dilemma! I purchased a jacket from Arc\u2019teryx less than three months ago, and it started ripping on the inside. When I went to the store for assistance, the first associate (who seemed to be a manager) was dismissive and just told me to start a claim online without really helping. Since the issue wasn\u2019t visible online, I explained that I needed in-person support, but she kept pushing me off.\n\nThankfully, AJ stepped in and completely turned my experience around. He was incredibly helpful, asked all the right questions, and took the time to start a new claim for me, even adding detailed notes. He went above and beyond to make sure everything was taken care of. Later, he even called me personally to confirm that my jacket was under warranty and that they would swap it for me.\n\nAJ provided outstanding customer service, and because of him, I\u2019ll continue to shop with Arc\u2019teryx. If you ever need help, I highly recommend speaking with him! I picked up an online order (Sentinel Jacket) from the store, only to discover the security tag was still attached when we were about to head to the ski area. This was incredibly inconvenient and frustrating, especially given the timing. A simple quality check at the store could have avoided this hassle. AJ and the other store owner (woman w glasses) were nothing but unhelpful. A simple trade took more than 45 minutes. The other retail representatives had no clue what they were doing. I actively saw both store managers walk away from helping the other retailers with my trade in. Its helped me made the decision to trade in all of my arc\u2019teryx after this. This ain\u2019t it. Do better. I submitted an order and did not realize, it will arrive after me and the wife had already left for a long vacation, and dont want to pkg at my door step during our absence, called Arc'teryx and they modified my delivery from  slowest to quickest and will get to us a few days before leaving, so that jacket will me very warm and cozy where we are going....Attagirl Lilian, Newbury Boston store.... A pretty good selection of all kinds of music! Some K-pop albums were a bit overpriced (especially Twice), but others were good. They also had a decent amount of albums on clearance.\n\nThey had a huge selection of blind boxes (keychains, figurines) as well. These were also priced pretty well and are similar to what I\u2019ve seen other places. An overall nice place to shop for music and little trinkets. My daughter and I traveled to Boston in early December to celebrate her birthday. We hit Newbury Comics on Newbury street to check out some shirts and vinyl. I was happy to find some punk to add to my collection, and my daughter found some metal for hers. We selected a few shirts, and I got a gift for my sister (a kitschy oven mitt with images of cat butts on it).\n\nWe didn't look at our haul until we got back to NC, and I realized the clerk who checked us out missed a security tag on a shirt I bought for my son. Going back to the store wasn't an option, and I called around locally, but couldn't find anyone willing to remove a tag from another retailer.\n\nI reached out to Newbury Comics via email and explained the situation. I got a response quickly offering to send me a replacement. I was shocked because I was expecting a big hassle involving sending the one with the sensor back and waiting for the replacement, but nope. No hassle at all. They put the replacement in the mail at no cost to me, and I received it yesterday. My son is stoked and loves his new shirt.\n\nI really appreciate great customer service and the fact that these folks made things right. Their shirts aren't inexpensive, but the price is definitely worth the service. I'll definitely visit again the next time I'm in Boston! Wonderful Store . If you \u2764\ufe0f Vinyl new or old they have a ton. Great posters and Knick knacks also. Super cool shop with a lot of collectors stuff. I\u2019m a big fan of Funko pops and their collection was great. They have new and recent funkos. They also have a second floor with comics and manga and other collectibles It\u2019s a really nice place with hundreds of records and nerd stuff I live in the UK. I have a Patagonia Nano Puff jacket, purchased in the UK. It had a small loose thread on the arm. I was in Boston with work and popped into the store. They fixed the loose thread on the spot, without the slightest hesitation - took it downstairs and I had it back 15 minutes later. Didn't ask me for a receipt or anything like that. They stand by their products - I was really impressed. Makes good business sense too - I will buy more of their products and tell people about the good service I received, as I'm doing here. I wish more businesses were like this. My thanks to the person who helped me. I live in Connecticut and our Patagonia location recently closed. While visiting Boston I decided to walk in and ask about some wear and tear on my decade old nano puff jacket. Knowing I\u2019d be without a jacket on a cold night if I sent it in for repairs, the team kindly offered to swap it out for me and send me on my way in a brand new jacket. They confirmed my old jacket would be donated. I\u2019m so glad I invested in a Patagonia jacket and I\u2019m grateful for the amazing staff at this location. Some of the staff are a bit stuck up and not as friendly to customers who are not of a certain demographic\u2026. This has been my experience after coming to the store 4 times. Do better. Let me start by saying I love Patagonia! However, this weekend, when I was in the store, my request for help was constantly walked over by the stroe associate as they continued to help others who had asked for help after me! I had been asking for a particular size for the mens galcier jacket. As they made me wait and stand there as they literally handed the last piece in the store to a couple who asked AFTER I had requested this. This made me feel like I was an afterthought, watching them give the last item that I had patiently waited for to someone else.\n\nUnfortunately, this was an in sale item that was unavailable online. Sigh, what a bad experience for such a great brand. Literally the most helpful staff. I always forget they are on Newbury Street and I recommend stopping in if you need some repaired before shipping it off. Unfortunately the pharmacists weren\u2019t much of a help. The lady didn\u2019t move from her position despite having really bad stomach cramps she told me to goto the doctor as noting is available without a prescription When i asked for assistance, the lady behind the counter was extremely impatient and edgy. No help was offered. I have left with no medicine and very uncomfortable experience. Saturday 25th at 2.40pm. Great Pharmacist, very professional, considerate and understanding of urgency. There is a drugstore on the first floor and a pharmacy in the basement :). They have everything you need. From shower gel to vitamin C ;). The experimental space has been wonderful hosting my classes there. The store is well kept unlike its sister store nearby. But the service here is not on par with other stores. Too many women discussing their life choices with each other whilst they literally ignore you to finish their conversations with each other. Educator Laura was texting instead of saying hello or answer any questions. On top of ignoring everyone walking in she proceeded to run over to another employee to gossip during which time the manager on duty did nothing to redirect her attention towards helping guests Among all the Lululemon stores I\u2019ve visited, this has to be the worst. The customer service is well below expectations, and they\u2019re out of stock on many items. At this point, I\u2019d recommend just shopping through their online store. This is one of their experiential stores, I was blown away! Right upstairs you have access to studios, a lounge, full locker rooms and a cafe. Incredible! My wife received a gift for Christmas from one of our daughters which arrived on 12/15/24. She opened it on the 25th but didn\u2019t like the dresses. Tried to return them on 1/4/25 but the return line was ridiculous. We left thinking to come back at another time maybe it was after Christmas returns that made it look out of control. Went back to the same Zara Boston store and sttod in the exact same chaos for 1 hour and was told we were past the 30 day return policy and basically to screw. I showed the employee the pic of the chaos from 1/4 and that both my wife and I had been really sick with the flu and hadn\u2019t had a chance to get back there to return it. Called their customer service line and was told nothing could be done. These return lines are def meant to be stupid long so peeps leave rather than waiting to return the items. Zara sucks and will never shop there again for any reason. BTW todays line was a 50 minute wait I bought a pair of shoes from Zara online and  the quality is truly terrible, and you can see the excess glue along the sole. It\u2019s also the most painful pair of shoes I\u2019ve ever walked in, the material is SOOOO hard that it\u2019s not even possible to break into. I didn\u2019t have high expectations but this experience sealed the nail in the coffin for me to never shop here again. The African-American girl who just \u201chelped\u201d me with the return on the second floor was extremely rude, just walked away while I was still talking to her trying to do another return and then gave me attitude. I hope the manager takes notice. (If she\u2019s the manager - your store is doomed) I was here at 5:30 pm 12/21\nI understand it's EOY and store is busy for holiday season. But that doesn't mean you can be rude to a customer with no reason.\nSecond floor desk staff was very rude, rolling her eyes just because she couldn't identify my order. I asked if there\u2019s anything wrong and she totally ignored me not even looking at my eyes. Again, it\u2019s holiday season and packed but I really hope there was some basic/professional manners. I was patiently waiting in the line as well - meaning I was as frustrated as the staffs. You can\u2019t just laugh, roll eyes and dismiss the person in front of you Store can be messy, tables full of clothes piled up and they do have long check out lines but I have to say there ARE DEALS in this store. I found a $90 jacket for $19.99 on clearance. So check the store out and have patience. Check out girl was very friendly. I don't typically post reviews for chain stores, but the staff at this location were extremely welcoming and helpful. I walked in on a rainy evening and ended up ordering 2 pairs online there so I wouldn't have to carry them home, but I was not pressured at all in person. The sales person measured my feet to double check size (my current boots in my usual size feel a little big), brought out the styles I was interested in to try on, and then suggested/offered to place anything on hold or for me to think about it and come back or order later, if i wanted. Their attentiveness + zero pressure to buy in that moment was much appreciated. River, who works at this location is amazing! She really helped me and I ended up buying 3 pairs of boots and shoes. When I came to this store I was despite last fall after having a nightmare foot surgery. I was at my wits end. I could not find any shoes to fit me and had tried on more then 60 shoes of various brands.\n\nHowever, once River saw my problem she said she new just what I needed. She is amazing. She ended up fitting me in Doc\u2019s that had a deeper wider toe box and it was just what I needed. I am grateful she took the time to help me. Her knowledge and customer service skills were top notch! I had the most fantastic customer service experience at Dr. Martens thanks to Mea! She was incredibly knowledgeable about the products and helped me find the perfect pair of boots. Mea was patient, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase. Her enthusiasm for the brand was contagious, and I left the store feeling like a valued customer. If you're looking for exceptional service, ask for Mea at Dr. Martens\u2014you won't be disappointed! The staff are super super nice and accommodating! But I believe the information they give on the shoes are not accurate to what the official website says and how the shoes are. Love my dr martens (I have multiple) and the pair that I got at this location I was told to size up saying it would \u201cshrink\u201d and mold to my feet. I did and two years later they are now so big that the extra room gives me blisters when I use them. My other docs that I have bought else where are true to size and have truly molded to my feet. I went today to this location for another pair and was told to size up again for it to \u201cshrink\u201d and mold to my feet. And that if I get a pair that\u2019s snug it wouldn\u2019t stretch because this brand of shoes don\u2019t stretch. When I mentioned how my boots that I bought in the past that were sized up are now way too big and uncomfortable, I was told it\u2019s because I wore socks that are too big and it stretched out too much. Needless to say today I chose to buy shoes that were true to size. When I checked on the official website they say to purchase \u201ctrue to size\u201d docs and not to \u201csize up\u201d. These shoes are too expensive to get the size wrong and be stuck with large shoes due to strict return policy. Pretty groovy store. Every pair of Doc Martens you could possibly think of is sold here, even the sandals. They also sell socks, insoles and products to keep your new boots looking shiny. Friendly and helpful staff. Full selection of Timberland stuff.\n\nI went for the classic work boots because I love that boot, but the pair I had never fit right.\n\nThey helped me size the new pair just right, and i couldn\u2019t be happier! Great ambience; folks show enjoyment working there. My choice, \"Men's Sushi\" weren't in stock there - So what?!? They teamed up to find in-state, and Internet sources, got my measurements, gave me a sweet discount, *and*, having been in sales, did something I appreciated: did a sweet job of making sure I come back to that store. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc96 I bought a pair of shoes  at this location. I must say that the employees except a young fellow seem careless about the people that go in. Really disappointing.\nThe employees lack knowledge of what is in stock.\nI would suggest the employees get some training on providing top notch service.\nThis is my second time purchasing there and will be my last.\n. Completely horrible experience here. First time going boot shopping and the store employees were super unprofessional and rude. Their employee Marc grunted every time I asked him about a shoe and constantly made sarcastic comments. He then lashed out on me telling me that he already explained me something (he did not). Then he rips away the shoes I was trying on and throws it back in the box and goes to the back of the store. He legit did not come back again and when I complained to the manager Stephanie on the treatment, she replies \u201cMarc isn\u2019t like that\u201d. These employees don\u2019t know how to treat customers at all. They should be expecting a call from corporate. Normally I ordered online and picked it up at this location. Now the friendly staff recognizes me when I walk through the door for the pickups. Good customer service and friendly atmosphere. Good job to the management and staff. I love everything I\u2019ve gotten from Ted Baker as a brand but the sales people at this store are by far the best I\u2019ve ever dealt with. My girlfriend and I came into the store and even though we\u2019re in our early 20\u2019s we were immediately greeted and Rhi was extremely nice and helpful to us, even though we were just casually looking. Most higher end stores just ignore us which can be frustrating when we\u2019re actually looking to buy but we never felt like that in this store, we had a warm welcome and never felt out of place. I ended up getting a shirt and some shoes that I\u2019m extremely happy with and I probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten if Rhi wouldn\u2019t have talked to us and helped work on some different outfits they would go with.\nWe had the order shipped to us (not from the area) and in the packaging was a hand written note which is a very nice touch and not something I was expecting at all from a store like that. I can\u2019t wait until we move to Boston so I can get more things from this store. I really couldn\u2019t be happier with my experience! My husband and I have been customers of Ted Baker for years. My mom recently bought my husband a shirt for the holidays, but because of Covid we only recently exchanged presents. The shirt didn\u2019t fit, and they wouldn\u2019t take it back (even though the tags were on it and we had a receipt). A store policy that doesn\u2019t take extenuating circumstances into account (especially when there\u2019s a receipt, tags attached and the garment is clearly unworn) needs to be called out. The value of the shirt is one thing, but the waste of time is another - especially when you're only trying to exchange something to make your in-law feel appreciated. Perhaps Ted Baker should learn to value and respect their customers. We\u2019ve spent thousands here over the years, but will no longer shop here again.\nImpt to add: the salesperson was respectful and we have/had no issue with him whatsoever. He was clearly executing company policy. I had the best customer service experience here. I had a scarf that broke. Becky from the store personally went to another store to find the scarf and hand delivered it to my house. Just amazing incredible customer service!  Thank you Becky!  5 stars!!! High quality clothes at a premium price.  On Boston's fashionable Newbury street, so you can people watch as you come and go. Great selection of stylish, high end men's clothing My girlfriend looked for a graduation dress here and had a great experience with the staff. Unfortunately, none of the styles were particularly flattering for her body type. This store is in general a hit or miss for her, a lot of the dresses which cinch in the waist are poofier and make her seem larger than she is. If you're boxier or have a more boyish frame a lot of the styles here are super pretty and will look great on you!\n\nI'd skip the candles and kitchy books, you can find them cheaper online or at other stores.\n\nThe jewelery is nice but a little expensive Huge dress selection. Staff vey helpful. Very big sale section. The manger was very helpful and brought a dress out that they had just got in which was exactly what I was looking for. She steamed it for me too. Above and beyond. Great place to shop for young girls. I always find something there for my 21 year old daaughter Personally never enjoyed the service from the staff at this location,  I offically only shop online and event then that's a bust Great Prices! Cute clothes, jewelry, and knick knacks. The girls that work at this store are nicest, sweetest souls on the planet! I came in 10 mins before close looking for a bridal shower gift and they were all so helpful and friendly. They helped me find the perfect gift for my friend and didn\u2019t even mind that I had shopped after store hours. I\u2019ve never had a better shopping experience in any other Anthropologie. They are the best at this location!!!! Came here on a sunday, with my sisters , who was greeted by a girl in the front of the store with a smile , and immediately dropped when she saw me, into a blank stare, no smile and no greeting . At first i thought it was weird , and then my sister mentioned it too. I totally understand some people have bad days, but as someone who works in customer service their is no need to be mean during so. I genuinely do not understand how i warranted this as I smiled as we came in , maybe because i have a slight rbf ?. Maybe it was a bad day , i have those too I just hope they realize that although i was not deeply affected, others would. Great for shopping here. They have really nice collections. It's not just a women clothes store, they offer much more. Had a great experience shopping here. There were so many types of candles to choose from. My favorite out of the choices available were food smells like \"whip cream and pear\" or \"angle food cake\".\n\nHowever I wanted refreshing tones and got the candle in the picture. Best part was all candles are 30% off.\n\nThe wrapping service was good and the staff were friendly. \ud83d\ude04 Cashier: 344107 Was extremely rude and condescending to us. Didn't even bother to give us any ounce of kindness. Hopefully you fix this, unless it's Anthropologies philosophy to be a typical mean girl stereotype in a movie. Luckily the others on the floor were nice and welcoming but the cashier really left a tainted impression on our visit. Comfort of the wool shoes lives up to the hype. Store can be a little hectic with everyone running around, but the layout is done well and the staff and really responsive and knowledgeable about their products.\n\nAt the time all shoes of all models and colors were $90 which seems like a great deal. Time will tell how they stand up durability wise.\n\nLooking forward to see what other sustainable products/designs they come out with I am so passionate about their shoes. The staff is incredibly helpful and welcoming and really provide high quality service. The shoe selection is amazing and you won\u2019t find more comfortable and attractive casual shoes. Highly highly recommend. Great experience at Allbirds Back Bay! I stopped by today to purchase a pair of sneakers I saw on their website. I walked in and was warmly greeted by Julia who assisted me with my purchase. The entire experience/purchase was quick & easy! Julia was so friendly. The storefront is bright and inviting. And most importantly, the runners I got are SO comfortable!! Yay! I had the best experience!  I'm in town for business and forgot my comfy sneakers.  The staff fixed me right up and I wore them out the store Fantastic associates & customer service! They answered a lot of questions my mom and I had regarding the insoles and which shoes fit narrow feet better. Megan was personable, welcoming, and more than helpful. 10/10 recommend for customer service !! Stopped in while I was traveling and had a great experience! Cutest section of very versatile and staple pieces. Grabbed a couple pairs of earrings and I love that they don\u2019t break the bank for quality items. Sales associate was simply wonderful. Would definitely shop here again! Jewelry store that serves the younger crowd looking for modern styles of wearable 14k gold and previous and semi precious items. Store is bright, airy and well lit. Staff is super friendly always giving you time to browse and not hovering (like that store that has the light blue boxes and armed security guards following you around). Staff is knowledgeable about their items, what stones, what style, etc. We ended up buying a cute ring with teeny diamonds but super cute and reasonably priced.they even give you a free tote! Best store ever! The store manager, Sam, is so incredibly helpful and knows a lot about jewelry. She made my whole experience so easy and fun. Store is well staffed and stocked, and everyone working there is so nice and helpful. Went in for the first time and received amazing service, above what I expected. I had a broken necklace and they swapped it out no questions asked, which really built trust. I looked around and received very supportive assistance from Crystal. $700 later, I felt comfortable buying from a store that would back up their items no questions asked. Trust is key with jewelry you\u2019re investing in! Thanks! I\u2019ve gotten haircuts from multiple barbers here, and while they\u2019re all great, Zak is the one I keep going back to and would recommend. If you\u2019re trying to find someone who will consistently give you his best work, this is the guy. I went to Barbershop Lounge to get a beard trim / shave from Zak. The atmosphere is laid back with nice music and good conversation. Zak was super friendly and did a nice job with my beard. I would recommend Barbershop Lounge, and Zak specifically, for any shave / haircut needs you may have! Darrin is the Best!\n\nJust got a fantastic haircut from Darrin at Barber Shop Lounge, and I couldn\u2019t be happier! He did an amazing job\u2014very stylish and professional, exactly what I needed for my career in sales where looking sharp is key.\n\nThe entire staff is top-notch, super friendly, welcoming, and professional. You can tell they take pride in their work and care about their clients. The shop itself has a great vibe, and the location on Newbury St. is perfect\u2014I always grab lunch nearby after my cut!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great barber and a top-tier experience, I highly recommend Darrin and the team at Barber Shop Lounge. I\u2019ll definitely be back! \ud83d\udc88\ud83d\udd25 I have been coming to Barbershop Lounge on Newbury Street for years. My son went first and recommended it. Rosa has always been the one to cut my hair. She is THE BEST.  An artist with a scissors and razor, Rosa is a perfectionist who always makes me smile when I leave. Whatever event I have coming up, Rosa always makes me look and feel my best. I hate to say it, but I didn't have a good first experience with Gama. I brought pictures of the haircut I wanted as inspiration but he left me with something thicker and poofier than I wanted. When I prompted him to take my beard line lower, he looked incredulous and talked down on the idea. It wasn't a very collaborative discussion, and he was a bit rough with the comb. Finally, he left the back of my neck raw and inflamed from the shave. Amazing service, delicious food and great atmosphere. 10/10\u2b50\ufe0f\nOur server Brenda was awesome and made our dinner experience extra enjoyable!\nWe ordered oysters, tuna tartare, lobster roll, scallops and lobster dumplings.\nEverything was fantastic! This place doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nAlso extremely quick service. I went during Dine Out Boston and never offered that option. No problem I came to eat and enjoy great food.  The Clam Chowder Bread and Butter Coffee were on point the Rum and Coke drinks were great and then it fell off from there, the Potato Au Gratin was not good at all just bland wetness and the Seafood Cioppino good taste but overcooked the dessert meh.  I've been to this restaurant many times  and I'll go again but on that day they weren't running on all cylinders.  The staff is exceptionally good. Pretty fancy restaurant and well down for the lobster and chowder.\n\nPersonally, I find it a bit overpriced and very crowded. The parking is absolutely nightmare. However, great restaurant to try out in Boston on a date night.\n\nTips, you can order crab meat stuffed in lobster, apparently it\u2019s a hidden menu. Definitely impressed me lol The oysters were really good.  The lobster bisque was a little blend whereas the clam chowder was a little strong for our taste.  Likewise the lobster carbonara though there was plenty of lobster meat.  The service was very good.  Definitely worth a visit. Overall I thought the food was very salty.  It wasn\u2019t bad but I\u2019ve had better.  We drank like 2-3 bottles of water because of this.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and our waiter was fantastic.\n\nI was hoping the clam chowder would be better since is was supposedly rated one of the best but I guess everyone has different tastes\n\nWould I go back ?  Maybe maybe not since I feel there are so many other good restaurants. I always have a great experience at Edge Luxury Eyewear. They have the best variety in high end luxury brands like Cartier, Celine, Chrome Hearts, and Christian Dior just to name a few. Every time I go to the store I end up buying more than one pair at a time. There's plenty of eyewear stores in the area but none of them cater to urban fashion the way Edge does. I recommend this store to anyone looking to get the flyest frames in the game. Bought from them before. It was fine, although the temples were tarnishing after a year. I stopped shopping here after they questioned if I can afford frames here when I tried to enter. I buy my frames now across the street. Amazing detail and craftwork. I got matching Cartier shades for me and my fianc\u00e9. I got the blue belvoir shades for my nephew. I\u2019ll definitely keep shopping with edge luxury eyewear Great customer service, reasonable prices and quality luxury opticals/sunglasses. The shopping experience is stressfree and top notch. I always tell my friends/family about Edge Luxury Eyewear and will continue to support! I flew all the way to Boston from Atlanta. Great prices on all the frames. Great customer service and I will be back around the holidays to get another pair. Experience was amazing. Very professional and easy to set up a delivery/pickup time. Plus cheaper than most dry cleaners in the city that you would have to bring your clothes to. Definitely recommend if you have a busy schedule. absolutely nightmare experience. sent a winter coat for dry cleaning. it was returned with zipper buckle gone, holes in sleeve, scratch on the back, etc. it's so rough that I can't believe it's the same coat. yet the owner denied all the damages and didn't even apologize. extremely cold attitude. my coat is forever damaged, but you can still save yours by staying away from this store as far as possible. Not a good experience. Paid $30 for a pair of slippers to be cleaned while I was waiting to pick them up! He didn\u2019t even clean them well. There was also a customer in front of me arguing with the representative about her now damaged shoes. Not a good look. I won\u2019t be going back. Was only in town for a few days and needed a suit dry cleaned for a wedding in NC; They were able to accommodate my request in a timely fashion and I would recommend visiting them in Back Bay. The service was terrible. The clothes reached 2 days after the original delivery date and the work was not even done properly even after the delay. The clothes sent for dry clean were not properly cleaned and was not taken care of at all. They did not even fold the clothes. The same was repeated after these clothes were sent back for dry clean again. I was also told that I will be getting a refund which I still have not received and it has been over 2 weeks. This has pretty much been the worst experience and I definitely would not recommend. Emily was the sweetest. I did an impromptu home hair chop and needed a little TLC and she took the time to hear me out and give me direction on where we could take my new short hair. As someone without a solid idea on what I was asking for, I LOVE the result. Clean and cute salon too, I\u2019d definitely come back! Horatio is an absolute genius with color and cut. Trained in London, worked in NYC and Mexico- he brings cutting edge skills to styling. I recently moved from LA to Boston and had not found a stylist to match my previous person in CA - but thankfully I found Horatio. He is also an artist and an interesting conversationalist. Kind and caring. If you have a chance to have him do your hair - take it! #excellence #creative #professional #greatstylist I\u2019ve been here three times for haircuts with Horacio. The first two times I really liked my haircut and was willing to overlook the haircut starting 30-60 minutes late and taking 2 hours. This last time though, not only did the visit once again start late, he was clearly rushed starting halfway through when his next client arrived. He ended up the left side of my head a half an inch or so shorter than the right and with a blunt choppy end. I\u2019ve been growing my hair out for about 2 years now so not only am I going to have to spend time at another salon getting this fixed but I\u2019m going to lose extra length unnecessarily I\u2019ve been to Safar a few times with different stylists (they\u2019re all great), and last week was my first time with Horacio. And WOW! I have never felt so listened to by a hair stylist. He went above and beyond in doing what was best for my hair and giving me exactly what I wanted without adding any extra costs. I have a lot of hair, and hair stylists sometimes have to rush towards the end of my appointment, but Horacio was in no rush and took his time to give my hair the care that it desperately needed. He also was such an educator, I learned so much about my hair that I should\u2019ve learned years ago \u2014 how often to wash, what products to use, when to use which products, long term maintenance, etc. At the beginning of the appointment, I showed him pictures of what I had in mind, he explained his thought process/vision, and I put trust in him to execute. It came out so much better than I could\u2019ve imagined!\n\nHoracio was also such a kind soul and so genuine, I can\u2019t wait to catch up with him at my next appointment. If you\u2019re debating going to Safar or which stylist, I know that Horacio will not disappoint! I come here a few times a year to get a haircut with Stephanie and have never left dissatisfied! Appointments always start on time, she takes great care of me offering me a tea/coffee to start my day, and as someone who notices minor details I am always left happy with the symmetry of my cuts. Always look forward to my haircuts. I normally kind of loathe shopping. Also, this was my first and only visit to a Lucky store despite being aware of the company for over a decade. I hadn't planned to visit them. I was in the Newberry area looking for unrelated items when I spotted a sign at Lucky indicating a sale of 40% off the whole store. I saw they had winter shirts, so, I decided to stop in. I had no expectations. The first person to greet me was, I believe part of the management team. They were friendly, at ease, didn't try to 'get in to my space' and let me know what was what around the store. I felt ZERO pressure. As I looked about another team member came out. We found ourselves in a very pleasant conversation. Anyhow, I made my first try of a shirt the second associate suggested, new from a stack that hadn't even been put to the sales floor yet. The first shirt was a fabulous suggestion, but not quite personally right for me. Happy with the service, and recognizing that Lucky clothes were of good quality, I decided to look over more clothes. All in all I tried on about 5 shirts before settling in on one. I'm wearing it while I type this. 40% off makes the purchase even better. I eyed their belts also, but I simply don't need a belt right now. Great selections though. Anyhow, the whole of the experience was positive. I would shop Lucky in the future based on this days experience. This may be the only clothing store I've ever reviewed. If Lucky corporate ever reads this, my visit was on 11/13/2017 at around 2pm. There was one male and one female working. Whoever they are/were, they provided a good experience for me. For anyone else reading this, I'm not a corporate 'tool or an agent of Lucky'. I live in Houston (not in Boston) and I'm a photographer by trade. I was in Boston to visit a friend. Incredibly disappointed in the customer service I received today at the Newbury store. I bought a pair of jeans less than 6 months go and the zipper ripped part way out of the jeans yesterday. I went to the store to show them the jeans. I asked if it was possible for them to repair them considering I hadn't had them for very long, this was clearly an issue with the quality of the jeans AND they were over $100. I was told that they only guarantee their jeans for 60 days..... so $100+ pants are only supposed to last a few months?\n\nI was polite when I asked them if there was really nothing they could do to help me and then they rudely told me I could \"go find a tailor or something\".\n\nBefore this incident I highly recommended Lucky to all my friends but they have lost a customer for life. Staff were great, very helpful. The quality of their jeans however is pretty poor... I find they fall apart pretty quick compared to most other brands I've tried. Wouldn't recommend it to folks, especially given the price. It is a nice place, good selection of stuff. Employees were friendly and helpful. There is plenty of parking and is easy to find. Its worth checking out if you like licky brand. Rosa and Natalia were wonderful and very helpful in finding me jeans I loved. I just went to this store and have a great experience! I think I was attended by the manager a girl with a heart necklace and she is the very best! Attentive, very smart, genuinely kind and extremely efficient! Don\u2019t let her go FP Horrific experience. These people are rude and don\u2019t know retail. Why is there only one rack in the sale room that\u2019s actually on sale? Have fun paying at least $78 for products of sweatshops. I felt like a prisoner here, not a free person. Love this store, the ladies are always so sweet and helpful ! Amazing customer service! After receiving poor help making at return at Aritzia, it was refreshing to receive outstanding help at Free People!\n\nAfter walking over 2 miles to make a return, I was disappointed to find out that I brought the wrong receipt. However, Ivy, the sale associate, was able to look up my purchase. I am extremely thankful  to have received such great service. It truly made my day. Thank you Ivy! I will be purchasing more from free people in the future Lovely place. Great customer service. Shaun helped me find certain pieces and started a dressing room for me. Claudia was very nice and helpful as well. I enjoyed shopping here. BoConcept is one of a kind. Rania helped me to choose unique pieces for my home, she\u2019s outstanding and was very patient with me taking my time and making final decisions. Also all the people were very welcoming and nice here. Will absolutely consider buying from BoConcept again. Thank you very much! I want to start by saying that when my wife and I entered the Newbury St BoConcept, we were just going to look around but had were not looking to make a purchase but we fell in love with a sofa and our consultant was knowledgeable, attentive and went out of his way to help us figure out the best options. Everyone at this store worked with a smile on their face and helped in the process of making sure this was the right purchase for us. I would definitely recommend BoConcept Newbury Street, Boston. We were looking along Newbury Street for a few pieces of furniture to make our new office feel more comfortable for staff and guests. Even though our initial intention was window shopping for a bit inspiration and knowledge, it became a phenomenal session with BoConcept consultant Pardis.\n\nShe wasn't afraid to roll up her sleeves and dive deep into our needs, inspirations, and (most importantly) budget for this transformation.\n\nWhile the store and quality of furniture speaks for itself, it was Pardis and the rest of the staff's dedication to excellent customer service that I will look back upon. We made a lap down Newbury Street to try and pick out a couch, and were very happy we stopped by! Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They were kept us posted about options and upcoming promotions, and were patient and understanding with regards to our timelines and process. It has been an absolute pleasure working with Gaya from the Newbury BoConcept store.  From just a little input from us (including a floor plan) she was able to design our new living room and dining room all without requiring any commitment from us.  It is rare to find someone so helpful and detail oriented that doesn\u2019t put pressure on you.   She completed the first pass of the design very quickly (within days) and presented it to us in the store where we could see the objects, materials and design presentation.  We had asked her to pull us out of our color comfort zone and she did\u2026 she put together a design around a beautiful mustard colored couch.  But when she saw our hesitation on going with a bold color (we are your typical grey and neutral boring people even though we want to be bold design people) she went back to designing and offered us a new presentation.  This required her to change the colors of all objects.   She didn\u2019t mind this at all and prioritized our happiness.\n\nWe are incredibly analytical people that do not make decisions quickly.  Given this, we have gone in the store several times and just sat on the couch for 30+ minutes to make sure it was comfortable.  Every worker that we have met in both the Newbury store and the Cambridge store have been incredibly nice and made us feel welcome and comfortable while we were testing the products.  We even had our shoes off and were lying down on the couch and one of the owners (Louis) came over and asked us if he could get us some water.  Louis as well as all the other employees always offer to help us if we are in the store and Gaya isn\u2019t working.  They appear to support one another very well.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t felt comfortable going ahead with any purchase given our condo is getting built and we wanted to double check the dimensions and see how the color scheme would work.  Gaya offered to come with us to do this.  She carried two big tote bags of large fabric swatches all while wearing the required construction hat and vest\u2026 what a trooper.  But she knew this was what we needed to feel comfortable.\n\nI would highly recommend working with Gaya as well as the Newbury BoConcept store.  She is incredibly hard working and detail oriented while not putting pressure on the customer.  Additionally, she repeatedly goes the extra mile either by redesigning or going onsite or putting together the necessary pdfs, screenshots and documents.  What more could you ask for?   Additionally, the store is beautiful and well designed and Louis is incredibly knowledgeable and supportive of his staff. Visiting Boston for the week and I visited this amazing coffee shop nearly every day. The egg and cheese on a croissant with Canadian bacon, alongside a fresh batch of fruits, made my morning. My boyfriend and I would excitedly sing \u201chot toffee caramel\u201d on our walk there because that coffee scratched the itch like no other. The warmed up apple danish was a heavenly sweet to kickstart our day. The ambiance is super cute and fall-forward. The women working here are so sweet, kind, friendly. So happy to support this local business, and the mornings without a hot toffee caramel coffee are just so blah now. Bittersweet Shoppe on Newbury is the cutest coffee shop in town! The iced coffees are delicious, often shaken to a cold perfection. Check out the decorations and treats all year around. My husband loves their homemade lemonades and the grilled cheeses are the best!  Can\u2019t say enough good things!  The owner is so nice and d kind. Highly recommend!! One of my favorite spots on Newbury with a fun, small town coffee shop vibe.\n\nHaving frequented this shop for a year, Sunday mornings at Bittersweet have almost become a ritual for me. On days with good weather, the place could get extremely crowded, so I either come early in the mornings or order for a takeout.\n\nIt was their cinnamon sticky bun iced coffee that first caught me by surprise. Since then, I\u2019ve been coming back to try their array of distinctive flavored iced coffees and lattes. Yes, they are sweet, and the idea of sipping on flavors like iced sugar cookie or strawberry shortcake might initially sound appalling. Nevertheless, it\u2019s always nice to have something fun once in a while, and they are great for a quick and invigorating sugar rush in the mornings.\n\nFood-wise, expect comforting staples adorned with the quintessential Newbury price tag. Although dubbing them \"gourmet\" might be stretching it, there's no denying that they\u2019re solid snacks. So far, I\u2019ve tried their Tuna melt sandwich and the Boston baked bean hot dog, and both were good.\n\nOverall, a refreshing divergence from generic coffee shop mold. If you're wandering Newbury and in need of a caffeine and sugar kick with a side of comfort, this is your spot. NOTE: This is for their lemonade booth stand they had by the Boston Public Library.\n\nIt was so good and refreshing on a hot day. The female staff was professional and courteous. When I saw all the bees buzzing around their stand, I know that likely would mean fresh ingredients and natural ingredients. I was not wrong. It was so good. I not too sweet. I now need to pop into the cafe, and review that. They took cash and cards, so super convenient.\n\nMaybe they will do a hot chocolate and hot cider booth in the fall?\n\nUpdate to come on the cafe itself.... Cozy, nice spinach and feta roll, and very well done chai. They have alternative milk. And the place is lovely (inside and outdoor seating). I came here for the first time looking for a few outfits for my 18-month-old as well as for gifts for several baby showers. The women working there were so helpful and I found what I was looking for! All of the products were well thought out during the buying process by the owner. There are some more expensive items, but there are also reasonably priced items (for a children's boutique). Will definitely come back. The selection of infant and toddler clothing is excellent. They have many brands to select from and a wide variety of items for both boys and girls. This is not a discount store but prices are in a reasonable range for the quality. I found what I was looking for - a baby shower gift and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for this type of baby or toddler clothes. Lauren and her team were absolutely wonderful with getting a gift card for one of our clients!  With many bumps in the road on my end, they went above and beyond to get us exactly what we needed! Thank you! High quality, high end children's items at the price you'd expect (or even more). Great for a gift or one or two special items. Probably not where you'd buy your every day essentials, unless money is no object. Such a cute little store with high quality products!\nPerfect if you want a unique gift The space is eye candy and they treat you like royalty here!  I walked in for the first time and Niki gave me the red carpet treatment!  She\u2019s amazing!  \u2600\ufe0f\n\nOutside of the aura, it\u2019s easy to tap into a state of flow and be productive in this space.  Love it! \u2764\ufe0f This is my favorite workspace in town when I visit Boston. The space is beautiful. There is always a fully stocked fridge with plenty of snacks and low levels of distractions.  In the summer, the balcony provides fantastic views of the Charles and Cambridge, and is a great place to get some work done while you are sitting in the sun. Great location with tons of light, friendly team, and nice co-working peers. Great co-working space with a wonderful design and friendly people.  Membership is all-inclusive so it's easy to set up and get working:  desks / chairs included, reception, basic office supplies, meeting space, printing, and can't forget the coffee and free snacks. This space also has a balcony, so it's great to get fresh air or sit outside during your breaks.\n\nRE: COVID and cleaning.  The team here has worked very hard to implement clean and safe protocols.  We looked at a few other spaces that didn't have as stringent protocols in place.  They have temperature checks, all members sign a pledge, and visitors are asked to verify no prior exposure.  There's a porter who constantly is cleaning and wiping down surfaces.  Many offices have sliding windows, so you can air out your personal space. While of course nothing is a catch-all, I think they're doing their best to implement multiple \"swiss cheese\" layers.  Networking and mingling events now are cancelled, but they try to make things fun with events like donut day. :) Amazing office space!  This is the best run office I have been in, either as full corporate office or Co-Working.  The Industrious Office model will likely take over traditional long-term office leases.  We spent ZERO time setting up tedious items like kitchen, conference rooms, wifi, servers, etc.  Annie, the Office Manager runs an amazingly efficient, accurate and uplifting office space.  It has been particularly helpful providing the energy for our younger analysts who can network and socialize with other peers and not feel isolated in a small office for just one company.  All in all, I cannot say enough good things about the space and Annie who runs the office. I had an exceptional experience with Mark, a salesperson at Mattress Firm in Back Bay, Boston. His service was outstanding\u2014personal, friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive without being pushy. Remarkably, I never met Mark in person; all our interactions were over the phone, yet his sincerity made the experience comfortable and trustworthy. He took the time to understand my needs\u2014a mattress for a rental unit, needed as soon as possible\u2014patiently answered all my questions, and helped me find the perfect mattress. I highly recommend Mark to anyone; his exceptional customer service is second to none. Thank you, Mark, for your kind and dedicated help! Amazing help to choose the perfect mattresses for our new apartment even while out of state! Arrangement for delivery and perfect completion of the sales process made buying from this mattress firm effortless and successful! I had a fantastic experience shopping for a mattress thanks to Mark! He was incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to understand my needs, guiding me to the perfect choice. His expertise and patience made the process so much easier, and I truly appreciated his recommendations. If you\u2019re looking for great customer service and someone who knows their stuff, I highly recommend asking for Mark! I and friends went to get the mattress from Lou who has the greatest service and knowledge about the mattress and we got the right one. He is very expert. We had a great experience working with Lou during our mattress shopping trip! He took the time to walk us through all of our options, explaining the differences in a way that was both clear and helpful. Lou was incredibly knowledgeable and really listened to us and our concerns, which made us feel confident in the process.\n\nHe was patient as we tested multiple mattresses, and it was clear he genuinely wanted to help us find the perfect fit\u2014not just make a sale. Thanks to Lou, what could have been a stressful decision turned into an enjoyable and informative experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping for a mattress, we can\u2019t recommend Lou enough. He\u2019s professional, attentive, and truly cares about his customers\u2019 satisfaction! I had an outstanding experience at Bank of America on 855 Boylston St. in Boston, thanks to Senior Banker Panashe Ngwenya. She went above and beyond to assist me and was extremely professional throughout the process.\n\nAs a self-employed individual, I really appreciated how knowledgeable she was, especially when it came to the business side of things. She helped me set up my online banking and took the time to explain everything step by step, making sure I understood and could take full advantage of all the benefits offered.\n\nPanashe was very patient and thorough, and she made me feel confident that opening both my personal and business accounts with Bank of America was the right decision. I left feeling very happy and assured that my business is in good hands.\n\nHighly recommend Panashe and this branch! The worse notary service I\u2019ve ever seen!\nI brought my financial statements required  only my signature to be notarized. The clerk was not satisfied with the number of pages first, second with printing format when I told its not a big deal to put the last number of page with a pen and put my initials there which is common sense. Well, I went to the post office next door and I got what I should\u2019ve gotten in a second. \u201cThx! for your useless work!\u201d I've been of BOA customer for 10+ years, and am now considering closing my accounts because of how poorly this branch is run.  Half the time there's no one there to talk to without waiting in the line for the teller which can take an extremely long time.  I've gone in there and been told I'll have to wait an hour to speak with a teller when there are only a handful of people in line.  And roughly half the time I go there to get cash changed into quarters so I can do laundry I get told they have no quarters.  There are no other branches with tellers within walking distance because they all are closed or removed their tellers.  Always a terrible experience. My husband made an appointment to come in and have a check book printed. One hour after he arrived, he was informed the printer isn't working. What a joke. Just last week we scheduled a call to discuss a home loan and the rep called us almost three hours after the scheduled call. We'll be switching banks. Very slow.\nThere are lots of staff hovering around; they look busy, and maybe they are. Marionettes can look busy too, and they would be just about as helpful to you and the other six people waiting in line for the one harried teller as the hovering staff end up being. If you must do business with a teller at this branch, maybe get a coffee or something before you go in. Best customer service I've had anywhere in a very long time. Kyle demonstrated what I thought had been lost in our society, true above and beyond customer service until the customer is happy, mission accomplished and is also walking out of the store with the much desired device. $90/mo plan $19 protection=$119. I am being billed $156 and everytime I call get inaccurate info. I set calendar alerts and notifications a week before and the day of. Unacceptable. Zero transparency and am hit with fees.\n\nAfter much effort this was rectified. Save your documentation and call them and ask for verification emails and download myverizon app. Wilfredo was above and beyond! Nobody wants to have to walk in to the Verizon store because things are messed up on their account. But if you do, make sure it\u2019s when Wilfredo is running the show!\nHe was tackling our issue (which took a call to the internal support team), while helping someone else through their weird billing issue, all while making sure the other technicians had what they needed.\nYou could tell he knew a heck of a lot more than is in a training guide and he actually enjoyed pulling apart a tricky problem and getting a resolution for a customer. If your mobile carrier is VERIZON WIRELESS, please visit the store on Boylston St.  Z the rep there helped me !!! THEY ARE THE BEST !!! Thank you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Super low energy, not super friendly, sales.  Like they are being forced to work with customers. A nice variety of different truffles that are hand delivered from Switzerland. If you\u2019re looking for different chocolates from what they sell at the general stores, this is a place to check out. A hidden gem in a quite busy area, it\u2019s easy to miss... but worth a visit. Just be prepared to pay a little more than you\u2019d expected for standard chocolate or candy. For someone who\u2019s a chocolate fanatic, I would recommend going somewhere else. The quality was mediocre and very pricey for what it was. The dark chocolate candy bar is definitely more milk chocolate than dark chocolate if that\u2019s the taste you\u2019re going for. The staff were helpful. Overall, it\u2019s a lovely little shop but the quality of the chocolate could be improved. Small little shop on Newbury that my friends and I visited on a whim and ended up falling in love with. Staff were very helpful and patient, and the store itself offers a variety of chocolate bars, gift boxes, fun shaped chocolates, and delicious truffles with a variety of unique flavors. The gift boxes are amazing gifts to try a variety of their different unique truffle flavors, such as jasmine, rose, lavender, Bailey's, vodka, and others! I personally tried the jasmine, rose, and lavender and loved that the flavor was not overpowering and tasted very authentic, not chemical-y at all. I usually don't care for chocolate but this is a must-visit! Unmatched quality, great taste. However, I would say they\u2019re pretty pricey. But wait, it\u2019s worth every penny considering how heavenly their chocolates taste. I went in for the dark truffles because I don\u2019t generally prefer any additions to my chocolate and they were to die for. Simple and modest. If you\u2019re looking to splurge (both dollar bills and calories lol) on some chocolate at any point in time, definitely get yourself to Teuscher and you will not regret it. This store is pure happiness to go into. It's decorated beautifully, there is the smell of chocolate in the air, and there is wonderful service. I bought the orange chocolate bar, two milk chocolate caramels, and dark chocolate almond clusters that were all delicious. I can't wait to visit again and try more of their treats. My retail therapy fix! Always great service, beautiful selections, and at a price point for all.  Discovered this gem when I first arrived in Boston and my go to spot.  Was beyond blown away by the service I received today. Although closing shortly the associates did not rush my us and were beyond hospitable.  My deepest gratitude and can't wait to wear my new selections. This store is really cute. The clothes are well priced and the quality is great. I take a star off because the staff is very unwelcoming. Definitely mean girl vibes. I worked in retail for a long time and would be disappointed if this was my staff. They don't greet customers or help you in anyway - in fact they ignore you and act annoyed when they have to check you out. Other than that - great store! cute items and store layout. many stained or damaged somehow in store inventory. staff incredibly rude and unnecessarily patronizing. return not accepted for a stain which was already there from the store itself.  overall lack of care, understanding, and customer service. items additionally unnecessarily overpriced and poor quality long term Poor quality. Bought a sweater here and ripped at the arm first wear. I was never more insulted than I was just a few moments ago by the \u201cstore manager\u201d at this store then I can recall in recent memory.   I had landed in Boston a few short hours before having lunch with my daughter, who attends university in Boston, and we were poking around in this store to possibly buy something.  My daughter had an armload of things (less than 8) and wanted to try them on.  I entered the dressing room with her to sit because I was exhausted from traveling and was told no more than 2 people.  I sort of rolled my eyes, thinking ok I\u2019m her mother, not Bonnie and Clyde and informed her that We were mother and daughter.  The so called manager indicated to me that I would be surprised by how many mother and daughter theives there are!! The boldness of this accusation, no innuendo here, was insulting and offensive!!!  Left the store on the spot.   No apology offered, no attempt to mend the insult.  Horrible disgrace that the management of this store has zero filter or the ability to gauge the clientele.  I have been treated far better in most places then No Rest for the Awful\u2026 I bought a Model One BT and couldn't be happier - beautiful design and really nice sound. You can buy Tivoli products from lots of resellers but I recommend buying directly from Tivoli because of the great customer service. They have a 30-day return policy which I needed to use; I ordered the wrong color and Ross, the customer service representative, was extremely knowledgeable, professional and helpful. I quickly had my refund; Ross even alerted me that it had been processed and I ordered the correct color. A great experience all around! Great store, helpful team.  Purchased a Model One Digital and have been loving it. Called at 3:15 pm on a Sunday and the message machine said they were closed after they said they close at 6 pm on Sunday? My husband surprised me with a day spa package for my birthday, which included a massage, mani, and pedi\u2014all in one convenient location. It was a thoughtful idea, and I really appreciated the gesture.\n\nThe massage was decent, though I\u2019ve had better experiences elsewhere. What I\u2019m really here to talk about, though, is the mani-pedi service. Without naming names, let\u2019s just say it was not up to par. My cuticles weren\u2019t properly trimmed, the nail shaping was uneven, and the polish application left a lot to be desired. For the price my husband paid, I would expect much better quality and attention to detail.\n\nTo make matters worse, the process took nearly 2.5 hours, which felt excessive. By the end, I wasn\u2019t relaxed or satisfied\u2014I was just ready to leave.\n\nWould I return? Unfortunately, no. While the idea of the gift was lovely, the execution at this spa missed the mark. Serene day spa tht you wish had a posh hotel attached to it because its absolutely the utopia of all spas. Shout-out to Stephanie, aka Denise!!!  She's my fairy God mother she's an educator, a mentor all wrapped in a blanket of love. Stephanie has taught the meaning of being pro active and how to survive my 30s but make it fabulous! G2O you hit gold! It was time for a change and I wanted a high-end experience. Many years ago I was gifted a fabulous massage at G2O Spa, so I knew a haircut here would be just what I needed! I read about their team members and decided on Darren Le. From the moment he said hello I knew I was in great hands; I wasn't even nervous about chopping off 5 inches! He took his time speaking w me and saw my vision. He is truly an artist, w a keen eye for detail.\nI absolutely love my haircut and it is exactly what I envisioned. Thank you, Darren! After hearing from my co workers at Lash L'Amour that I absolutely had to try G20 , I had a facial with Tricia today.\n\nThe only bad part about it , is it ended!!  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The amenities at G20 are fantastic.   I'm a big fan of the massage chairs.\nI'll definitely be back. G2O is a rip off .. they are not considerate, don\u2019t put customers first ! And only think about the money they take from customers. My sister and her husband had an appointment and they called whiles right there and finding parking which is a complete mess in the neighborhood. They charged her a 50% of what they were supposed to consider upon her explaining the situation. The manager hanged the call when she even wasn\u2019t done talking. Such an unprofessional attitude!!! If you\u2019re a dog parent in Boston, Pawsh in Back Bay is a must-visit. My French bulldog, Dolce, absolutely loves this place\u2014it\u2019s one of her favorite stops on our daily walks. In fact, we pop in almost every day just to say hi and grab a treat. My Frenchie is very stubborn and won\u2019t reroute without stopping at Pawsh. The staff is always so welcoming, and they treat Dolce like the VIP (Very Important Pup) that she is! Mike and Nancy, the owners, are amazing\u2014they genuinely care about every dog that comes through their doors. It\u2019s clear the founded Pawsh with love, and their passion for pets shines through everything they do.\n\nWhat makes Pawsh truly special is their mix of high-quality products and top-notch grooming services. From stylish collars and cozy beds to durable toys and gourmet treats, they have everything a spoiled pup could want. Their selection of dog apparel is also perfect for a fashionable pooch\u2014especially when Boston\u2019s weather gets frigid and unpredictable.\n\nBeyond the great shopping choices, their grooming services are excellent. They take such great care of their four-legged clients, and it\u2019s clear they know how to make dogs feel comfortable and look their best. Whether it\u2019s a fresh bath, a trim, or the perfect pawdicure, they do an amazing job every time. I know it can be difficult to get an appointment but with limited space and the availability of their groomers they do the best they can to accommodate your pups needs.\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s the warm, friendly atmosphere that keeps us coming back. The staff is always happy to help, offer recommendations, and\u2014most importantly\u2014spoil Dolce with love and treats. If you\u2019re in Back Bay and looking for a pet store that truly cares about your furry friend, Pawsh is the place to go! The best!! Everyone is so kind and the grooming is great. They keep the dogs for 2-3 hours and are consistent with calling/texting when they are almost done and done I have been going to Pawsh for about 13 years with two different dogs and I have probably left hundreds of glowing reviews for them. But I do feel like the place has recently changed. They have one award-winning groomer there, one that I have never met, and the other one that I Can\u2019t say anything nice about. If you have a young  And healthy dog, you will be welcome at Pawsh and probably have a good experience. But I have an aged dog with only three legs, and they refuse to groom him anymore. They actually told me that in order to groom a three legged dog, a Veterinarian has to Be present. I was afraid I would never find Another groomer, but after speaking to at least two other groomers I have found out that is Not the case. After 13+ years of being a patron I would\u2019ve at least expected some honesty. I\u2019ve been bringing my dog Louie to Pawsh for over a year now. Magdalena has been Louie\u2019s only groomer throughout and she has been amazing. She knows how to handle Louie and the grooming always turn out perfect! My pup love  her groomer ever 2 weeks he gets it done  great prices  good doggy clothes  and treats..\ud83d\udc15\ud83d\udc36 Small but tightly packed below street level shop selling mostly classical CDs, vinyl records, books and sheet music.  Almost everything is used. CDs are very keenly priced starting at a dollar and most boxed sets very cheap.  Very strong opera / vocal range, and friendly staff when I visited.  Most of the stock is good quality, major label releases.  Musicals and DVDs as well.\n\nAnother update, March 2024. Still open, but only 3 days a week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday IIRC - could be Thursday not Tuesday).  Only taking cash. I've always been the only customer whenever I've visited - I really hope that they can keep going.. I've been going to this store since I was 12 and in the 20 years since, the deals and bargains at this gem have remained consistent and the collection of used classical music recordings has never disappointed and has always been of the highest quality! Buy as many recordings and scores as you can to make sure stores like this stay open long into the future! Super friendly staff. Fun selection of opera scores and tons of other stuff. Some covers are a little beat up but the content looked great in everything I saw. Recently went and bought 12 records for pretty cheap, isn't closed anymore! The store maybe permanently/temporarily closed. Call first before you visit. Got this picture from my visit Aug 3, 2023. Spiro is so so helpful and provided great support. He responded to my query very quickly and we spoke on the phone to navigate my order all the way from the UK. Thank you so much! Defo recommend! These guys are great. From the UK I order wine / champagne to be delivered to my family in Boston. It gets done. No fuss, great communications, no hassle, quick delivery. Wish we had one like you near me here in the UK! Great choice too, some really nice and interesting wines and more. I want to come browse your store next time I'm in Boston! Based on reviews, had pretty high hopes.  Not the case at all - terribly depressing atmosphere, dark and dreary place, no selection of recognizable / trusted wines I.e, Jordan, Hartford Court, etc. Great shop, owners were funny and polite and very helpful Best selection in town, and free delivery! The place is always charmingly decorated, and there's an absolutely precious cat that lives at the store. Unintentionally went on black Friday and got a 20% discount!! The workers were super nice and if you spend over $50 you get something for free, which I got a Kirby hand cream!\n\nI was very happy to see they had kikuo merchandise! Unfortunately I'm dissapointed with how the keychains turned out. The black keychain had broken off and you can see there's evident scratches :( Same with the invisible keychain, there's clear scratches on it which made me sad.\n\nHowever the bag and shake-y keychain came out well! Only a make up stain was on the bag but I was able to clean it up. I wish I took a photo of the kikuo stand for anyone who's a fan and wants to know the selection.. the keychains are stocked, however the price seems high \ud83d\ude22 regardless I had so much fun! I enjoyed my shopping experience at Reiwatakiya very much. I recognized some of the brands I used to purchase when I lived in Japan and it brought me back. The cosmetics are reasonably priced for being imported from Japan and Korea. The sales person assisted me with finding the perfect match of a cushion foundation recommended a black liquid eye liner, and helped me find some skin care products too. I also picked up some snacks for my son which he of course loved. I wish I had purchased more but now I have an excuse to go back. The Asia Store, which sells all stuff we see in the Asia instagram reels. Fun visit, I loved the fact about community engagement and loyalty Asian people have for their culture and products.\n\nA great pop up experience. just kinda wish the workers were more interactive with customers but overall such a cute store:) I really really do like this store and wish they had more locations but this one in particular is WAY too small and gets overwhelmingly crowded quickly. A lot of the testers are missing or in bad condition which makes it difficult to try stuff before you buy, or if they do have a tester, they'll probably be out of stock for that specific shade. That being said I love that they have &honey products as well as a lot of affordable K/J beauty skincare and makeup options. I just wish they could move to a larger store and do a bit better making sure testers are available and useable. Be careful buying shoes at this store! Their exchange/return policy is a joke. Worst shopping experience ever.\n\nI purchased a pair of shoes a week ago (on weekend). It was a bit too small and caused a bruise on my heel. I couldn't return it on the same day because I was already too far away with my dating partner when the bruise bled. I literally had to change to another shoes I bought on the same day.\n\nNow I have time this weekend to exchange them for a larger size. But the store manager declined my request by saying that the shoes are too worn to be donated?? They also suspected that I was wearing their shoes for the whole week before exchanging. Why should I keep wearing a pair of shoes that damaged my feet within miles of walking?? It sounds so absurd to me and these shoes are utterly of no use to me. Glad they were only $60 so I didn't lose too much. Never buy Vans again in my life.\n\nEDIT: Added a less explicit photo of the damage. I probably should just throw them away. There\u2019s one guy in there, his name is Dejon , and in terms of customer service; he\u2019s the best part. Very professional and knowledgeable of the product and sales. The store is also nice too. My issue is everyone ,but that gentleman, makes my presence in the store very uncomfortable. I passionately like Vans products so I find myself in there from time to time that\u2019s how Dejon knows me. The other employees treat me differently as if I am bothering them. I was in there today buying a skateboard and a young lady I had asked for help just became more and more passively frustrated with helping me. I asked for sizes in three shoes, she also wouldn\u2019t let me look at the skateboards unless I wanted to buy it. She said I couldn\u2019t touch them so idk how I\u2019m supposed to pick a board if I can\u2019t touch them. Love the shoes - always a decent price with great selection - but they don't carry common sizes for all the designs. My son wears a 10.5, which is very common, but the first 3 shoes he wanted to try on, they didn't have them, which was strange. He did end up with shoes he loves, but I feel that maybe the inventory management can be a little more diligent. No point in having a great selection if the size you want in 3 different styles is out. So one star off for that (reluctantly).\n\nHowever, the scarcity of sizes might just be due to the pandemic, so we'll cut them a break. Love the custom section and the up-and-coming designers. Especially love that Vans is and has always been bold enough to use fabrics other than leather and canvas in their sneakers (velvet, velour, corduroy, tweed, etc.). Still a great skater shoe, and a prime location in which to sell them. The most unwelcoming, u helpful and downright rude Vans employees I\u2019ve experienced anywhere in the world!\n\nHaving shopping in Vans stores across North America and Europe. This is the worst! Purely based off the staff who let the company down completely (staff on shift 4pm on 12th October 2024). They lost over $500 in sales today just from us.\n\nBoston Vans\u2026 we\u2019re never coming back! Love this location and the staff super friendly and helpful Nice selection in the humidor room. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Very helpful and knows the cigars. Great service. Recently having relocated to Boston, I was on the lookout for a solid vape/smoke shop in the area.\n\nAfter reading countless reviews, I settled on City Smoke Shop on Newbury Street. I\u2019m glad I stopped in. The selection here is astounding! It is A LOT to take in! I say this as a frequent customer of vape/smoke shops.\n\nThey have a massive selection of glassware, glass bowls/connectors, bangers, torches, butane, lighters, pipes, vaporizers, eCigs, rolling trays, wraps, papers, cones, hookah, cigarettes, and every other smoking/vaping product out there!\n\nThey have a massive selection of refillable vaporizers. They also have a ton of coils, so you know it won\u2019t be an issue finding them when needed. Juice options are limited due to State Laws against flavors, aside from tobacco.\n\nThey do have a small humidor with a small selection of cigars. It\u2019s clear this isn\u2019t a super popular product here. The quality and selection of the cigars was so-so. I saw quite a few cracked/damaged cigars while browsing the humidor.\n\nThe rep who helped me was incredibly kind and patient, wish I got his name! I spent over an hour just walking the store and taking in the massive selection. It took me another hour to decide on what exactly I was going to buy.\n\nI settled on a Caliburn G2 \u201cpod mod\u201d to replace my leaky VUSE Alto. I\u2019m also not a big fan of Juul due to quality issues, so it was nice to have a large variety of pod mods.\n\nI also picked up a two-pack of 1.2ohm Pod Cartridges. It\u2019s always smart to have a few extras on hand! Juice wise, you\u2019re extremely limited to tobacco-only flavors. This is state law. Due to this, I asked for the closest juice to Juul or VUSE. I decided on the NKD 100 \u201cEuro Gold\u201d Salt e-Liquid.\n\nThe selection and knowledge is phenomenal. They\u2019re also open late. I stopped in on a Saturday evening and they were open until 11PM. It\u2019s nice having a spot open late with a huge selection!\n\nMy only reason for reducing it to four-stars is two reasons:\n\n1. Price - The other reviews are true. The prices here are out of touch with reality. I get you have to make a profit. 3-4x markup is insanity. $59 for a $21 device is taking advantage. $20 for a $5 two-pack of coils is just being a bit out of touch. Everything is marked up at least 2-3x times. The receipt doesn\u2019t even match the price sticker on the item. All sales are final, so I won\u2019t even bother bringing it up.\n\n2. Humidor - I understand cigars aren\u2019t their main draw. However, dry and cracked cigars are a bad look and are not smokable. They need to dispose of damaged items and ensure humidor is set properly. Introducing more options would also be welcomed! The selection wasn\u2019t terrible, but could be improved.\n\nIf they came down a bit in price, they\u2019d have the solid 5-Stars. I just have a hard time accepting being charged $59+ for a device that is sold for around $20-$25. I did verify all products were legitimate with the manufacturer.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a smoke/vape shop with a ginormous selection and knowledgeable staff, be sure to swing by and check them out! Just be aware of the pricing- that is the only drawback. There are quite a few City Smoke Shops throughtout greater Boston and this one was well-stocked and had the most helpful employee working the day I stopped in. Would definitely go back! Bought hundreds of dollars of glass over time from here (even a $300 bong at one point), but after an employee was weird and homophobic to a customer, I stopped shopping here.\n\nAlso have had multiple occasions where an employee got angry and pushy with me when I asked to see a vape but didn\u2019t buy it. Like, sorry I didn\u2019t want to spend money on something I didn\u2019t want?\n\nThey knew basically nothing about the products they were selling, so it felt pointless to ask any questions about anything on display.\n\nThere are plenty of other smoke shops literally within a mile or two. Skip this one. Absolutely Iconic and the glass is amazing! We just bought a cute yoshi piece and the customer service from Shan is 100/10 Recently had such a great experience with stylist Vickie! I booked through Groupon and was nervous I\u2019d be treated differently but Vickie was amazing. She was so knowledgeable and kind. My hair came out beautiful and I will be returning ! I\u2019ve been coming here for a while now, and Vickie is my absolute go-to for haircuts! She always knows exactly what I need, even when I\u2019m not sure how to describe it. Whether I\u2019m looking for a trim or a fresh new style, she nails it every time! If you're looking for someone who truly understands hair and will make you look and feel amazing, book with Vickie. She\u2019s the best! Cannot recommend Vickie enough - I came in with an accidental rainbow head of hair following a series of unfortunate at-home attempts to dye my hair black (see before and after pictures). She worked her magic and absolutely saved the day; I left with a beautiful reddish brown color and a fresh trim. I will be coming back to her again and again :) I saw Vickie Villante for a colour correct/tone/low lights and was so happy! Vickie really reassured me and made me feel so comfortable and explained what was going on with the colour of my hair and what she was going to do to fix. It's tough going somewhere new for your hair and trusting they'll fix it, but she made the whole experience incredible and I couldn't be happier!!! Highly recommend Vicki at Michael Albor Salon back bay! I am very picky about who I let do my color and Vicki absolutely nails it every single time. Whether your are looking to do a balayage or highlights, I have done both with Vicki and she always takes the time to help me achieve the exact colour/shade I am going for!! She is also the absolute sweetest - always have the best experience. We drove 1.5 hours to Royce after friends of ours recently went to Royce in New York and brought us back a box.  The woman working there was not friendly, and not helpful at all.  We purchased $167 worth of chocolate so we could give some as gifts.  This chocolate is very expensive.  Here is the reason we probably will not go back to this store.  As we checked out and paid, the woman slowly slid two red paper bags into our bag.  She had already put chocolates in a pinkish bag so we didn\u2019t understand why she was sliding red paper bags into our larger bag.  We never asked for these bags, yet there is a 20 cents charge each for these bags for a total of 40 cents, plus a .2 cents charge for a MA paper bag fee which we didn\u2019t notice until we left.  Again, we never asked for them, and she never mentioned a charge.  We felt this was very insulting and petty to do given the fact we just spent $167 on chocolates, and we are charged for 2 paper bags we never asked for, and which were not even being used, and not even opened.  All chocolates were already in a larger bag so putting two unopened red bags into that bag, and charging us for them seems petty and odd.  This experience was not comfortable for us at this location.  Customer service is lacking here.  Hope they enjoy that extra .42 cents they got from us.  The $167 wasn\u2019t enough I guess.  Check your receipt before you leave. I love Royce chocolate! They have a wonderful selection of Japanese chocolates. But the customer service at this store was horrible. The woman working was very rude. When I asked her a question about 2 different types of chocolate, she rolled her eyes and cut me off and said \u201cThey\u2019re basically the same.\u201d She did not answer any further questions and walked away from me. When I was checking out, she rushed me as I was entering my email for a receipt and did not let me finish entering my information so I never got a receipt. She was also rude to another couple that walked in while I was shopping. While the chocolate here is delicious, the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Royce chocolate shop offers luxury sweets...\nI can't believe they've in my neighborhood since 2016... But I never knew it. The Japanese care as much about food presentation, as they do taste, and Royce delivers them both\u2026 perfectly!\n\n1. The staff is welcoming, friendly, and highly educated about chocolate\u2026 and Japan.\n\n2. The shop\u2019s vibe is laid back, friendly and inviting.\n\n3. Their chocolate displays are minimalist, colorful, and organized.\n\n4. Their customer loyalty program is customer friendly.\n\n5. The backstory and history, of Royce Chocolates, is worth learning.\n\nBUT\u2026 let's hear about their amazing chocolate confections: highest quality ingredients; melt in your mouth; rich; colorful; intense; unique; gift-worthy; pretty  packaging.\n\nTHE DEAL: if you're looking for a gift, for the friend who has it all, shop here. If they like chocolate... they'll love ROYCE chocolates from Japan! Very chiche interior.  Staff are friendly and knowledgeable.  I'm not a  fan of over sweet cheap chocolate. The chocholate here is very high quality and made with natural ingredients. I enjoy chocolate on the bitter side and they had quite a few options. I snagged a few things and will def come here again based off the yummy samples I tried. Japanese chocolate shop that specializes in milk chocolates.\nRoyce chocolates have been one of my favorites chocolates ever since I tried them in Tokyo couple of years ago, and I was excited to find their store in Boston. Their soft texture is a huge differentiating factor from other generic or European chocolates, and although the prices are double what you would pay for in Japan, they were still worth getting. They still had a fence right near the entrance to limit in store shopping, so it was somewhat difficult to browse through their menu. Nevertheless, I will come back to get my favorite milk chocolates and their new flavors.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of soft chocolates, I recommend trying them out. So extremely comfortable, and some of the best beds\u2026 I\u2019m so glad that I came in. I had help from Matt and he was above and beyond helpful! Truly superb experience. The owner, Matt, was incredibly knowledgeable, helpful and went above and beyond to fix a small problem. We didn\u2019t spend a whole lot compared to most of his clients, but he still treated us with top notch service. If you are looking for a luxury or natural bed, look no further. Thanks again, Matt! I bought a bed from Boston luxury Beds and it was an outstanding experience.  Top notch customer service,  Matt bent over backwards to make sure everything was right. unprofessional and aggressive. hostile staff with short temper and anger issues. don\u2019t be surprised if Matt cusses you out. The people inside is not friendly and make you feel not good.\nThey only have a few pillow and you cannot try the size you want to buy. And if you want to buy online from its website, it still don't allow you to return. They don't have the goods for people to try and don't allow people to exchange or return, I don't get the meaning of having a physical store. I was so excited to finally get to the store. The store is beautiful and it was so nice to be able to try shoes on instead of guessing what size I took. Kim waited on me she was, Very pleasant, helpful and patient. She even encourage me to make the most of my experience by trying on both shoes as I sampled a few sizes and styles.\nAll the employees in the store had great energy and were cheery and welcoming. I was excited to be able to receive a limited addition tote bag as well. I will be back again and again and again! I just love this store!!! The Staff is Amazing!!!\n\nI\u2019ve been here a handful of times over the last few years. I tend to order online as I know my size in my favorite styles. But I like to go into the store, now and then, to try on new styles and touch and experience shoes and bags IRL.\n\nEvery time I visit I\u2019m so please with the enthusiasm and positive energy of the staff. Kim and Sam waited on myself and my (adult foster) daughter. They were so accommodating and knowledgeable. It\u2019s so refreshing to deal with a team that truly loves what they do and more so it\u2019s apparent that they love the product too.\n\nKiddos Rothy\u2019s Team! You made my day as usual. not only do they have the most comfy and cute shoes, but their customer service is wonderful. I left my keys in their store which had closed by the time I realized. Before they even officially opened the next morning, they gave me a call (found my information through my air tag) and offered to Fed Ex them back to me free of charge, since I was only in town for the weekend. That is SO nice?! Fully expecting to pay, they insisted they take care of it. I will continually shop at Rothy\u2019s not only because of their quality shoes but kind and helpful service. So so beyond wonderful! Really great shoes terrrrrible customer service. Rothy\u2019s really made me feel like all they care about is making a buck. I ordered shoes and paid for faster shipping so I\u2019d have them in time for family pictures. The tracking showed they would be late so I called and was told sorry we can refund the shipping if they end up being late. I explained that doesn\u2019t resolve the issue and asked for shoes to be sent again with faster shipping but was just told thanks for your understanding and sorry. Come to find out by calling the local store (45 minutes away) they have them so technically they could be sent overnight in time. The store couldn\u2019t even hold them for an extra day until I could get there. Super disappointing. The ladies there were AMAZING!!! Super sweet and incredibly insightful!!! They took their time with me and helped me try on every single style and more than one size of each of those! They\u2019re all very nice and cheerful. Also, THE SHOES!!! They\u2019re so COMFORTABLE!!! These are BY FAR THE MOST COMFORTABLE FLATS IVE EVER COME ACROSS!!! I am now a forever buyer and will continue to buy more. Please do yourself a favor and give into a little self-care and invest in one of these bad boys! A black flat will go far!!!! And again, so comfortable!!! Went back to ask about a return. Manager had the most crazy attitude for absolutely no reason. Accused me of fraud because I had asked a question about what qualified for a return. Mind you I purchased $3k+ from the nyc store. Never going back.\n\nTall dude is cool though. He was very direct but it made sense. As soon as I walked in, the staff was welcoming and helpful. My girlfriend was looking for new heels, and with the staff\u2019s assistance, she found exactly what she wanted. I hadn\u2019t planned on buying anything, but I ended up picking up a few items too. I even hit it off with one of the staff members who\u2019s also into cars like me. I definitely recommend this place\u2014especially with a second floor opening up soon! Loved my experience at this location last weekend! They have a really great selection of clothing, with a good amount of trendy pieces, and some great classic Diesel pieces too.  The staff were awesome - super friendly and helpful. I was looking for a new pair of jeans and they took the time to find the perfect fit for me.  Definitely recommend checking them out if you're in Boston and looking for some edgy, trendy, and quality clothes! Staff is always nice and helpful whenever I visit, great vibe also! I live in Dallas but was visiting in Boston. I was greeted by Alexis and she helped me purchase items for my niece. She was so helpful, knowledgeable and friendly that I will return and ask for her. Clearly the BEST sunglass purchasing experience of my life. Sunglass Hut on Newbury Street. Smart, kind, honest, patient salesperson - who just MADE MY DAY - and helped me to make the right purchase for me. I would 100% recommend -poster child for creating a FABULOUS sunglass retail experience. A++++++++++++ Drew is a god send please go to him for your needs!! He made me feel very welcome and was very patient with my questions. Great variety of styles, brands, and price points. The friendly associates don\u2019t push a sale and are helpful with promotions you can take advantage of, explaining the one-year breakage warranty, and spend time ensuring a good fit. Bonus - a customer in a wheelchair came in while I was shopping, and had plenty of room to look around \u2026 meaning they\u2019d made the effort to make a Newbury St store accessible. Solid experience. Great customer service, very friendly and helpful with repairing my sunglasses Christian and team were extremely helpful, courteous, and not pushy. Highly recommended for both new glasses or repairs (I needed screw replacement on a pair of Persol sunglasses). If you\u2019re looking for a barbershop that truly delivers exceptional service, Anfa Barbershop should be at the top of your list. Owned and operated by Abdou, a barber whose expertise and attention to detail are unmatched, this place offers more than just a haircut\u2014it\u2019s a personalized grooming experience.\n\nAnfa Barbershop offers a range of services beyond haircuts, including beard trimming, hot towel shaves, and beard coloring ,  all designed to leave you feeling refreshed and confident.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten my haircut from him for about a year and Abdou has a natural way of making you feel like more than just a customer. His conversations are intriguing and most importantly his precision with both clippers and shears are incredible and he takes time to understand your preferences and makes thoughtful recommendations that suit your look.\n\nWhat really sets Abdou apart is his mastery of the craft. His skills with clippers are flawless, delivering fades and tapers with clean, seamless transitions that make every haircut look sharp and polished. His work with shears is just as impressive too\u2014whether it\u2019s adding texture or creating a more classic, refined style, you can tell he has a deep understanding of the techniques.\n\nConveniently located in Back Bay and with an easy online booking system, Anfa Barbershop makes grooming an enjoyable and stress-free experience. Abdou has created something special here\u2014a place where every visit feels like catching up with an old friend while leaving with a look you\u2019re proud of. Whether you\u2019re in need of a quick touch-up or a full grooming session, you won\u2019t be disappointed. I am sure this barbershop is awesome. It\u2019s just not for me. I\u2019m making my review so you know what to expect. Expect the lowest price men\u2019s haircut to be $80. That is fine, and probably fair in this town. But I was very courteous, and told the proprietor that I thought it was not for me but thank you. Then he proceeded to be insulting and degrading. I did not get my haircut here. Abdou is the best! He gives an awesome haircut and I've been coming here for almost 10 Years. You will not be disappointed, he's a very talented barber. I actually think he writes his own code for his website...he's a genius! Phenomenal experience! Excellent and precise haircut with careful service. Staff was very friendly. I will surely be back :) Highly recommend! If I could give this place 7 stars I would! I found this place a year ago while looking for a new barber in Boston, I can honestly say that I am happy I did,  because he now has a customer for life. Abdo is one of the most down to earth people that I\u2019ve ever met, the place is always clean and his haircut are HANDS DOWN the best I\u2019ve had. He\u2019s has always been very flexible when trying to find time in my and his busy schedule to fit me in. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to anyone who appreciates attention to detail and great customer service!! I don\u2019t get it. The product quality is distinctly average to slightly above average for athletic wear. What\u2019s worse is inconsistent sizing across products that is not possible to comprehend until you try it on. This is amplified by really poor customer service that is punctuated with the type of attitude that you would more commonly find in a designer boutique. My husband and I have been coming here almost every year after he finishes the Boston Marathon. We love visiting this place after the race because hosting the Boston Marathon finishers here is a remarkable tribute to the community. Offering refreshments and recording the runners\u2019 final times on posters shows a generous spirit. I visited Boston recently and was excited to visit the store, but was quite underwhelmed. There was a very small selection of clothing in store, we couldn\u2019t find anyone that worked there and another guest had to tell us where the fitting room was. No one asked to help us the entire time we were in the store. So it was kind of a weird experience. Clothing is always nice and feels quality. We  visited the store on Friday august 25th in the afternoon. My husband and I were looking for running shoes. We walked in not knowing what to expect or anything about the store. The guy running the store would only speak to my husband and was only offering him shoes to try on. He completely disregarded me. I eventually asked to try a pair of shoes and his shock could not have been more obvious.\n\nIt was clear he took one look at me and decided I wasn\u2019t a runner type based on how I looked. He seemed to be very surprised to hear that I had run multiple races before. If you want to make a sale I would recommend treating your clientele better, especially when you don\u2019t know anything about them. Body shaming/judging isn\u2019t going to get you a loyal customer. I was a fan of Tracksmith but feel like they are losing sight of what made them fun and approachable\u2014the amateur runner ethos. On a recent trip to Boston, I was excited to finally visit the store and maybe be reinvigorated by the vibe and aura of the track house. Unfortunately, it was the opposite experience for me, with an unfriendly and unwelcoming staff and just an overall disappointing visit. Love my old gear, but don't think anything new will be ordered anytime soon. Ordered a pair of leggings i was very excited for. They have a cute curation of activewear, and i\u2019m always happy to support new shops, especially women owned. Unfortunately i got hit with $95 in shipping and duties, on top of the $24 shipping i had to pay for and there were no notes indicating there would be any additional high cost fees. I order a lot of activewear from the states and have never dealt with fees like this on top of paying for shipping for premium activewear. The fees ended up being the entire price of the leggings themselves. To top it off i can\u2019t even refuse to accept them because this store doesn\u2019t allow any returns or exchanges if you live in Canada. Pretty unacceptable, and disappointing. I love supporting this upscale, female owned company and boutique. They are very conscientious about their customers' retail experience. I have bought many different items at the Boston location. The quality and variety of fitness fashion is the best in New England! I have also had a very positive experience ordering from their website as well. I enjoy a fairly active lifestyle both in and outside of my athletic club.  I love fashion and became quite addicted to the very fashion forward and upscale activewear from Fitness Hub Boutiques.\n\nI have shopped at all three of their locations in Massachusetts (Newbury Street, Assembly Row and Chestnut Hill). In addition to the beautiful activewear that I purchase to work out in at my athletic club, I also purchase activewear outfits for travel and for dining out in upscale restaurants in the US as well as in Europe.\n\nI love the very personalized attention that I receive from the Fitness Hub staff no matter which location I happen to be in.  Even when I order their activewear on line, I always enjoy reading the personalized hand-written note from the Fitness Hub staff.\n\nI enjoy the compliments I receive from women in my exercise classes and naturally I am always happy to recommend that they pamper themselves with a shopping trip to any Fitness Hub Boutique. They will certainly be treated quite well by the staff and definitely will enjoy their Fitness Hub shopping experience.\n\nPatricia A\nWeston, MA Obsessed with this store!  The service is amazing and they have so many brands I love. The inventory of ALO they had was amazing!!! And they had a lot of other brands that I love to shop with. The Curation in this store made an avid active wear lover like myself super happy! Staff was friendly and very helpful. Definitely coming back. Best store for the best options of active wear in Boston. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f This location seems a bit overwhelming and the service is diluted. There's never enough staff! Google what you buy first or go next door to bloomies, often times they sell old seasons at full price. I used to like going to this location because there are a lot of options but if you want a more tailored and special experience and/or specially made orders legit across the street is fab and even has footwear! They are awesome. Great service. Their app is awesome with the \u201con my way\u201d feature so I can double park real quick and run in and grab your stuff. We live in Charlestown but because I can drop clothes off 24 hours and with the easy pick up - it\u2019s a no brainer. Poor customer service. Even poorer communications. I sent a pair of leather pants for cleaning, expecting the special handling meant longer than the standard twice-a-week delivery turnaround. They said \"2 to 3 weeks.\" They've had my pants for over 5-6 weeks! They never called me. Twice, I've called them. Most recently, they said my pants were back from the outside vendor and would be delivered ...um, yesterday. No delivery. No explanation. This is horrible service. No follow-up. No one calls me. I have to contact them. To make matters worse, Dependable is charging me $184!!! I've been their customer for 20+ years but will be re-thinking dry cleaning services. I have to make a special trip into Boston to go to Dependable Cleaners on Newbury Street, but it is worth it.  I buy good clothes and I trust that they will turn my order around quickly and do an excellent job. I dropped off my white sweater off with a small light brown stain and when I received it back, there was a larger brown stain on it that was in a circle as if someone had put a pot of coffee on my sweater. Now I have two stains on my sweater although luckily the original had faded a bit after they treated it, but the new stain is worse than the old stain. About six years ago, this place ruined most of my business shirts, and I'm still finding damaged shirts in my wardrobe. They used some type of chemical on collars that discolored the fabric. It was extremely evident on white shirts. I think they reimbursed me for one shirt, and that was it. I just pulled a sky blue shirt from my closet, as I was thinking of wearing it to my wedding reception. The collar is discolored, and there's a scratch on the lapel. The last place I took it was Dependable. What an absolutely fantastic store to buy leather goods from.\n\nThe store smells completely of leather and how it would smell like in a forest after raining.\n\nThe staff is polite and helpful.\n\nGreat collection of jackets and jewellery which feel premium at a decent price.\n\nShop is best for boots, belts and jackets. Other leather goods are available on demand. There is street parking available. No wheelchair access.\n\nIf you\u2019re just on a stroll in Newbury Street, so visit this store!! Was just recently in this shop on a trip to Boston looking for some western clothing. Ended up buying a great quality lee denim jacket at a great price (roughly a quarter of what you could pay for one) thanks to the help of the owner who has extremely hospitable and great to chat to. Well, if you happen to be looking for a place for used boots and leather jackets to let out your inner Steve McQueen or delevop your Marlboro Man persona, this is your place.  And you can even do it in relative private, because I do not think the person sitting behind the counter in front noticed us walk in, or even noticed when we walked out! Some cool memorabilia and leather goods but the owner was pretty rude.\n\nWhile purchasing a belt, I asked about the backstory of a keychain they had for sale. He condescendingly told me \u201cit\u2019s a keychain\u201d and continued to be standoffish as I tried to make conversation.\n\nI was trying to buy your keychain dude! Literally any ounce of friendliness gets you that sale. Amazing store, the owner Rick and his wife are great people! Some really great stuff here especially considering you\u2019re in Boston! They have something for everyone. Old rock concert tees and plenty of country boots, apparel, and accessories. They\u2019ve been in the area well over a decade and I sure hope they don\u2019t go anywhere! They also have an AWESOME selection of both classic rock and country records. I found a few albums that I am so excited to throw for a spin. It\u2019s hard for me to believe I found classic country music records eye in Boston, MA! The store sits in a very beautiful area and is absolutely worth the drive or walk to get there! It\u2019s added to my list of places that are MUST stops when I come back through Boston.. For locals they have a rotating inventory too so stopping in every few weeks is definitely not a bad idea, I know I would if I lived anywhere near Boston!\n\nAs for the reviews saying the management was rude, I found it to the complete opposite. Both Rick and his wife were very helpful and eager to answer any questions I asked about the store and even the local area. They\u2019re great people with a fantastic store! We really enjoyed our time at our Hatch property, The unit was well equipped with everything we needed and was very clean and quiet.  The location is absolutely perfect for anything you want to do in downtown Boston. We were even able to catch a free Logan Express bus from the airport that dropped us off a couple blocks from the property, no need to rent a car.  Communication with the Hatch staff was great easy check in and check out.  We would definitely stay at another one of their properties. Amazing location on Newbury St in Back Bay! We traveled as a family of four, including a 4 and 7 year old and everyone fell in love with both Boston and this unit. I loved the quaintness of the location but also close to the T. Tons of shops/restaurants just steps away. Excellent service from Thatch. We needed an extra blanket for my daughter and the off-site staff was very responsive to my texts. The pullout couch was saggy on one side, would not be ideal for two adults, but then again what pullout couch is. Note that there is no elevator, for anyone with mobility issues. We all loved eating our breakfast and people watching out the bay window as the city slowly came alive each morning. I will definitely be recommending this unit to any friends visiting Boston. There is nothing negative about the place. Very nice, very clean and easy to access.\nThe area is exactly were you want to stay.\nShort walking distance to many attractions.\n\nJust mind that there are not elevators.\n\nI recommend this place Beautiful with one bedroom with pull out couch, perfect for our family of four. Apartment is as pictured- stylish, very clean and well-equipped. In the middle of EVERYTHING, location could not be better. Very easy and hospitable communication with the management - answered all our questions within seconds. We will definitely be back next time in Boston! Great location, walking distance to everything we wanted to see and do this trip. The apartment was clean and stocked with the essentials. There is no lift here so be mindful on what you pack. During our stay the laundry from the building was being collected and unfortunately was stored in bags at the bottom of the stairs. This made it a tripping hazard and also difficult when carrying luggage down the last flight of stairs. Overall, great place and we all said we'd happily stay there again! Pressed Juicery is one of my favorite spots for a quick and healthy pick-me-up. Their cold-pressed juices are always fresh and flavorful\u2014Greens 3 and Citrus 2 are my top picks. The staff is friendly, the stores are clean and modern, and while the prices are a bit on the higher side, the quality and convenience make it worth it. Whether you\u2019re doing a cleanse or just looking for a nutritious treat, Pressed Juicery delivers every time. If I could give this 0 stars I would. Stopped in on a beautiful Saturday afternoon in March hoping for a refreshing cup of Vanilla Freeze only to be snapped at for asking for it. The employee was extremely condescending and killed our whole vibe. In the future, I hope Pressed considers freezing their most advertised flavor on a busy Saturday. Multiple other parties left when they realized it wasn\u2019t available. The first time I went to this place, I had an amazing Acai and my husband tried to get a smores ice cream. First answer: we don\u2019t have ice cream. (Even with that I gave them a 5star review because the Acai was very nice)\n\nSecond time we went: I got another Acai and my husband tried to get an ice cream. The answer: no ice cream.\n\nThird time we tried to have the ice creams because they look really refreshing and flavorful, but as always: no ice cream.\n\nWe went yesterday to get an Acai and try to get an ice cream. The answer: no ice cream and NO ACAI. We tried to order different option and they o my had tropical and juices.\n\nMy main issue is not only that they should remove all this options from the menu since we have gone +3 times and we have NEVER been able to try them, but also because there was a 10 minute (because yes, it is also very slow) to tell us that they only had tropical flavor. Stop making your clients loose their time. I never write reviews on places but genuinely every time I have been here in the past year has been a horrible experience. Always the same one girl working. She\u2019s mean, closes up shop an hour before the store actually closes. I ordered a peppermint freeze one time and it came melted, and only half of the cup was filled. Don\u2019t believe any of the pictures outside of the door at this place because the food does not look like the pictures and half the time they aren\u2019t even selling it. These workers are the rudest I\u2019ve ever ever seen. It was unbelievable. Really friendly staff and a beautiful store! I love ice cream so I was skeptical at the idea of \"vegan\" ice cream but it was absolutely delicious (I got the chocolate/vanilla swirl) and I topped it with blueberries, granola, and raspberry drizzle.\n\nThe juices are also great but I really only tried a couple. The Greens 3 was very drinkable and I definitely felt good afterward.\n\nThe only thing I didn't love is that their membership was confusing. They seemed to tell me that there were no fees but that's only if you spend $10/month (which go towards items you buy there). Lady M Boston is hands down my go-to for the best cake in the city. I\u2019ve visited multiple times, and the quality is always incredible. Especially their Mille Cr\u00eapes cakes, which are light, flavorful, and totally addictive. When I can\u2019t make it in person, I\u2019ll order on DoorDash to satisfy the craving. Whether it\u2019s a special occasion or just a sweet treat, Lady M never disappoints :) Newbury St location is a takeout only, we bought a cake for my daughter\u2019s bd here and we were surprised how smooth it was, we ordered the Crepe Mille style. I\u2019ve never had this kind of cake, wow  the layers melt in your mouth \u2026 we bought the strawberry matcha and the crepes are made to perfection as they\u2019re soft, moist and chewy and packed with a beautiful bag as well as a plastic knife. Amazing cake and experience\u2026 I definitely buy it again!!!!!\nI gave them 4 stars because of the customer service, they didn\u2019t have a friendly attitude. The crepes of this cake restaurant from NY did impress me a lot, and the Signature Mille Crepe, Green Tea Mille Crepe, and Strawberry Mille Crepe I ordered would definitely make me become a loyal customer.\n\n#AmazingCrepesFromNY Such a cute place!! I was walking by and the place caught my eye. The cake and treats looked exquisite. I was a little hesitant after seeing the price but am so glad I ended up getting it!! The employee recommended the pistachio cake and my goodness\u2026 what a treat. It was excellent!! I would highly recommend it, especially for special occasions. The cake had great flavor and texture. Awesome place in the Newbury area. Their cakes are so full of flavors yet so light. The place is always busy but service is very fast - you won\u2019t have to wait for more than 5 minutes. Had the pistachio, tiramisu and the checkers - the first 2 were especially good. I was a bit concerned at first, but the results are really good!\n\nI do think the salon could look a bit more upscale, and the process could feel more professional. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it, but something about it didn\u2019t feel that way\u2014so I just wanted to mention it.\n\nThat being said, the most important thing is that I\u2019m happy with my eyebrows (and I\u2019m picky!).\n\nThank you! This was a great experience!! My brows look beautiful and the staff is so friendly! Highly recommend! Shanti is very good at her work. She does my eyebrows very well. Get it done from her. I\u2019m using a friend\u2019s account to stay anonymous, but I just want to preface this review with the fact that I am South Asian so I have a lot of experience getting my eyebrows done over the years! I went to the Newbury St location since the salon near Boston Univ that I usually go to was closed early. I explicitly told the woman who did my eyebrows today that I wanted to keep my original shape and just needed them to be cleaned up a bit. She completely took out the arched shape of my brows and drastically shortened the tails, making them look short and fat. My eyebrows don\u2019t even look symmetrical anymore. I have never been so unhappy with how my eyebrows look. I will not be returning to this location. Aisya did my thread/tint at the Newbury St location. I was very hesitant because I moved recently and have only ever let one technician do my brows over the last 5 years. I\u2019m so happy I found someone in Boston that I trust!! Thank you Aisya I tried something new and did the cat eye gel manicure. The results were amazing, I love them so much. Joanne does my nails everytime I go\u2014 she is detail oriented and takes her time to make sure your nails come out perfect! I recommend her. Update: I went back to give them another chance and they did a fantastic job. There was much more care that went into it this time around and they were very efficient. Will update on the longevity of the manicure as well! Thank you Town.\n\n---\n\nI really, really wanted to like this place because it is so close. The ladies are so incredibly kind. However, the gel manicure was just not up to par. My nails are all different lengths, the polish was applied unevenly / very chunkily, and there is top coat seeping into my nail bed / edges. Will likely not return very unfortunately. I love the nails that Joanne did for me. They came out exactly how I wanted and she spent time on every detail making sure it was perfect even past closing! I 100% recommend her and I will be a regular. I almost never leave review but I also have never been so disappointed and dissatisfied with my service at any establishment. My pedicure was rushed. Maybe 10 minutes max. No massage, barely any oils or lotions used. My entire pinky toe isn\u2019t even painted! My massage chair didn\u2019t work and I only know because I had to try myself to use it, even though I saw other patrons have their chair turned on for them. Other patrons were offered water, not me. They tried to up charge my pedicure by offering the illegal \u201ccheese grater\u201d and were shocked when I said no. It\u2019s illegal, I have close friends who are licensed nail techs so I am educated on the damage those do to the feet. I saw other patrons have their coats and bags carried to their seat as they got ready for the manicure, I had to carry everything myself. With the manicure, my nails were not cut to be even, just filed unevenly, and over filed at that. She removed way too much of my cuticle, which is damaging and unhealthy, and cut skin on my fingers in the process. The polish was applied without care, I had to peel gel off my skin as I waited for my friend to get her nails finished and noticed that there were spots that weren\u2019t fully painted and the topcoat doesn\u2019t cover the full nail. I\u2019m not sure if we looked like we didn\u2019t belong or couldn\u2019t afford the service, but I went in with the intention of doing an upgraded pedicure and gel extensions. After my poorly done pedicure, I stayed and got a regular gel manicure. I should have left. The service and work were not worth the cost, even though I went there with the intention to spend more. Jenny was very sweet and attentive to me while I got my nails done with her. When I didn\u2019t like the color, she changed it for me without hesitating. She also let me decide my own shape. I changed my mind a lot before we started but she was patient and kind. She made conversation with me which was also very nice. It was my first time doing dip-powder and she made it a great experience. I showed up first thing on Monday morning right before they opened at 9am to drop off two packages. The worker let me in right away, was super friendly and was happy to tape up one of my packages for me. Overall a very quick and easy experience! This is my go to location and they are the best!  Sean (manager) and the other staff are so friendly and efficient.  Highly recommend if you\u2019re needing a UPS store near Newbury St/Copley :) I love this UPS store so much! Sean and his team are so helpful. As someone who gets a lot of packages and has a ton of returns, you can trust me when I say this UPS is superior than the rest!! At UPS at Newbury Street. Staff memeber Sean helped me as soon as I walked in through th door. Was able to use an amazon box I had at home which he was able to use so I did not have to purchase a new box and also taped it up for me. Great service and would come here again! Thank you so much Sean! Super friendly staff, excellent customer service, quick & to the point. The team at this location made the process of shipping an oversized package as easy as it gets. Highly recommend over the other UPS store locations in Boston. You can smell the leather when you walk in the door. What a great store with lots of really nice quality shoes and products. The layout is nice too and it's not to crowded. Staff is pretty helpful and friendly. Great location on Newbury street and you should take a peek inside if you're looking for quality products. Love these boots and bags. Amazing quality and style.\nI've purchased multiple pairs and bags from this storefront and have nothing but great things to say about them.\nThe service is great, they are very helpful and polite. Beautiful store and shoes but terrible customer service. I walked around for 5 minutes and was never helped until I finally asked someone standing around for a boot. She requested them and I had to wait another 5 minutes for them to be brought from the back. I watched her interact with another customer who had at least 5 pairs of boots and never lifted a finger. I had 1 pair and she gave me the boot and walked off then watched as I placed the boots with all the packing back in the box. I told her the issue I had with them and her response was \u201cyeah that happens.\u201d I will get a pair of the boots but definitely not from there! Fantastic boots with higher prices but amazing quality.  I've been so very pleased I spent the extra money for a better boot so many times over the years that Frye gets my full endorsement.  Nice store, helpful staff, just generally great. Worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. No one looks at you (unless you catch them staring when you turn around). I had to stand awkwardly at the register until this snobby girl finally looked up and said \"did you need help\". I'm here to return something I bought online and they're acting like its the most obnoxious thing they've ever been asked to do. $10 return and we're now going on 15 mins and she's still not sure she can do it. Awful. Love this shop and the girls that work there! always so sweet and helpful! The basement is a mess I'm not happy with my first experience selling with this company. I was told that items are priced at retail and if they were sold above $200.  I would get 50%, if under $200, I get 40%  I received a statement listing my  Christian Dior shoes at $500.  They were sold in approx a week and I received $117.50. I called and asked for an explanation and was told the price was lowered and I should have received an email. To my knowledge an email with the lowered price was never sent. The manager said it was human error that I never got a statement with the lower price. The shoes were pre-owned, but never worn. I should know the amout item is being sold for before my item is being sold! No transparency! Update from previous review.  I received a call from the owner, who stated she was not aware of the issue I had with my first experience. She was very apologetic and agreed to send me a check right away for the amount based on the original selling price. I appreciate their willingness to make the situation right! Best consignment store we visited while in Boston. The absolute sweetest employees and my bestie bought an insanely gorgeous pair of Dior heels at a great price I've shopped here for years and absolutely adore it! The employees and the atmosphere is unmatched! The consignment process is not good. They could have told me that they would not accept my coat when I'm in the store instead of emailing me after I just left. Sneaker Junkies is a must-visit! The customer service is top-notch--friendly and knowledgeable staff always ready to help from the owner to the cashier. They offer a fantastic selection of shoes, especially kicks you won't find in many other shops. Plus, their deals are consistently great, making it easy to walk away with a stylish pair without breaking the bank. Been going to these guys for over 10 years now from their PVD to Boston Locations and will continue to buy shoes from them for years to come. Support your local sneaker shops and especially this great small business. Highly recommended! Great store with its own brand, they have nice shoes usually. Awesome little boutique with some bad ass sneakers. They didn't have my size in these snake-skin-looking Adidas, but they fit my sister... Great sale we went in! And the guys that run the shop are really cool and funny. \ud83d\udc9b Best of luck to your business, guys! Showed up 10 minutes before opening, wasn\u2019t open (we figured). Walked around for 45-60 minutes to kill time. Came back to the store, and they still were not open. If you have hours listed on your google maps page\u2026 maybe make sure it\u2019s actually open at those times Staff is friendly and very conversational. They know what they\u2019re talking about when it comes to shoes and are willing to help find something that works for you. Easily one of the best shoe stores around, plus some really cool clothing. Prices are on the high end of average, but normal for the brands. The team at European Watch Company (Robert, Michael, Hal) were all highly responsive and communicative during the entire transaction.  It started with a watch service, and it turned into a trade-in, with an additional trade-in, and then my newly purchased Patek arrived via overnight shipping exactly as described.  Highly recommend! Very responsive service, exceptional inventory, great experience from start to finish.  Worked with Zack for the second time, this time with both trades and a purchase. Could not be more pleased and only wish I had started doing business with EWC sooner! Everything from speaking on the phone to the delivery of my 2025 Rolex Submariner was perfect.\nChris Weiss was outstanding.\nI will be sure to pass the word about EWC to all who are interested in Quality Timepieces.\nThanks,\nMarc, Nyc An excellent transaction with Zack! They had the watch I wanted, an IWC Big Pilot 43, and made the deal easy. Shipped a couple trades, paid a little cash and my IWC is on my wrist. I trust these fine folks in Boston! Picked up an IWC Big Pilot from EWC (via Chrono24.com) and could not be happier. The watch is still under warranty (was originally sold new 10/2023), easily transferred (and subsequently extended until 2031 via IWC passport), full set with original box/papers, etc. Excellent condition, better than the \"very good\" they listed it as.  Excellent price, and cannot wait to use them again. Highly satisfied, highly recommended.  Thank you very much! This was my first time here and I read reviews before coming since I am rather picky with my nails. I wanted a french manicure, which is hard to perfect. I decided to try an appt with Bebe and she is amazing. She spent a lot of time on my cuticles and shaping my nails the way I wanted, and did a perfect gel manicure. We did 3 coats put it in neutral and a thin french tip. She was meticulous is every step and tried a few base colors to confirm it was what I wanted. She checked in with me after each step to confirm I was happy. It is definitely on the expensive side for nail salons in the area, but I believe it\u2019s worth it for the quality. Booking online was super easy as well. Glad I found her and will be coming back in the future :). This was my first time here, and I wanted a specific design for my gel manicure (cat eye nail polish). Min did an excellent job and was able to replicate the look based on a photo I showed him. He is extremely detail-oriented, and I would highly recommend him to anyone. One of the best nails salons in Boston! This is a beautiful, relaxing space in a great location! My stylist Chloe and the rest of the staff were so friendly and accommodating! I also got exactly what I asked for in terms of nail design and feel really pleased. I strongly recommend coming here to get your nails done! I\u2019ve been coming to this nail salon for years, and I can honestly say it's the best in Boston! The staff is always so sweet and welcoming, and the salon is clean. Min is absolutely amazing, and I always ask for him when I visit. He does the most perfect nails every time and is the sweetest! I always leave feeling happy and in love with my nails. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for top-notch service and quality! This was probably the best manicure I\u2019ve ever had. Min was very detail oriented and took his time. My nails came out perfectly and I love the chrome gel effect. I\u2019ve already received so many compliments. Can\u2019t recommend coming here to get your nails done enough! I could have had a great experience here. I came in with dip on my nails and was asked if I wanted dip or gel. I said dip but the guy decided to do gel. When he did the shape of my nails did not ask if it was okay just started painting. When he did the base layer of nail polish he did not ask if it was okay just started painting the tips. Clearly the base was not enough if I can see my natural nail under the polish. He did ask me if I wanted the tip small or large to which I said medium. When he did the tip I asked him for more polish to which he rudely replied \u201cyou said small and now you want more\u201d and I replied no I said medium. He clearly didn\u2019t care about providing a good service but made sure to ask if his tip would be on the credit card. I\u2019m a tipped employee and understand it\u2019s hard not receiving a tip for your service but also understand you should be giving a service the client is happy with. The main concern of this man seemed to be getting me out of his chair as quick as possible. They so nice! I came with no appointment and didn\u2019t have to wait! Mia did an amazing job!! I got powder (SNS) on my nails! Thank you Mia :) The most top notch and luxury nail salon in the Back Bay. The customer service is of the highest quality and everyone here is so nice and professional. I HIGHLY recommend Mike, he shapes my nails to perfection and really takes his time - truly shows how much he values his craft. The salon is very clean and the owner truly cares about customers and ensures their comfort throughout the entire service. I\u2019ve been to various nail salons in the Boston area, but none of them meet the high standards set here. I felt very relaxed and stress free throughout my service. Thank you Jennifer\u2019s Nail & Skin Salon. Went to Jennifer\u2019s for my nails, they look stunning and the salon was INCREDIBLY clean. The entire time I was there, every one was cleaning the place top to bottom. Extremely friendly service from everyone at Jennifer\u2019s, Jennifer herself was incredibly sweet and helpful, too. Highly recommend! My nails are so weak after getting gel nails from here - they drill so hard and fast that your nails will be so thin and brittle. Also not nice customer service here and doesn\u2019t know how to do simple/complex art. I love here!!!  My favorite florist store in Boston. The staff is cute and lovely. I often buy bouquets here. Their bouquet styles are pretty unique and the flowers are so fresh. They will never let me down. The drinks in this store also are amazing! Highly recommend\uff01 Super cute and unexpected cafe. This was my first time here and I was very happy with the drinks. I highly recommend the strawberry fresh milk. With less than an hour to closing there weren\u2019t many desserts left but the blue heart was a mango mousse with a thin blue chocolate crust. The cat paw is a cheesecake. It has a different texture and taste from American cheesecake. The decor inside is beautiful and insta worthy I wonder for those people who rated 1 star here, have you ever bought flowers there??\n\nI\u2019ve been going there to buy bouquets or take flower arranging classes for almost a year now. The place is super cute and chic. All the staffs there are warm and nice and are trying their best to meet my requirement for my bouquets (size and color). Some of their flowers are really unique and always met (or even beyond) my expection. I loooooved my drink. It was such a simple strawberry milk drink but they made it so good somehow. The decor and aesthetic of this place is gorgeous. I don't usually come to Newbury Street, but I think I will come back just to try other things on their menu. I just wanted to highlight how pretty this bouquet is. Just YIKES! Amazing! Also, the service is really down to earth and I was able to learn a little bit about how to take care of the flowers after I take them back home. Would definitely revisit again! I had such a great experience at Balance Studio that I had to leave a review. I booked a massage with Eva and wow she\u2019s incredible. I came in with tight shoulders and lower back tension, and she worked through every knot with the perfect amount of pressure. You can tell she\u2019s experienced and really cares about making sure you feel better when you leave.\n\nThe studio itself is super clean and peaceful. It\u2019s tucked away on Newbury Street, so it\u2019s easy to get to but still feels like a hidden gem. The atmosphere is calm, the staff is friendly, and everything felt very professional yet relaxing.\n\nHighly recommend this spot if you\u2019re in Boston and need to recharge. Definitely ask for Eva\u2014she\u2019s the real deal. I\u2019ll 100% be back soon! I came in to get  shoulder massage based on their signage  specializing in shoulder massages at $1 per minute - upon entering I was offered a table massage at $50 for 30 min - after some back and forth they offered me 15 min for $20 \u201ca dollar a minute\u201d and ensured to advise me before hand it didn\u2019t include tip. I was then seated on a  step stool and a gentleman came to do my massage - a lot of the massage was him leaning into my shoulder with his elbow with his stomach pressing into my back. He also massaged/ pinched my neck area a bit and I could feel his nails from time to time. Do not recommend Absolutely amazing job. Very professional and all my requests were met. My body feels amazing! When you get an hour massage you should be tipping at least $15. I've read some of the reviews on here and I didn't have any issues with tipping. I thought the massage was worth $100 so I tipped $30. They started out lighter and warmed up to deeper work. My whole body feels absolutely amazing. They used hot stones on my back and were very cautious and mindful about the heat from the stones. I would definitely recommend and just communicate what you are liking and not liking because they will adjust accordingly. Thank you ladies for the wonderful experience! AMAZING MASSAGE !! The 60min deep tissue massage was so incredible! This massage really worked out the knots and tension in my muscles, it went over my whole body (back, arms, hands, head, legs/ feet), and the hot stones were such a great touch. I recommend this place to everyone, will definitely be coming back. Small and comfy. Leave all thoughts at the door and simply enjoy your time there. The therapists have great strength, perfect for those who want a medium deep tissue massage, perfect for big or muscular men. Some of the ladies there speak broken english, but they will make it work for you. The prices are very reasonable. I love a good stationary store.  This one did not disappoint.  Plenty of products for personal use or gift giving.  Got a few things for a niece that loves to write.\n\nThe staff person was super friendly and helpful.  Was able to show me a extremely nice, and extremely expensive collection of pens.  Which impressed me but didn't fit my needs. What a really cool store. Filled with all sorts of things you didn't think you needed but now you really want.\n\nThe staff is absolutely amazing and exceedingly helpful. I want to shout out to Madeline R. Her really excellent customer service.\n\nShe took time with me and talk to me about the products and help me find exactly what was right for me.\n\nI ended up buying a pen and some really nice slippers that make me feel like Scottish royalty.\n\nI encourage you to go in and take a look around there's a lot of really fun and usefully things inside. We love this place. We live in Maine but visit Boston regularly, and we try to get to Topdrawer every time. I bought one of their beautiful blue Polaroid 600s, and I love it. The staff are always so helpful. Excellent, passionate and knowledgeable staff, a neatly laid out store for pens, journals, Japanese handkerchiefs and thermoses, and a large supply of sacoches.  It\u2019s right on Newbury Street and hard to pass up if you like analog notebooks and supplies. Joe was super helpful with a last minute stationary project. The store is lovely and the staff could not be more pleasant to work with. Highly recommend! Jordan hemmed a pair of my new dress pants about 6 weeks ago.  I chose him because I live close and he seemed to have good reviews.  I do not remember what he initially charged me for the work, but I remember thinking it was high (maybe ~$30) to hem one pair of pants and it was going to take 10 days.\nThe hem fell out on my third use of the pants.  I only wear them to work as an airline pilot.  I took the pants back to him and he accused me of having caused the problem myself, from my shoes or some other \"activity\" I do while wearing the pants.  I wear several other pairs of pants to work, with the same shoes and none of those hems have failed.  He begrudgingly agreed to fix the hem for free but said if it happened again he would charge me!  Ha! I will not be bringing any more work to him.  He still said the fix will take another 10 days!  After telling this story to my wife this evening, I'm learning that she used him once to hem a skirt and also felt that he was rude to her in their interaction. I cannot recommend Jordan more highly. I went in to have a suit altered and he went above and beyond to ensure quality and timeliness. As he was taking measurements, he presented me with all of his suggestions and their subsequent prices. I in no way felt pressured and he talked me through each option. I selected the ones I felt were important and were within my budget. His prices are very reasonable and the quality is excellent. Throughout the whole process he was friendly and professional and I walked away with a great looking suit and a good feeling. I will definitely be back I need to altered my bikini bottom 1 week before my NPC competition. Someone referred me to Jordan tailor. Mr. Jordan altered my suit very fast. My bottom suit is covered with rhinestones but he did it with no problem! Price also affordable. Got my bottom suit in a week and I won 3rd place! Thank you Mr. Jordan, you have saved my life! Amazing work done patching up a tear in my Canada Goose Jacket. Other places refused to do it or charged a ton, but Jordan the Tailor did it for a great price and under 30 minutes.\n\nThe man working there (I'm assuming Jordan :) ) was so sweet and helpful, and did beautiful work.\n\nI've told my friends to go to him for all their tailoring needs! Great job & great experience, really kind guy :) Jordan is extremely talented! I had a terrible rip on my suit pants and he was able to fix it quickly and nicely. I absolutely recommend him to anybody that needs his assistance. i come to this shop pretty much for most of my eyebrows threading. and i decided to come today to the newbury location to get my brows tinted and threaded. the person who did my brows were nice but i was very disappointed with my experience and service. the tinting was absolutely horrible, it was not what i asked for at all. i asked for natural, and just wanted my eyebrows hair to be tinted, not shaped but they completely gave me the wrong color tint and gave me blocky eyebrows. it looked horrible, especially since the tint isn\u2019t even close to the color of my normal brows, they were so thick and blocky. they tinted way outside of my normal brows making it look like a stamp instead. it was not natural at all. they also thinned out my brows shape when i was just looking for a clean up during the threading. its no where near even. i was really disappointed because this is usually my go to shop for threading services. i ended up having the tint removed because i literally wanted to cry when i asked them to fix it but they insisted that it was the right color and everything and i didn\u2019t even receive a refund even though the result was not what i wanted after repeating it multiple times. i tipped anyways because i felt bad but it was just really bad experience and i left super disappointed It was difficult to communicate with the Technician on Newbury St.,  her English being so bad. I would grade the job as a C. Very disappointed. I was there October 10 around 11:30. I will try another Salon next time. In fact, I have to go to another Salon this weekend to have it done correctly. The threading place just lost a customer for good! DO NOT go here. Mandhira just ruined my eyebrows. She was more interested in speed than checking her work. One is uneven. I\u2019m pissed. Great and natural eyebrows. I asked the employee to make changes many times and still made them. At the end, I left really disappointed but I was simply not use to that extremely natural shape. Now that I\u2019m comfortable with it, I can\u2019t wait to go back there! It was a really quick threading experience! It only took around 10-15 minutes max and my eyebrows came out clean and nicely shaped. They accept walk ins too but it\u2019s easier to just book an appointment on the website. very overpriced, but they have the basics, and I mean BASICs... dont expect the newest salt pod kits here like the NOVO GT Worse exchange/ return policy which they don\u2019t have written and expect all their workers to say by word of mouth.  Wouldn\u2019t take a pen which was bought a day ago though it didn\u2019t work at all. I tipped also. We should be able to get refunded our tip if anything. The dispensary has  better service on products that do not work. For being a chain as the employee stated it\u2019s annoying. Bought at closing and expected to try the product immediately out the door and run back in if it doesn\u2019t work. The policy is awful I've been buying from this store for over a year now, and I never had a problem, so the quality is great. The reason I'm giving 1 star is that it's my first problem and it wasn't fixed. The vape has been cutting the flow since the day I bought (Thursday night). I came this afternoon (Saturday), and the cashier didn't want to replace it. If I can't count with a store when I have a problem, I can't keep doing business with it. Sometimes, being flexible with the policy is better than losing a loyal customer, in my opinion. My experience there was amazing when Scott Rand was there very knowledgeable guy friendly and was easy to talk to, made everyone feel welcomed, I was very very upset when I found out he had left for Downtown the reason being the service and the quality basically died once he had left and I have refused to enter the shop, and I work at 279 Newbury Street. I have gone out of my way drove to where he works now just to have his service, what does that tell you about him as a person the best and there is none better. Shoutout Nidhi, she\u2019s great This was such a pleasant experience!! I'm visiting Boston, and after a couple of long days of walking, I knew I needed a pedicure. Google led me to another nail salon, but they were rude. The receptionist kept trying to ignore me, and another worker had to come and ask me what I needed before she booked my appointment for the next day.  It honestly left such a bad taste in my mouth. Later that day, I saw this place and decided to see if I could do a walk-in.  They were very inviting although it was a late Saturday evening and I was able to get into a chair immediately. I believe my techs name was Mia  but she was meticulous, gentle, and very sanitary.  I'm a trained nail tech and was impressed with how well she performed the service, and she was very nice.  The atmosphere at the salon was also very chill and upscale, although there weren't excessive frills that shouldn't be expected at the price point. I paid $60 for my gel pedicure.  Of note, too, there was a client that finished before me, and the tech that completed her nails immediately began sanitizing and disinfecting the tools he used, a really good sign. All in all would definitely recommend. Ps not too much on my toes lol they've been through a lot I\u2019ve been getting my nails done for 25 years - in multiple countries & all over the US - I can say, without a doubt, that Hao is not only the best, but my favorite nail aesthetician I\u2019ve ever met. His talent and professionalism are unmatched. He goes above and beyond for his clients - staying late and arriving early in order to handle last minute requests. He has been there for some of the best moments of my life (wedding anniversary / vow renewal) and some of the worst (my Dad's passing). He has been there to brighten my day and show me beauty even when I have a hard time finding it. I\u2019m lucky to call him a friend.\n\nHe is talented beyond belief and has challenged me to go beyond my comfort zone. I have had the most beautiful nails since I met him, which has helped me feel even more confident. I can bring in a photo idea and he can recreate it. Or I can tell him to create something special for me, and he does it.\n\nIn short, Hao is a master - an amazing person you would be lucky to have in your life. I was a walk-in and needed two nails replaced as they had fallen off.  Lauren and her staff took charge and the new nails matched perfectly.  I was so imressed i ran back and grabbed my daugher who is 10 and has always wanted to get french.  They were able to do that and then some!  While I waited, I ended up getting an awesome pedicure.  We both left the salon super satisfied and will come back agin, no dount.  I highly recommend Lauren's Nail Salon. Hao did an AMAZING job with my builder nail gel polish!!! And the prices are amazing. So reasonable for builder plus tips on two nails. I will be back! FYI if anyone is looking for builder nail polish he\u2019s the only one that does it so book with him! I had such a great pedicure! My manicurist was very gentle and respectful, and I could tell she was skillful. Thank you! Overpriced, rude and racist cashier, nuff said, avoid at all cost Lots of great chocolate and drinks and other snacks! Best place to find all kinds of snack options. Melted popsicle. Customer service was bad So many gluten free options The fact that I can\u2019t access the ATM after hours is an eye opener that I need to take my money out and close this account . Not being able to access my money just because the card reader on the door has been broke for months is crazy . This is not the first complaint either . If they don\u2019t care enough to do something about the door surly my money isn\u2019t safe and shall other problems arise there is going to be a problem trying to resolve them . Not to mention , when I called customer service to file a complaint I was asked \u201c what would you like me to do about it ?  \u201c . I\u2019m appalled but that\u2019s ok \u201cwhen business isn\u2019t  right , just find somewhere else to do business \u201c.\n\nUpdate: As of 9/12/24 @ 9:05am I\u2019ve been told that the doors are locked and card reader doesn\u2019t work after hours because and I quote \u201cthey don\u2019t want the homeless sleeping and leaving there needles in there\u201d . Definitely do not bank with them because Boston has an influx of homeless and heroine addicts . The fact that you can\u2019t access your money because of it is a piss Poor way to do business. PNC do better Could not access the ATM again on a Sunday because the card reader (that is supposed to allow you to access the ATM 24/7) is broken. Seeing other reviews dating back a year that were saying the same thing. Pretty surprising PNC has allowed a simple problem like this to continue for such a long time. Major inconvenience for Boston customers and motivates me to look for a bank that doesn't let BS continue like this. I went to the bank today and received assistance from Shawn Lawson. My experience was truly exceptional. His service was swift and highly professional, marked by human interaction and great energy. Unlike previous visits with other assistants, I felt respected throughout the appointment instead of feeling like I was under investigation or unwelcome. My husband and I went in to open a savings account. After a short wait of under 15min, we were able to talk to Julio, a member of their team, who was extremely helpful. All our questions were answered, and we were able to open the account on the spot. The staff was nice and knowledgeable. The whole visit was productive, we got what we came for, all in 45min. Very nice service! Excellent customer service! Great account features. The service was excellent, and the delivery was extremely fast compared to other printing companies. I had an urgent request to print a Valentine\u2019s Day card, and they delivered it on the same day within a few hours. I printed my save the dates, wedding invitations and envelopes from here and OMG the staff is so cooperative and so creative. The work done here shows extreme professionalism and attention to detail. 100% recommend for any printing job!! I\u2019ve been here three times and it\u2019s always been great. They help you figure out what you want/need and are very kind about it. Prints are high quality and the service is super fast. Highly recommend :-) I printed programs and invitations for my wedding here and had an excellent experience. The customer service is outstanding, the prices are reasonable, and everything is ready in a day or two. And the quality of the paper/printing is very high. Definitely recommend. I had a very last minute formatting + print request and the team did an exceptional job.  They were professional and the work turned out better than I could have imagined.  So grateful for this fantastic business. \u2764\ufe0f Had great experience at this place. Carlos was great with his job , was friendly, listened carefully to what we wanted, and delivered perfectly. His skill was obvious in every detail of the cut. Professional, attentive, and genuinely talented at his craft - we will definitely recommend .\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b i had a horrible experience. she did not listen to my requests at all. i am a college student and i wanted a self care day. i asked for my hair straightened which is not a difficult task. i called in advance to let them know my hair is curly and it will take more time. no issues with this on the phone. the person doing my hair did not let me know that a trim would be added into the price. she completely deceived me and ripped my off. she made it seem like it was just something she\u2019d do really quick. she cut off so much. she did not straighten it enough. she used the excuse that my hair was too damaged which is just not true. it was also very rude of her to say. i\u2019ve gotten my hair straightened many times and they\u2019ve been able to make it look so amazing and sleek (at other super cut locations). i looked like a lion. i asked her to fix it and she convinced me she couldn\u2019t. if she knew in advance that she couldn\u2019t do a decent job i\u2019d rather her tell me in advance and i would\u2019ve gone somewhere else. she also did a horrible job at cutting my hair is so much shorter and it\u2019s so uneven.  i\u2019ve been to many super cuts locations and have never had this issue. ended up being 77 dollars and it was a complete waste. i left in tears. will never be back! I had an amazing experience at this place. Aly did the best job. It was the first time I got my cut done. I booked an online appointment as well as the stylist. She 1st asked me how do I want my haircut to be done, then because my hair were greasy she washed my hair and then she started the cutting process. Also for length and layers she was showing me and asking me if I am OK with the work she is doing. And believe me it was just 32.95 dollars. Cheapest in Back Bay, with best and friendly stylists. I look forward to haircuts because I get to chat with Mia the whole time as she snips away. Solid cuts and a great experience all around. Online booking (same day) is very simple and straightforward as well. I say to those who give high ratings to this place, why are you deceiving us? I went to this salon based on its good rating, but I had a very bad experience. I asked for blonde highlights and showed a picture of the shade I wanted, and my hair was dyed by a completely unprofessional person, and that was very clear to me. This is not the first time I have done these highlights. In the end, my suspicions were correct. My hair was horrible, uneven highlights and different colors in my hair, yellow in one part and reddish orange in another. I almost cried when I saw my hair like this. Why do you hire incompetent people? I also got an uneven haircut, and I paid a considerable amount for all these mistakes. I will definitely never return to this place and I will not advise anyone to go there either. I finally visited Saatva after needing a new bed for 15 plus years, and had a fantastic experience. Michael was the associate who helped me out, and he was awesome. Super friendly, really knew his stuff, and took the time to explain all the different options without making anything feel overwhelming. He actually listened to what I was looking for and helped me find something that felt just right.\nWould definitely recommend coming here! Finn was very helpful, knowledgeable and personable.  She made the whole buying process so easy.  It was great to be able to try out the mattresses.  The firmness level I thought I wanted was not the one I purchased.  Like the warranty, free delivery and take away of old mattress.  Looking forward to getting new mattress.\nThank you! Finn was really helpful and knowledgeable in guiding us through our options. We came in with an idea of what we wanted but trying things out really made a difference and we went with something different than we originally had in mind. The showroom is aesthetically pleasing and relaxing and the way they facilitated the try-out experience was sanitary and accessible. Really looking forward to receiving our new mattress! Went in just to try the mattress based on reviews. Ended up buying one. Loved the sales rep, Adena. Mentioned other mattresses I\u2019ve tried, and ones I still wanted to try.  She was knowledgeable, and never put down other mattress companies. She wasn\u2019t pushy. I left another store because the sales rep was way too pushy. Love the fact they take old mattress away for free. Not all companies do that. And Saatva got excellent customer service reviews. Can\u2019t wait to get the new mattress! Can't say enough about my experience here. The store Itself is so peaceful and calming. Each one of the staff members were great but Mike worked with me and he was fantastic all the way to the finish. I had come in early without my wife and he helped me find some options that might work for each of us. He was great helping her once she could make it in. The transaction was seamless, no hassle, no pressure just pure happiness. Thank you all again. We will definitely send people your way. Thanks Mike. I had a lovely experience getting a facial here with Lissy. The front desk was warm and welcoming and offered me a drink. Then Lissy took such great care of my sensitive skin. She explained what she was doing and why, and offered advice/answered questions while still maintaining a calm and quiet environment. She\u2019s so kind, knowledgeable and comforting. I left with my skin glowing and feeling so refreshed. Will definitely be back to get a facial with Lissy!! Girlfriend got a facial. The woman doing the facial was fine. The problem was with the woman at the front desk which is presumably the owner (only a crazy owner would have the balls). Girlfriend used a Groupon and she was telling her to pay more than the Groupon! The Groupon was not a gift card but an exchange of service. When she knew my girlfriend was using a Groupon, she started treating her less than. I\u2019m pretty sure she is also racist if you read about the other people having issues with her. Do not go to this place and support this woman\u2019s disrespectful business. Liliya did great job!! It was my first time for getting hair cut in the state, and I absolutely love it!! I started seeing Michelle around 3-4 years ago. I had just moved to the US as a college student. I wasn\u2019t sure who I could trust with my hair so I\u2019d gone about 6 months without a cut. My hair in the meantime had gotten very oily and dry (an awful combination). I had wash my hair basically everyday because it would get oily so quickly. With Michelle\u2019s guidance and scalp balancing regimen, I was able to regain and improve my hair\u2019s/scalp\u2019s health and strength. I am grateful for her expertise and care. I even convinced my mother and then my brother to start seeing her. We are all now her devoted clients! I live in New York now and when I get the chance to visit, I always try to get an appointment with her.\n\nThis past visit, I decided to be adventurous and get a dark red balayage. She did an incredible job with the process and expertly maintained the health and shine of my hair. I thank my lucky stars to have someone like Michelle and Aluna Salon Spa. I highly recommend! I asked for classic balayage with cool tones that should come from the roots. She ruined my hair, it was all yellow with poorly done roots and with a color that was not balanced. Look better at the ends of my hair because I had that kind of color before. Liliya worked on my hair and as an owner she didn\u2019t do anything to improve my experience. She was unprepared and made me feel rushed, because she didn\u2019t know this is gonna take over 3 hours. A week after I came in to fix this, she was so upset and rushing everything, her phone rang at least 15 times and she would stop working on my hair every time it rings. At the end she told me I can dry my hair myself because she has another person coming. The health of my hair is completely destroyed after this! For almost $600 this was the worst experience that I ever had! Not recommending this, save your money!\nP.s. she ruined my max mara shirt! It was my first time visiting an anime store in person and the staff there was really nice and helpful, and there were lots of cool things on display! ^^ I liked the entrance in particular and the inside had a comfy vibe, and I would definitely visit again! Went to this store looking for very specific stuff. Both Lacey and Tre were super helpful. They spent half an hour helping me find exactly what I wanted.\nIt's a great store with pretty impressive collection for anime lovers and of course super amazing staff! Thank you. I enjoy finding practical yet novelty gifts for my nerdy little family, and this store has a budget for everyone! Always exceptional customer service- I was helped by Lacey & Tre, and then checked out by Tati- a group of lovely folks who were all welcoming and knowledgeable about the stores items. Thanks guys! My daughter was on a the hunt for a specific pusheen plush, we came to anime zakka after a google search and it did not disappoint. Vinny ( one of the customer services guys) went above and beyond to search for said pusheen, his customer service was excellent. What  an awesome store, delivering adorable quality goods and amazing customer service. Thank you so much Vinny!! One of the only places I\u2019ve been to that have had the Mofusand hippers in stock! Such friendly and helpful staff. Shout out Tati! She\u2019s super sweet and they all made my day! Megan was personable, welcoming, and more than helpful. 10/10 recommend for customer service !! Stopped in while I was traveling and had a great experience! Cutest section of very versatile and staple pieces. Grabbed a couple pairs of earrings and I love that they don\u2019t break the bank for quality items. Sales associate was simply wonderful. Would definitely shop here again! Jewelry store that serves the younger crowd looking for modern styles of wearable 14k gold and previous and semi precious items. Store is bright, airy and well lit. Staff is super friendly always giving you time to browse and not hovering (like that store that has the light blue boxes and armed security guards following you around). Staff is knowledgeable about their items, what stones, what style, etc. We ended up buying a cute ring with teeny diamonds but super cute and reasonably priced.they even give you a free tote! Best store ever! The store manager, Sam, is so incredibly helpful and knows a lot about jewelry. She made my whole experience so easy and fun. Store is well staffed and stocked, and everyone working there is so nice and helpful. Went in for the first time and received amazing service, above what I expected. I had a broken necklace and they swapped it out no questions asked, which really built trust. I looked around and received very supportive assistance from Crystal. $700 later, I felt comfortable buying from a store that would back up their items no questions asked. Trust is key with jewelry you\u2019re investing in! Thanks! The sweetest owners ever. Felt greatly welcomed as a student. Got many styles of glasses. Always love a southeast Asian business. Bostonian treat!\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf80 Dr T is amazing! I got the most thorough exam with him. Amazing bedside manners too! Hidden gem for sure. One of newbury street\u2019s hidden gems. Its a pleasure to get my eyes tested here, and there is a great selection of frames as well. i\u2019ll definitely be back They are great and professional doctors. The nose paddle of my favorite glasses broke and they helped me find a same pair. Their prescription is better (more exact and ease my eye strain) than those I got from the other optical store. I have been seeing Dr. T and Dr. Ratan here for easily over 10 years, and they are just wonderful!  They run their business with amazing old fashioned care and service.  This place is a hidden gem!\n\nI usually call up to make an appointment only a day or two in advance and they are so accommodating.  My eye exam is super thorough as Dr. T is truly passionate about his work.\n\nThe frames and lenses I have gotten over the years have all been great quality and I recommend the blue light blocking lenses as someone who works on a computer all day.  And all of the insurance billing is taken care of. I have been getting my hair done with Sotiria at Dellaria Salon on Newbury Street in Boston, and she always does such a wonderful job with my blonde! Honestly I have tried several other salons in Boston, and none of them can compare. Highly recommend to see Sotiria at Dellaria!! She is the best in Boston!! I won\u2019t go to anyone else! :) Overall great space! Friendly customer service. Sotiria did an amazing job with the layers. Update: after washing, noticed that I lost half volume of my hair from\u201dtexturizing\u201d essentially thinning most of my hair so it now looks limp and lifeless with breakage from the shredding Love it here! I got a blond balayage with Alice and it was light, bright, and blended and my hair still felt nice and healthy! Very nice location too right on Newbury street, I\u2019ll be back for sure! Truly the best hair salon I've been to. Alice is wonderful, incredibly communicative and understanding, and so very wise and educated!! She was able to determine the ideal hair cut and style for me, and gave tips specifically based on my hair type and needs :) Sortiria is absolutely amazing! I first started coming to her when my hair was a wreck, and she truly transformed it. I have never had a hairdresser make my blonde look so beautiful and natural. After coming to her for almost 4 years, I can say that she is the best around. Also, the salon is impeccably clean and in such a convenient location. All of the staff members treat customers with kindness and care! I cannot recommend Dellaria Newbury enough. We ordered dress for a special occasion, were hoping to get on time, but took over 7 days, beside when dress arrived it was full damages of stitches areas, no one seem like were caring enough to check quality before it was shipped.\nWhen contacted them, which is already was waste of our time, they said take pictures and refund! Why I would waste my time on going to PO, gasoline, which is extremely expensive here in LA and we don't even have currently transportation, plus leaving to go out of town for month, we got to do that? Are you serious? And before we even make time for pictures, tell us how you help us without all the return hassle, because obviously we cant wear this dress!\nThey stated that they will replace!\nWe took pictures, but now they are asking us to return again.\nWe will be appealing charges on CC, filing BBB report and go further.\nDo not buy from this company! I can\u2019t say enough good things about our experience at Lit Boutique on Newbury Street, and it\u2019s all thanks to Allison. She went above and beyond to help my wife find the perfect outfits, making the whole shopping experience enjoyable and stress-free.\n\nAllison\u2019s sense of style and her keen eye for what would suit my wife\u2019s preferences and body type was truly impressive. She was patient, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about the latest trends. What really stood out was how she made the whole experience personal, offering thoughtful suggestions without ever being pushy.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a boutique with amazing selections and even better customer service, Lit Boutique and Allison are a must-visit. My wife left feeling confident and stylish\u2014thank you, Allison, for making it such a memorable shopping trip! Went in this weekend and the staff was so helpful and friendly! Great selection of formal and casual clothes. I usually frequent the Hanover street location but may need to start visiting this one more! Very stylish store, excellent displays, clean, staff friendly and very helpful. Love the clothes and hats. The young women in the boutique were amazing at helping me pick out some cute items! My and a friend bought 14k gold plated rings here (2 different models) and confirmed with the employee there that the ring would not tarnish. They both started tarnishing 3 weeks later and had several of the gems fall off. I also never received the receipt that I requested to be sent to my email. When I called to asked for a return they asked me to ship it in and pay for shipping. They also told me that returns can be made for up to 30 days in store - but over the phone told me that I passed the return date. Overall not satisfied at all with the product or customer service. Came here after a very long frustrating day of shopping for a fancy event. The associate Ciara was extremely helpful and was patient with me while I was getting frustrated that a lot of things were sitting the right way. She managed to find some great dresses/sets for me and I ended up picking out 3 potential outfits for the event and another dress and a pair of shoes just to have. Had an amazing experience! Yesterday, I was looking for a dress for a wedding and the sales associates helped me pick out a bunch of dresses and then styled my entire outfit for me!!! The three women working were all so helpful and personable, I will definitely be coming back!! Highly recommend! Going Going Going! Newly arrived to the Newbury shops and the change is a benefit. On the strengths of the area location is available. Beoordelen! Dutch word for \"Review\" Affordable luxuries around the town are in renovation. Etiquette and Luxury for the buyer's choice; this is the location with space for the features of the items in store.\nFind time--the elusive approach to the name and location update is a small measure. The experience of entering and getting an excitable feel for the offers is where you want to buy. Venture onto Newbury Go to Bobbles & Lace. I fell in love with this store. Being an older woman, you don't always get served very well. But the young lady working here was great. The clothes here are great. Especially if you enjoy a touch of bohemian. \ud83e\udd17 When you first enter, this seems like a smaller CVS until you realize there's a second floor. Overall good service but the store does feel a bit messy. I still don't know why they lock up some of their items. Just get better security instead of making the honest people wait around for someone to unlock the shaving cream. I was very sad today to witness a black male being racially profiled by the cashier managing the self check out section, at around 2 pm today. He asked her if they had soap containers, she told him to pay 1st & then she would help him find the soap container, she then accused him of attempting to steal when everyone there could clearly see that he wanted to buy the soap container & everything else he planned to purchase all at once.\n\nWhen the individual walked in the store, he was followed. I could hear the cashier telling the guy, \"I know what you are trying to do\". The guy replied, \" I have no idea what you are talking about\". In the end, he paid for all his items & politely thanked her even though she was extremely rude to him. I've seen this employee smoking cigarettes by the front entrance on multiple occasions so I recognized her. She is a brunette, looks like she is in her 50's, or 60's. This was very sad to watch, I really hope this review will prevent this from happening to other customers in the future. I wish there was a way to give 0 stars. Great CVS! The store itself was standard, but the staff was nice, especially Rita. Welcoming experience and I was able to get what I needed quickly! TERRIBLE customer service upstairs. We went to get passport photos done. There was 2 employees and no customers and despite us asking for help both continued doing what they were doing. Once someone finally stopped to assist us, she couldn\u2019t even tell us the pricing. We walked back out. What a great pharmacy.  I needed a prescription filled pronto and the urgent care was next door.  They were able to process my prescription within 20 minutes and Rubi was super nice Rude store employees. Condescending and discriminatory. The clothes here are by turn shockingly flimsy, thin, unlined, wildly inaccurately sized, and/or so cheaply polyester-riddled that the prices charged would be funny if they weren\u2019t so ridiculously high and then marketed as \u201csaving the planet\u201d. For this amount of money, go to a real boutique that isn\u2019t overcharging for poorly made garbage of F21 quality at low-end designer prices with store employees who act like it\u2019s straight off the runway and you ought to just feel lucky to be there. They have some of the items on the floor, but keep the rest of them in the back. They have touch screens that you can see everything they have in stock at the store including colors and sizes. You make your selections and then they\u2019re delivered to your fitting room.\n\nWe didn\u2019t end up finding the right dress, however Alex, the sales associate, was very helpful! We always get a wide variety of clothings here\u2014a handful at a time\u2014about 2-3 times a year. The prices are very good and great service as well.\n\nOne thing I find very cool here is the fitting rooms that automatically deliver clothings to you, making this a very efficient process that you can try on as many as you\u2019d like without the need to bother the staff \u2014 or feel like you\u2019re bothering someone for that matter \u2014 then you just try on a bunch, and eventually select the ones that you love.\n\nOverall, always a great experience here! The stocks are low and they don't display as many as they used to. The blond staff was super helpful and nice but the brunette one was a little snappy. She called a name for the dressing room, same as mine but my name is common so I asked her if she's talking about me. Then she shot me a look and raised her eyebrow to ask \"is there any X here\"? Not a good experience I'm afraid. I have mixed feelings for this location because they were able to solve my problem today, but I received some of the coldest service with the worst energy/vibes ever. The sales associate, Stef, was able to find a tricky order for me and refund some returns I needed to make. However, she was so cold with \u2018look you up and down\u2019 annoyance, to the point of discomfort. I felt unwelcome simply being in the store. I thanked her profusely and asked her name out of politeness, and she seemed apprehensive to give even give me my name, maybe because she\u2019s received negative reviews in the past? The other associates in the store were wonderful and very kind. Maybe she was just having a bad day, but hopefully improvements can be made so that everyone feels welcome, especially since the service is being well provided for! I bought a pair of shoes there because they had a big event but when I got home and tried them on they were weird anyways I went for a walk for a day. My left foot was hurting so bad I checked and I found that the both side of shoes are different size. they sold me a pair in different sizes a size 7 and an 8. I also knew that it was an event and that I couldn't return it. So I called them and asked them, and they apologized to me first and told me to bring the shoes. But that was last summer and I was traveling a lot overseas and out of state so I couldn't go to Boston. Yesterday, five months later, I picked up the shoes and they gave me a new shoe box with both sides the same size.The first mistake was theirs but I can forgive them because it was a very busy day. But they fixed their mistake and I was satisfied with their service. It is burdensome to return the shoes only with their credit but I think I won't miss the fun of stopping by every time I pass by and looking at the shoes. Special thanks to Adriana. NEVER BUY FROM TREND BOSTON!!\n\nI have NEVER, dealt with such unprofessionalism ever in my life. The worst customer service of any company I\u2019ve ever purchased from. They have been ignoring my emails to return an item for over a week now. They initially answered and said they would look into it and get back to me. No one has ever gotten back to me. I ordered the wrong size of shoe and was going to be glad to buy the correct pair back from them. But no way in hell will I do that now. Not to mention the box the shoes come in was damaged and their response was \u201cthe item was not damaged\u201d. Like how clueless are you to think that the items ORIGINAL BOX is not part of the Item! So unacceptable. I\u2019ve been buying shoes online for years. This was the worst customer service I have ever had in my life. Our family had an amazing experience at TREND Boston! The staff went above and beyond to take care of us, offering excellent advice and helping us find the perfect shoes. They even brought different options for us to try on, ensuring we got the best fit and style. Their attention to detail and customer service made our shopping experience truly enjoyable. We bought 3 pairs of ON Cloud shoes with a great deal. We highly recommend TREND Boston for anyone looking for quality shoes and outstanding service! Worst store in Boston, would recommend anyone not to shop there.\n- Poor and non-transparent policies\n- Returns only against exchange for other items or store credit, but you are not informed about this before the purchase\n- However, this should be possible for foreign customers, as we will never return to the store again\n- Extremely many consultants and therefore a confusion of opinions\n- Staff talk to each other a lot, even during the sales talk in the middle of the conversation with the customer Hello,\n\nI just received an email of the owner responding to a review made from my account.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience it may have caused, it was not me who did it. May sound weird but could have been my younger sibling. Sorry again. Store is great. Awesome location & great staff! They do however have a NO Return AND NO Exchange policy. The product I purchased is easily mixed up. I purchased a water based lube instead of an oil based and it was completely sealed along with the receipt from 2 hours prior BUT, they refused to even entertain the notion of an exchange for the right product. Can't say I'll ever walk in or recommend the shop, just for this reason. The policy should be at the discretion of the sales associate, since a sealed bottle of lube doesn't really pose a health risk to anyone buying it thereafter. Friendly, but store is pretty empty. It sounded like they had this huge selection on condoms, like exotic stuff, but they have just the regular stuff, stuff you buy on cvs/walgreens. Very feminine tailored, not much for men. The place was decent I guess...when I whipped my hog out and started trying on rubbers the salesperson gave me an attitude....customer service is dead. Great staff, very friendly. Awesome  place to buy gifts. Expensive prices and the workers there are kind of rude and not very informative My reviews are usually based on mobility-impaired folks and I can say this IS THE SPOT if you want downtown Boston and you need to drive... As you can see in my pictures plenty of places to park at about 9:30 on a weeknight... But this part of the street the stores are all pretty much shut down at this hour and there are at least 5 spots you could park for a few minutes and not get towed or ticketed.\nAs for the weed I'll let you know LOL my first time here very kind, queen, professional, knowledgeable, they follow the law to the letter, and it's good to see because there's so many young people out there but they are not getting it here that's for sure without a valid ID! Bravo guys! Great experience! First time in Boston, and I stumbled upon this dispensary by surprise. Honey helped me out and answered several questions. Amazing service from start to finish. I've never been to a cannabis dispensary in Massachusetts, so I decided to check this place out. Coming from Florida, this concept is really new to me; it's a like a new era, almost like the end of the alcohol prohibition back in the day.\n\nWalking in, I waited in a short line to check in; they scan your ID and buzz you in. The place was cleanand organized. I was greeted by a person giving out free cookies (which were delicious). I was helped out immediately by a sales associate and she showed me the kiosk to look for products to order. The whole process was quick and easy.  The place was bustling since it's right on the busy Newbury St. Also a big plus is, this place is owned by BIPOC (black, indigenous, and other people there of color). Probably the best dispo I\u2019ve found in Boston (coming from someone with experience in the industry) since moving out here. I will go out of my way to stock up with them even if something else is closer.\n\nEveryone on staff is friendly and helpful. They maintain the perfect balance between selling and listening to the needs of the customers. Plus most of the time when they\u2019re trying to sell to you it\u2019s usually a deal to save you money or a recommendation that\u2019ll genuinely help your cannabis experience be so much better. Excellent, plentiful discounts on a variety of brands and lovely management but the team itself is where it\u2019s at :)\n\nThank you guys for taking care of your Newbury Street neighbors and seeming to actually care about the giving back to the community rather than it being another checkmark for CCC. First time visiting a dispensary and couldn't recommend it enough. I was assisted with the ordering system by a lovely man called Holden who was incredibly helpful with operating the tablet ordering system. Will definitely be visiting again during my visit Jamie did an amazing job with my layers! The service was truly exceptional, and I truly appreciated her suggestions\u2014they made all the difference. The final cut turned out even better than I imagined. My hair feels and looks fantastic! Highly recommend Jamie to anyone looking for a great haircut and professional service. I recently had my hair styled by Jamie, and she did an amazing job! She listened to exactly what I wanted and delivered perfectly. Jamie gave me the perfect layered hair with super cute bangs. She also provided some really helpful hairstyle tips that I can use daily. Highly recommend her services! This was my first time visiting the salon! I was here for a haircut and Wes did an amazing job with my hair giving me great looking layers\ud83e\udd29 I'd recommend getting your hair done by Wes cuz she's truly sweet. Jamie was super amazing for my haircut and blowout! I have curly/wavy hair, and was nervous about losing too much of my length when getting layers, but she was super understanding and listened to everything I wanted and executed it perfectly. She was also super sweet and fun to talk with the whole time as well! Overall, could not have had a better experience and I\u2019m very happy with my hair! :) I had such a great experience with Jamie at the salon! From the start of my visit to the end! Jamie took the time to ask me exactly what I wanted before we got started, and I showed her some pictures for inspiration. She absolutely nailed it! I asked for long layers and face-framing pieces, and she delivered exactly what I envisioned. Not only is she super talented, but she\u2019s also so sweet and friendly. The head massage during my wash was the cherry on top! Highly recommend Jamie! I love the calm, unpretentious, oasis in the city that is Balans! I\u2019ve greatly enjoyed my facials and most recently I had a really fantastic deep tissue massage with Cristina. She attended to my sore shoulder, back, glute and calf muscles in the most intuitive way while also incorporating soothing head and neck movements. I left feeling that good post-massage sore feeling as well as feeling completely relaxed. Would definitely seek her out again! Thanks to her and the Balans\u2019 team for a great experience! I had the most wonderful experience with Cristina! She worked her strong hands magically to release all the tension in my upper back, shoulders and neck. I feel 10 years younger\ud83e\udd0d It was a 60 minute massage but next time I will know to book additional time for this luxurious treatment. Thank you! My 90 minute massage with Cristina was absolutely amazing!!! Cristina truly goes above and beyond to tailor your massage experience to your body and comfort. She does a great job setting the mood with guided breathing and essential oils. She is very receptive to working on certain areas of the body. I have past injuries and tightness around surrounding areas and she was very understanding. She helped me with breathing through tighter areas and her kind, warm demeanor always made me feel supported and safe. I would recommend Cristina to anyone because she is a fantastic massage therapist and a very sweet and kind person! Absolutely hands down the best massage experience I\u2019ve ever had thanks to Christina! From the moment I walked in, I felt instantly relaxed. The atmosphere was calm, soothing, and welcoming, setting the perfect tone. Christina is incredible\u2014so attentive and skillfully worked through all the tension and knots in my muscles. It felt like she intuitively knew exactly where to focus, leaving me feeling completely rejuvenated and at ease. I walked out feeling lighter, stress-free, and more balanced than I have in a very long time. Truly an exceptional experience, and I can\u2019t wait to return! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a top-notch massage. Not a good experience here.  My husband and I went here on 4/5/25 and to be honest the experience was not very good especially for the price point.  We each booked a 60 minute massage and facial.  The total price for this package ( 2 massages, 2 facials) was around $750 without gratuity. We had massage booked first followed by facials in separate rooms. Now,  my massage with Laila was actually good.  She's talented and if you want a strong massage, book with her.  My husband's massage was good, not great.  Laila is the reason this place got more than one star from us. Once the massage was done,  we waited for our facials for 55 minutes not exaggerating.  There was no mention that we would have a gap between sessions and we weren't updated on this long of a wait.  Whatever,  it wasn't great but oh well.  After going into separate rooms for the facials, we started the service.  Seeing the reviews here,  we were shocked at how bad the facials were.  Both of us left our separate rooms and mutually agreed that the facials were just bad.  Terrible massaging/ caressing,  with very limp hands. It was not good. Lots of reasons it was not good besides the massage.  My husband had no extractions done because they said he didn't need it.  That's hilarious,  he has blackheads,  Like what? His session ended 15 minutes early.  We both really were shocked at this as somehow this place was listed in 2024 as the best in Boston for facials.  Absolutely impossible based on what we both experienced today.  I was so bothered during the facial at the quality that I mentioned for more pressure but it just didn't feel that the experience was worth over 200 dollars and I was not relaxed just thinking about how much we were overpaying.  I really don't like to make a bad review,  honestly I rarely do.  My husband tried to complain but didn't get anywhere and I would rather people know what they may receive especially when spending a decent amount of money.  Avoid facials here. Delicia was great! I haven\u2019t had a wax in over a year and it was gonna sting a little bit but I didn\u2019t feel much of anything.  The conversation was so good next thing I know we were done and I was walking out.  Great experience with her!! I had a bad experience with the Brazilian I got here. The job was definitely rushed to get in more customers and not only was it poorly done with about 25% of the hair remaining but I had a very negative reaction after that I\u2019m still dealing with.\nOn top of that, them shoving their products down your throat, asking for a tip publicly, and pushing you to rebook \u201cbecause we just fill up so early\u201d was the cherry on top.\nBut I guess I shouldn\u2019t expect much from a place that profits off the insecurity of women. Did the new client offer and got a free eyebrow wax with Sabita! She was so gentle and efficient and preserved my brow shape and thickness and just made it much cleaner. Highly recommend! The place is also very peaceful and clean. I had an amazing experience with Delicia! She is very friendly and made me feel comfortable through my entire appointment. I will definitely be booking with her again! I GOT A MAJOR WAX BURN. While doing my Brazilian I kept telling the wax specialist that the wax was too hot, but she said it was normal. I check my body the next day and there was a huge scar/scab on my skin.\n\nUNPROFESSIONAL. The wax specialist left many little pieces of wax on my skin & I didn\u2019t realize it until I got back home.\n\nRUSHED. This service felt like it was only 10 min because my wax specialist was rushing the service. She did not allow the wax to cool a little when she took it out of the waxing pot.\n\nDo not go to this place. Fluevog truly went above and beyond for me! After my original package was stolen, they didn\u2019t hesitate to send me a replacement, and it arrived quickly. The team was so understanding and genuinely cared. Plus, the shoes I bought are absolutely adorable and even better in person! It\u2019s rare to find a store that stands by their customers like this, and I\u2019m beyond impressed with both their products and service. Highly recommend Fluevog if you\u2019re looking for cute shoes and a team that genuinely cares about your experience! These are the most amazing shoes on earth. Material possessions mean nothing to me. Except Fluevog shoes and  my 2 Harleys. The staff is so fun to talk to and helpful.  I have been wearing Fluevogs since 1985. I LOVE this store. Wonderful shoes and wonderful people! This store is well worth a visit if you're looking for an awesome pair of shoes.  Martina was such a pleasure to deal with too.  Highly recommended! Do you like shoes? Do you like beautiful shoes? Do you like buying beautiful shoes in a charming space, assisted by lovely, helpful, hilarious staff? Then this place is for you.\nIf you don't like those things, you should probably go somewhere else. I order all my shoes from this store and have them shipped. The best customer service I have ever received. Always exciting to get your shoes in the mail and a special note from who packed them. Like you Rock those shoes! They always include a dust bag for your shoes, groovy pins, and logo stickers. I love John Fluevog's shoes. They make you feel extraordinary, and your feet feel like heaven on earth \ud83c\udf10. Jeff Casler and his whole managment and crew are thieves. I have been robbed of $3k+ of my items and payout over a period of 2 weeks. The store closed ubruptly and ran off with my and many other consignees money belongings. Its sad to think a store in the middle of boston will do such things. Police report has filed and my lawyer has been notified. See you in court jeff and all your friends. Great customer service.. Everything\u2019s authentic and they have lots of vintage merchandise.. reasonable with prices and fair to their customers.. great prices and good service Staff is so rude prices are high This Abercrombie is clean and organized. They have a good selection of clothing for both men and women. The store is quite small but there is still a good variety. Buyer beware, the reviews of rude employees is pretty accurate. When I visited, two employees were side-eyeing and laughing at a customer. I would say it's worth stopping in, but not worth it to stick around. Honestly, it is not great. I was followed around the store while my white friend was NOT. If you are anything above an 8 forget it they do not have your size. I thought that the company was trying to cater to a wider audience but I guess that\u2019s just for show. Super disappointed will not even try to get anything from them online. Rude staff and 'manager'. Asked to be contacted due to a receipt issue and was never contacted. Staff never bothered to knock and opened the door to changing patrons, didn't bother to help with sizes, tons of attitude to clarify a simple question on receipts. Awful shopping experience run by people that don't care about anyone's shopping experience. Great service I love how we can customize the light in the fitting room What is the point of placing an online order at this store?? When you get there, they tell you that you have to wait in line?? My item is already paid for. So dumb!! Will not be returning or purchasing anything from here again!!! The shipping was incredibly fast, and the customs clearance was smooth and hassle-free. I am truly impressed by their efficiency and reliability. Highly recommend!\" \"DHL provided excellent service\u2014fast shipping, smooth customs clearance, and they took great care of my package. Everything arrived in perfect condition. Highly satisfied!\" Sent a shipment to Pakistan,the guy named Shrey was really helpful with details and made sure my package was taped and secured right in front of me.  Recommended 100%! Review for DHL\n\nI recently sent a package to India and my experience was excellent. Mr. Shrey was extremely helpful and easy to talk to. He took the time to explain everything clearly, making the entire process smooth and hassle-free.\n\nI am very satisfied with the service and would highly recommend DHL Great service, very professional and thorough.\nThe person who helped me I think his name is Sherem. 5 stars I got a really good haircut for an affordable price (pretty much exactly what I wanted plus a new hair product to buy) l, and despite my general anxiety, I felt comfortable the whole time\u2014both to engage in conversation and not. Overview: Ron from Ojees is my go-to stylist this year (2024).\nWhy: His sweet soft-spoken demeanor puts me at ease, while he takes the time to ask how I'd like my hair done. He's very detailed and always makes sure my haircut is done precisely the way I want it.\nPrice: Totally Reasonable. Thanks to him I feel so much more confident as I stroll around Back Bay sporting a cut that looks like I spent ten times as much!\nRecommend: Strongly. I have recommended him to friends and family, and they all love him too!\nRon is a rare jewel in the otherwise pricy city of Boston. \ud83d\udc4d Popped in as a walk in. I\u2019m from out of town and it\u2019s great to know that I can go back to a good barber if I ever need a haircut when I\u2019m back in town for work. Ron was quick, talented and super friendly! Definitely recommend did a great hair cut on my little one! friendly and the cut and style came out great! Go see Ron! I just received the best haircut I\u2019ve ever had. Coming from a guy who has been going to traditional barbershops my whole life, I highly recommend Ron. He took great care and detail into my otherwise simple haircut. I purchased a custom-made suit for my wedding from Classic Tuxedo, costing approximately $3,000. In addition, nearly ten of my groomsmen rented their tuxedos from the establishment. Unfortunately, the quality and service did not live up to expectations, and the experience was nothing short of disastrous.\n\nBefore even arriving at the church, the buttons on my tuxedo pants ripped off, as well as the back button on my wallet pocket. After just one dry cleaning, the suit material became extremely shiny and cheap-looking, a shocking outcome for something custom-made at such a high price point.\n\nThe worst part came during the reception. As soon as the groomsmen started dancing, three of their suits ripped. One was so severe that my groomsman had to leave the reception entirely, as the tear went from the bottom to the crotch. Another groomsman\u2019s jacket ripped right down the back seam, and a third experienced a similar issue in the crotch area.\n\nOn top of these quality issues, the alterations were poorly done, making the overall fit subpar. I cannot stress enough how disappointing this was, especially on such an important day. If you want your wedding to go smoothly and not be marred by wardrobe malfunctions, I strongly recommend shopping elsewhere. My fianc\u00e9 had an incredible experience having a custom made tuxedo for an upcoming wedding with Daiane! She was so kind and amazing to work with. Overall he had 3 fittings so the tuxedo is truly perfect for him. We had such a great experience we will be back in a few months to get his suit for our wedding! Daiane is the gem of Newbury! Incredibly helpful. I was on a rush on the way to work in need of an emergency tux shirt for a wedding. She had me measured and paired with the perfect match in literally 10 minutes. My new home base for everything tuxedo or tailor related. Choosing Classic Tuxedo was one of the best decisions I made for my wedding. They are extremely professional, Leo and his crew do outstanding work. They were able to accommodate my entire wedding party with tux rentals, they even made it easy for my out of town groomsmen to get fitted online. My tux is by far the most comfortable suit I\u2019ve ever worn. They made my wedding day easy, and made me look amazing. I 100% recommend using classic tuxedo for your big day! They were even able to sew my mothers wedding dress on the inside of my custom tux, which was very important to me and such a nice touch. Wonderful service! Best tuxedo spot in Boston, hands down. I shopped around locations for my wedding, and the service, professionalism, and quality of products at Classic Tuxedo were unparalleled. From beginning to end, the attention to fit, fabric, and cut of the tuxedo made the whole process seamless. I liked the tuxedo so much I ended up purchasing rather than renting. I also had my groomsmen get their tuxedos here, and they had equally superb experiences! Don't go to the menswear chain stores on Newbury or at the mall! You won't get the same experience. Small businesses like this one are hard to find these days, and you won't regret making this your first and last stop when looking for a tux. Couple years ago I had my prescription fulfilled at Q optical, for which I chose a SWISSFLEX classic!\nKnowledgeable staff, friendly and BEST SERVICE in the BOSTON area!\nHighly recommended!! the lady was mad rude and refused to help me, then I went to the optics shop next door and they are extremely helpful I highly recommend ditching this lady for them \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 My glasses flew off my face. I caught them in my hands that grasped out with the instincts of someone who has been essentilly blind without them since 4th grade.  The winds were violently strong that day.  The stem of the right side lens popped off as these sometimes do, but usually you just pop it back in. The rain was slashing sideways in its force, and the cold of New England's winter was ehind every gale. Gutters of ice cold water were running over my feet and I looked into the gutter in vain for the stem. I thought, \"This is insane, I will never find a straw-shaped stem in a torrent of gushing cold water.\"  I was right.\nI got home and fumed to myself.  it would do no one any good to lash out with these feelings. As a man with an absolute requirement to have lenses to see, this was not  minor setback.\nThen I realized, rather quickly, that eyephorics at 2.5 grams total weight, were actually quite stable with one stem.  I thought, maybe I can live with these like Colonel Klink in Hogan's Heroes.  One stem suporting the full 2 lenses.\nIt was not a good plan.  Every time I bent over the would slip off mu face. Looking at a package in the lobby I would end up collecting my lenses from the floor.And sometimes they would slip in favor of the supporting side.\nIt is the pandemic, and Michelle Quintero was my \"go to\" for all things eyewear and even more - eyesight.  What many people buying her fabulous eyewear have no idea about is this: she is an amazing doctor. When I renewed my presecription, she evaluated my eyeight medically, not just in support of my cosmetic requirements.\nAnyway, the pandemic.\nMichelle has been influenced by the pandemic like most. Her shop is not open every day as we remember pre-pandemic.  What were my options I wondered on that day I was clearly in need of a replacement. I just can't go to any eyeglasses shop. They all sit on my face and dig into my nose and are heavy and too much work.  Michelle's offerings were of a different level altogether!\nAfter e-mailing her that day, I got a text.\nMiichelle was there for me... \"what did I need?  wht could she do? \"  I responded that I wanted a simple re-do of my last order.\nIt is now only days later, and I'm looking to pick up my replacement lenses.\nKudos to Michelle.  I am indebted! I recently had an eye appointment at Q Optical on Newbury Street in Boston. I was very happy to go to a local place since I live in the Back Bay. The staff and doctor were very friendly and their selection of fashion eyewear was better than any place I have ever been to. Best eye glasses in Boston...hands down!  The owner is incredibly helpful and honest in terms of what glasses are the ideal fit for your face. Immediately kindly greeted by lovely ladies. As busy as they were, they still took me as a walk in and Jolia did outstanding on my nails. She did a perfect chrome gel x french tip, and  made sure there were no flaws with my set. My first experience at MiniLuxe and I will now be switching to here! Edit: Downgraded my rating to 1* because I broke out in an itchy rash everywhere the massage oil was used on my neck and back.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nReally disappointing gel manicure/nail art and shoulder/neck massage. The gel manicure ended up on my fingers and cuticles and the nail art turned out badly (see attached pictures for what I asked for vs. what I got). The entire appointment lasted under 45 mins and cost ~$100 before tip. Don\u2019t go to Miniluxe, it\u2019s a waste of money for disappointing results. I had a really awful experience. I reserved a gel polish with French tip. First off my technician didn\u2019t even know I wanted a French tip, and then didn\u2019t buff my nails or trim properly and brutalized my fingers, I actually bled a little after service. She rushed and was staring off in the distance the entire time like she didn\u2019t want to be there which made me really uncomfortable and didn\u2019t put enough layers into the gel or any care into the French tip which made it bubble up at the tips and soak deep under my nails. And then at the end she took a filer and coarse filed my tips which broke the seal and made them crack open. For 70$ (I didn\u2019t even get extensions or anything)  this is horrendous and I was even given attitude when I didn\u2019t tip according to expectation at the end. Never coming back. I recently had the pleasure of getting my nails done by Jolia for the Lunar New Year, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results! Jolia is incredibly talented and created the most adorable and intricate Lunar New Year designs.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and comfortable. Jolia is friendly, professional, and clearly passionate about her work. I gave her creativity freedom to do her own design on my nails.\n\nThe entire experience was relaxing and enjoyable. Jolia's attention to detail is impeccable, and my nails look stunning. I'm already planning my next visit!\n\nI highly recommend booking with Jolia! You won't be disappointed. Jolia did an amazing job! I got shot gel x nails with mirror chrome and they turned out great!! Definitely will be coming back This Abercrombie is clean and organized.

It was my first time visiting an anime store in person and the staff there was really nice and helpful, and there were lots of cool things on display! ^^ I liked the entrance in particular and the inside had a comfy vibe, and I would definitely visit again! Went to this store looking for very specific stuff. Both Lacey and Tre were super helpful. They spent half an hour helping me find exactly what I wanted.\nIt's a great store with pretty impressive collection for anime lovers and of course super amazing staff! Thank you. I enjoy finding practical yet novelty gifts for my nerdy little family, and this store has a budget for everyone! Always exceptional customer service- I was helped by Lacey & Tre, and then checked out by Tati- a group of lovely folks who were all welcoming and knowledgeable about the stores items. Thanks guys! My daughter was on a the hunt for a specific pusheen plush, we came to anime zakka after a google search and it did not disappoint. Vinny ( one of the customer services guys) went above and beyond to search for said pusheen, his customer service was excellent. What  an awesome store, delivering adorable quality goods and amazing customer service. Thank you so much Vinny!! One of the only places I\u2019ve been to that have had the Mofusand hippers in stock! Such friendly and helpful staff. Shout out Tati! She\u2019s super sweet and they all made my day! Great place to Shop in back bay, right next to Newbury street. Huge selection of Craft beer, liquor and wine ( from value to top class)\nPrices are very competitive and store layout is must see. Staff is very friendly and helpful ! The store has great collection of wines and whiskey, all the employees and the owner is customer friendly. Great experience! Awesome store with a great selection!\nThe staff is always friendly and willing to help, making each visit a breeze. Prices are competitive and fair compared to other local shops. Always my top choice for a quick stop! I recently visited this store and was thoroughly impressed by their extensive variety of liquors. They have an outstanding selection of wines, spirits, and beers from around the world, catering to all tastes and preferences.

With its clean environment, great selection of clothes, and excellent service, it's a top choice for shoppers in the area. Highly recommended! The store is about what you come to expect when you visit a Macy\u2019s across the United States. They have departments for Men, women and children. Good clothes and you can sometimes get a deal. The store was well-organized despite the busy season, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I was thrilled to find a wide variety of quality items at unbeatable discounts. It was a great opportunity to shop and save\u2014definitely one of the best Black Friday shopping experiences I've had! Just went into the store on Newbury, disappointed by their customer service and lack of interest/knowledge on North Face products. The woman who helped me showed little or no interest. There was another unfriendly young man who I asked if there were more colors, and he said \"yeah there are, I don't know them off the top of my head\". Hope they can do better next time. Wonderful and Unique Experience at Your Store, Thanks to Adrian\n\nI wanted to share my exceptional experience at your retail store, which was made truly memorable by Adrian's outstanding assistance.\n\nFrom the moment I entered, Adrian's professionalism and friendliness stood out. Their deep knowledge about the products and willingness to help went above and beyond my expectations. Thanks to Adrian's efforts, I not only found exactly what I needed but also left the store feeling great about the entire shopping experience.\n\nIt's not often that one encounters such dedicated and exceptional service. Adrian is a true asset to your team, and their commitment to customer satisfaction is commendable.\n\nThank you once again for a fantastic experience. I look forward to visiting your store again soon.\n\nBest regards,\nJulian Aguirre Nice shop Super helpful staff and a good variety of products for men and women. They can also order items for you from the website. I brought my husband\u2019s winter jacket for the warranty repair in December 2022. I filled out the form, and was told that I will receive confirmation e-mail shortly. I didn\u2019t take picture of the drop off form (my mistake but no one told me to do so either). It has been almost 6 weeks, and I  don\u2019t have any confirmation e-mail. Called the store multiple times and received the worst customer service. Their answer is basically we don\u2019t see it at all in our warranty bin, so there is no record of me dropping it off (it\u2019s a $400 jacket that had broke zipper!) I was told they can\u2019t help me at all, and I need to deal with the customer service directly.\nUnpleasant customer service experience, I was told manager will call me back asap and never heard back from them. Very disappointed with the store and the way things have been handled. I will have to try their main customer service line and see if someone can help me there. Great store that's very well-decorated/designed. Not really my type of store, but there's a good selection of stuff here, including some cool maps and field guides. Lots of solid equipment for the outdoors too! Easily one of the best stores to go to get camping related gear!\n\nI just simply went to see it, but it\u2019s so difficult to come out without buying something \ud83d\ude2b\n\nThe staff is very polite and when I told them that I was here just to visit, they still kindly walked me over to various sections.\n\nI saw a lot of people come here for bikes, so those must be good here.\n\nI\u2019m definitely coming back here to buy camping related gear for whenever I go! I do understand the care for the planet earth but I bought approximately 7 items from that store and I have not been offered a bag. I\u2019ve been told I can place my items in a shoe box I want to as they don\u2019t have any bags?!\n\nPoor customer service. Spent an hour in the store. Not a single person approached with any help. 3 members of they staff been chatting about their holidays.\nIf you want to experience a good outdoor store better to visit the signature stores like Patagonia which is next door where service is excellent and you don\u2019t need to search for a sales person to help you with your inquiry. Best around by far. Been keeping a lid on how good for a while, but alas, they deserve their credit. You're all welcome! Knowledge, service, parts- it's all top notch. I have an extremely technical bike and they're always able to repair and modify it expertly when needed. Wouldn't skip it if you have any issues. They're great. Nick is a premium human and a superb bike technician! He had my bike in and out like the wind, and taught me a few things about bikes along the way. Amazing to have such friendly, knowledgeable service at this shop. I\u2019ll definitely be back! Shirley Ramroop, branch manager, incredibly rude. Told me to \u201cmake up my mind\u201d when I told her exactly what I wanted in our meeting. I also felt like I was being talked down on, as if I don\u2019t know anything about banking. Fortunately for me, I attend Boston College. So, I do know banking. Shirley only started to be kind to me once I asked what her name was. Horrible experience, typical American customer service. Don\u2019t go here, find a different bank. Love this Bank. Always enjoy seeing my boy Steven(Stevie my Boy as I say). And every teller there is completely professional and I enjoy chatting with all of them. I\u2019m practically live at the bank when I am there almost every day lol. Customer service is terrific at this Santander Bank Branch. I want to especially recognize, Shirley, the Branch Manager, as I was having an issue with the national customer service line not giving me the information that I needed to help my elderly Aunt (my Aunt is a customer, I am not) and Shirley was so kind, patient and highly effective in helping me to find the solution to my Aunt's issue.  Shirley took the time to contact customer service even though the wait time was almost 20 minutes.  She was able to multi-task and help other customers at the same time she helped me and didn't miss a beat. If you are looking for a bank branch with exceptional customer service and a highly skilled and effective branch manager (Yay, Shirley) I would recommend this Santander branch on Boylston Street. Communication is seriously lacking. Elmira is sorely missed. My account is being charged unknown to me who is doing this. No one is here to help, and app is not efficient. However there are still a few bright spots in this branch Avoid this bank. Complete incompetence and total lack of care for dealing with estate accounts. Inaccurate, unprofessional, unethical, inexperienced and no follow up skills. Do yourself a favor and avoid this branch. They have cost my wife endless hours and the end result is having to fly back into Boston just to fix something they could have resolved when she was there in person. A complete lack of empathy and respect in dealing with estate accounts. Great student culture in the dorm, I would recommend staying here if you ever attend MIT Fantastic people and a river view. miss bc my sister lives here Very loud Love this boba shop! I like my bubbles firm and chewy and their bubbles was dense and chewy in a good way. I got the osmanthus oolong tea with cheese foam at 50 percent. I really like the tea flavor which had floral notes. The cheese foam was good too but I don\u2019t think I will get it again because it did make the drink heavy once mixed in I got a brown sugar, milk tea with cheese foam which was decent to satisfy the craving, but I thought it wasn\u2019t cold enough unfortunately. The Boba was not fully cooked so the center was still a bit too chewy. My friend also got a taro smoothie which was kind of bland considering that it was mostly just ice. Fresh fruit, good serving size! If you aren\u2019t looking to get more than one topping I think it\u2019s a pretty good deal. Flavor was awesome, I ended up getting the lime jasmine tea and the flavors blended very well together. One thing to note is that toppings cost extra and are 0.50 to a 1.00 each so there is that, but quality tea here! The jasmine fruit tea was awesome. I would reduce sugar level to 0 if you get mango popping boba like I did They do not exchange drinks if they messed up? Only place I\u2019ve ever been to that does that, I took one sip of the Thai Ice tea with Boba and it tasted like straight milk. She didn\u2019t want to remake it either. Pretty sad. Go to Gong cha instead! Unintentionally went on black Friday and got a 20% discount!! The workers were super nice and if you spend over $50 you get something for free, which I got a Kirby hand cream!\n\nI was very happy to see they had kikuo merchandise! Unfortunately I'm dissapointed with how the keychains turned out. The black keychain had broken off and you can see there's evident scratches :( Same with the invisible keychain, there's clear scratches on it which made me sad.\n\nHowever the bag and shake-y keychain came out well! Only a make up stain was on the bag but I was able to clean it up. I wish I took a photo of the kikuo stand for anyone who's a fan and wants to know the selection.. the keychains are stocked, however the price seems high \ud83d\ude22 regardless I had so much fun! I enjoyed my shopping experience at Reiwatakiya very much. I recognized some of the brands I used to purchase when I lived in Japan and it brought me back. The cosmetics are reasonably priced for being imported from Japan and Korea. The sales person assisted me with finding the perfect match of a cushion foundation recommended a black liquid eye liner, and helped me find some skin care products too. I also picked up some snacks for my son which he of course loved. I wish I had purchased more but now I have an excuse to go back. The Asia Store, which sells all stuff we see in the Asia instagram reels. Fun visit, I loved the fact about community engagement and loyalty Asian people have for their culture and products.\n\nA great pop up experience. just kinda wish the workers were more interactive with customers but overall such a cute store:) I really really do like this store and wish they had more locations but this one in particular is WAY too small and gets overwhelmingly crowded quickly. A lot of the testers are missing or in bad condition which makes it difficult to try stuff before you buy, or if they do have a tester, they'll probably be out of stock for that specific shade. That being said I love that they have &honey products as well as a lot of affordable K/J beauty skincare and makeup options. I just wish they could move to a larger store and do a bit better making sure testers are available and useable. Amazing experience! Lynda is such a sweetheart and her work is beautiful. She did such a good job and I was so happy with my hair. The place is really cute too and has a very comfy feel to it. Lynda was amazing! I needed a haircut and it was so amazing that I went back for a hair updo for a gala that I had. OMG, simply the best updo I have ever had. She TOTALLY nailed the idea that I had and everyone kept asking me the whole night who had done my hair. Moreover, my mother, who is almost impossible to please, totally loved it and told me to NEVER loose her phone number \ud83e\udd23 Lynda did a great job with my hair and also my hair extensions today! She\u2019s very nice, patient and I got just what I was looking for! Also was THE BEST at cutting my hair as I wanted. 5 stars to Lynda. I have complete confidence in Lynda for an excellent haircut! She removed split ends while maintaining length. My hair looks perky and healthy now. She gave me the beautiful fuss-free haircut I wanted, as well as great advice for maintaining hair health. lynda is amazing! she is so kind and amazing with blowouts. my hair is super curly and i was a little worried about it lasting but it\u2019s lasted all weekend and i haven\u2019t even had to do any touch ups! i\u2019m in love with the results Simply unbelievable. The nicest collection of eyewear I\u2019ve ever seen, hosted by the nicest owner I\u2019ve ever met. Ahmed has an eye for collecting the finest pieces, always offers incredible deals (even better than I\u2019ve seen online), and is unbelievably generous with his time in advising his customers and helping them repair and maintain their eyewear. Visiting Ahmed\u2019s shop is like a trip to your best friend\u2019s house and a candy store all in one; I will never buy glasses anywhere else again. I now return to Point of U every time I am in the area, regardless whether I am shopping or not, just to see the new items and say hi. If you have ever been interested in glasses, and you happen to be in the area, please stop in, you will regret missing it. Got two pairs of high end glasses. One was great, the other I got wrong lense after a super long wait. But the owner was able to fix the problem in a very pleasure way. He waive the lense cost and deliver the correct one super fast directly to my home with gift. Very patient with me the whole time! Will come back for my next one for sure! Had the pleasure of getting eyewear from Ahmed, he offers great customer service and the store has the hottest glasses you can find. 10/10 recommend. Beautiful shop and exceptional service! Ahmed was not only knowledgeable and skilled but also kind and gracious. He went above and beyond, sharing a high professional standard and a thoughtful personal touch to our experience. We could not be happier for the opportunity to meet him or to recommend Point of U! Ahmed, thank you for making a difference! I bought glasses from another optical shop that made me dizzy, so I went to Mr. Ahmed to have my glasses fixed. He used his professional skills to quickly find the problem with my glasses and fixed them for me. What touched me the most was that he didn't charge me anything even though I didn't buy my glasses from him. I will definitely buy glasses here in the future! Because I think with Mr. Ahmed around, the quality of the glasses will definitely be good! Boston Shawerma is honestly one of my favorite spots. The food is super high quality and the prices are really reasonable. With any order, they give you a free Dasani water which is such a nice touch. The people there are so kind and welcoming every time I go in.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how generous the owner is. I saw a few delivery drivers come in to pick up orders, and the owner offered them food and drinks just out of kindness. You don\u2019t see that often. It\u2019s the kind of place that makes you feel good about supporting a local business. Great food, great people, great vibes. The Shawarma tastes great. But I don\u2019t have any service. The sauce smells like peanut. The price is higher than I expected. The staff is very sweet and friendly. Unfortunately, the shawarmas my friend and I got were bland and did not taste like shawarma meat. Similarly, the baklava was underwhelming \u2014 flavorless and lacking in pistachios and rose flavoring. what an insanely large portion and so much variety in food in one plate. solid flavors too, I wouldn\u2019t say the meat was incredible but it wasn\u2019t distractingly dry or anything. It\u2019s solid. it\u2019s like a time machine to when things were 5$, i think 20$ is worth it when you get a bit of everything and they aren\u2019t trying to pinch pennies on the size of a falafel or meat like cava Solid shawarma spot with generous protein. The food was served very quickly so this spot is perfect on the go too. The food is really flavorful too so I do think this is also very worth the price that you pay. Would highly recommend stopping by here to grab a quick meal! I walked into Ministry of Supply feeling completely lost. I had never worn a suit before, had no clue about my size, and wasn\u2019t sure what style would even look good on me. Honestly, I was kind of panicking. But within minutes, Zariya put me at ease. She was incredibly professional, guiding me through the options and helping me find the perfect fit\u2014without any pressure or confusion. From the moment I stepped in to the moment I checked out, the whole process took just 30 minutes.\n\nZariya and Jan were both so friendly! I actually enjoyed the experience, instead of feeling stressed. They made me feel comfortable, like I wasn\u2019t just another customer but someone they genuinely wanted to help.\n\nAnd the clothes? Amazing. I wore my new outfit for a full day of walking around, and not once did I feel restricted or uncomfortable. The fabric moves with you, breathes well, and looks sharp. Plus, the store even offers a $25 tailoring credit, which is a great bonus.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who dreads shopping for work clothes, go to Ministry of Supply. They make it easy, and you\u2019ll walk out looking and feeling great. Love the stuff and ambiance.  Staffs are friendly. Clothes are amazing. So glad I had the chance to stop in and try them on before ordering online. I know my sizes better. Walked out with some great items. The Apollo shirts are the best you'll ever wear.   Staff here are so helpful and friendly!  Highly recommend this store and third products. Visited many different suit shops on Newbury st and this one was the best by far. The staff was actually kind and I felt like a belonged there. The atmosphere was calming, sleek and fun/exciting. Their product is top of the line and felt amazing and they really care about the customer and others. For those in need they even give big discounts or even free suits. I am a huge fan now have been there a few times and got my wedding suit there.\n\nThey gave some discounts for when I got my suit tailored and let me tell you, I could dance in this suit and I wasent uncomfortable it really is amazing tech They have in this material. No other brand came close. I also got some socks and underwear, great quality. Great customer service even when I got a stain on my shirt. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really think the company is on to something. The design language is excellent and pretty consistent fit between colors/ products. However, I visited the storefront for the first time and the customer service was awful. Upon entering it took far longer than anticipated for the employees behind the counter to look up from their devices. I did not feel very welcome, nor did they seem eager to help me find some clothes. That said, the store is small but it was clean and they do have a decent selection of the essentials, however they were out of colors and sizes I was interested in. I hope on my next visit the customer service is a little better, as someone new to the brand. Excellent recital hall at Berklee . Superb acoustics and lighting Recently had such a great experience with stylist Vickie! I booked through Groupon and was nervous I\u2019d be treated differently but Vickie was amazing. She was so knowledgeable and kind. My hair came out beautiful and I will be returning ! I\u2019ve been coming here for a while now, and Vickie is my absolute go-to for haircuts! She always knows exactly what I need, even when I\u2019m not sure how to describe it. Whether I\u2019m looking for a trim or a fresh new style, she nails it every time! If you're looking for someone who truly understands hair and will make you look and feel amazing, book with Vickie. She\u2019s the best! Cannot recommend Vickie enough - I came in with an accidental rainbow head of hair following a series of unfortunate at-home attempts to dye my hair black (see before and after pictures). She worked her magic and absolutely saved the day; I left with a beautiful reddish brown color and a fresh trim. I will be coming back to her again and again :) I saw Vickie Villante for a colour correct/tone/low lights and was so happy! Vickie really reassured me and made me feel so comfortable and explained what was going on with the colour of my hair and what she was going to do to fix. It's tough going somewhere new for your hair and trusting they'll fix it, but she made the whole experience incredible and I couldn't be happier!!! Highly recommend Vicki at Michael Albor Salon back bay! I am very picky about who I let do my color and Vicki absolutely nails it every single time. Whether your are looking to do a balayage or highlights, I have done both with Vicki and she always takes the time to help me achieve the exact colour/shade I am going for!! She is also the absolute sweetest - always have the best experience. Went upon a recommendation and everything was delish. Alejandro gave amazing recommendations and he was very knowledgeable about every item in the menu and gave awesome tequila recommendation as well. Honestly loved it so much came here for lunch the second time and had more awesome food recommendations from another bartender Corey. We had reservations at 7pm on a Thursday night. Traffic was horrible so I called from the Uber to say we would be 10 minutes late. That was not a problem for them and she even changed my reservation time on Open Table for us to 15 minutes later.\n\nWe sat at the bar (our choice) and Alejandro took excellent care of us. The whole staff behind the bar were fantastic, as were the staff we met at the front door. The place is long and narrow and full of energy, which made for a higher noise volume. We loved the vibe.\n\nWe started with a lovely bottle of Alvarhino (on the glass list, but we bought the bottle).  We then ordered three different kinds of oysters;  the Island Creek being our favorite. We loved the little bottles of sauce that came with them. Great way to reduce sauce waste! We followed with the Red Snapper crudo special, the Tuna Tartare, and the Hamachi Crudo. We thought the tuna was way too salty. The Crudo special had excellent flavors, but a couple of the pieces of snapper were a little fishy. The Hamachi was plump and fresh but the lovely sauce was a bit overpowering for the fish. A little dip of sauce per bite was all you needed.\n\nA big flavor surprise was actually the Romanesco cauliflower dish. It was absolutely delicious! The mussels were also fabulous. We did not try a main as we were fully satiated from all of the fish dishes we had. If we lived in Boston, we would frequent this place. We recommend trying it out! Some of the best seafood I\u2019ve had in Boston. We came here for the oysters (which were excellent), but the rest of the plates were the standouts. The octopus was tender and had a delicious char. The Arctic char was juicy with a wonderfully crisp exterior.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy on the wallet (we spent $200 across 2 people). Even for the exquisite quality, I would argue that it\u2019s still slightly overpriced. But if you\u2019re looking for a seafood splurge this is a fantastic option. John was our bar tender and he was very friendly and informative. The drinks we got were their Negroni and the dune shark. Both were excellent and we\u2019d drink them again.\n\nWe also got oysters, salmon credo, ceviche and attic char. They all slapped. Very fresh and solid flavor. Our favorite was the Arctic char and oysters.\n\nWe will come back! Select Oyster Bar My Favorite Boston Gem & 100% Wine Queen Approved\n\nSelect Oyster Bar is, without a doubt, the best restaurant in Boston. Every visit reminds me why I love it\u2014the freshest seafood, a perfectly curated wine list, and an inviting atmosphere that makes you want to linger all day.\n\nThe menu is simply flawless. From pristine oysters to delicate crudos and beautifully crafted seafood dishes, every bite is perfection. And the wine selection? Impeccable\u2014thoughtfully chosen and always offering something exciting to elevate the meal.\n\nBut what truly makes Select special for me is John, the bartender\u2014he\u2019s a whole vibe. His energy, expertise, and effortless charm take the experience to another level. Whether he\u2019s mixing the perfect cocktail or recommending a wine that matches my mood, he always gets it right.\n\nYesterday, John lifted my spirits, and now I\u2019m already craving another visit because a few more glasses of 100% Wine Queen Approved sounds like the perfect plan. Decent food but not quite up to expectations.  The inside was a bit dark, not the nicest compared to other newbury street restaurants.  Our service was not great either \u2014 first our waitress tired to take our order about 15 seconds after we sat down, and also never refilled our water which is something i like to see.\n\nThe pho itself was okay, still enjoyable but did not have much beef and in my opinion would have been better priced at $15 than $20.  The spring rolls were good, i liked the sauce, I wish they put carrots and cucumbers or something else inside of them.\n\nOverall fine if you want pho and happen to be in the area, otherwise id say find some place better We decided to sit outside because there wasn't any airflow inside and it was hot. Even though there were high chairs available, they told us they didn't have any. I'm going to assume the waiter meant they couldn't be taken outside. I'm not sure why, but they didn't say.\n\nWe ordered the pho dac biet, chicken wings, and fresh summer rolls. Chicken wings were ok. The fresh rolls were packed with lettuce and it seemed like 1 vermicelli noodle (see pic). The pho was extremely bland and the meat was very tough. Not even close to being worth $26.\n\nOverall service was average, but the food was very lacking. They also added grat, which was stated for parties of 4 or more. Would not recommend and will not be returning. place is so good! went here for the first time and service was amazing. the mochi donut and smoothie is one of the best in new england area. the grilled pork tasted really good and is really soft. 10/10 would recommend the taro mochi donut and the tropical smoothie. this place needs more exposure. Nice little place on Newbury Street, we really liked the food here! We got some egg rolls, grilled pork with rice, chicken pho and meatball pho. Everything was very flavorful, quantities were good and service was good! Would recommended! Boston, please eat here and fall in love with Vietnamese food. This place has it. Great outdoor dining, and the freshest ingredients with the owners special take on his pho and really non-greasy fresh delicious tasty food Vietnamese food is renowned for its balance of flavors, freshness, and use of healthy ingredients. Check it out here. Get the Pho, grilled shrimp vermicelli. The shrimp were perfectly grilled and obviously the freshest you can get. No added sauces but just pure beautiful seafood flavor. Check this place out. Abe & Louie\u2019s has a great upscale vibe and solid service. I really enjoyed the scallops, perfectly seared, tender, and packed with flavor. Definitely one of the highlights of the meal. However, I was a bit disappointed with the oysters. For the price, I expected them to be larger and more premium in quality. They were fresh but just too small to justify the cost. Still, it\u2019s a nice spot for a special dinner, especially if you\u2019re going for the steak. Abe & Louie\u2019s is consistently phenomenal\u2014every time I come here, it\u2019s an unforgettable experience. The atmosphere is elegant yet welcoming, making it the perfect spot for a special occasion or just an incredible night out.\n\nThe service is absolutely top-notch, but I have to take a moment to personally thank Raul for delivering what can only be described as the best service a person can give. There truly aren\u2019t enough words to explain how exceptional he is. Attentive, professional, personable, and always going above and beyond\u2014Raul made the experience unparalleled.\n\nFrom the perfectly cooked steaks to the well-curated wine selection, everything at Abe & Louie\u2019s is executed with precision and excellence. The quality of the food is always outstanding, but what keeps us coming back time and time again is the exceptional service and welcoming environment.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the ultimate fine dining experience in Boston, Abe & Louie\u2019s is the place to go. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to have Raul as your server, you\u2019re in for an extraordinary evening. Highly recommend! I went to Abe Louis\u2019s  in Boston, Massachusetts to have a very nice dinner. They had many options. We had two seafood dinners and a very nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. The service was immaculate. The food was very good and the attention to detail was top-notch. I definitely give them five stars Actually, the place is a real treat. Our server is on top of things and awesomely organized. We had mushroom soup and it was salty, crab meat salty as well - we're talking sodium overload. The tips are good and the fish are even better, too. May be next time we can try a different dish. Overall, it was a nice experience. First time at Abe and Louie\u2019s.    It was a Team Dinner for the Boston Seafood Show.\n\nAmbience is amazing, very traditional feel which I enjoyed.\nService was excellent.\n\nBread basket was exceptional.\nThe Crab Cakes, Bacon, Beef Tartare were all great.     Steak was a tad underwhelming but delicious nonetheless.\n\nLook forward to going back. Amazing service, delicious food and great atmosphere. 10/10\u2b50\ufe0f\nOur server Brenda was awesome and made our dinner experience extra enjoyable!\nWe ordered oysters, tuna tartare, lobster roll, scallops and lobster dumplings.\nEverything was fantastic! This place doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nAlso extremely quick service. I went during Dine Out Boston and never offered that option. No problem I came to eat and enjoy great food.  The Clam Chowder Bread and Butter Coffee were on point the Rum and Coke drinks were great and then it fell off from there, the Potato Au Gratin was not good at all just bland wetness and the Seafood Cioppino good taste but overcooked the dessert meh.  I've been to this restaurant many times  and I'll go again but on that day they weren't running on all cylinders.  The staff is exceptionally good. Pretty fancy restaurant and well down for the lobster and chowder.\n\nPersonally, I find it a bit overpriced and very crowded. The parking is absolutely nightmare. However, great restaurant to try out in Boston on a date night.\n\nTips, you can order crab meat stuffed in lobster, apparently it\u2019s a hidden menu. Definitely impressed me lol The oysters were really good.  The lobster bisque was a little blend whereas the clam chowder was a little strong for our taste.  Likewise the lobster carbonara though there was plenty of lobster meat.  The service was very good.  Definitely worth a visit. Overall I thought the food was very salty.  It wasn\u2019t bad but I\u2019ve had better.  We drank like 2-3 bottles of water because of this.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and our waiter was fantastic.\n\nI was hoping the clam chowder would be better since is was supposedly rated one of the best but I guess everyone has different tastes\n\nWould I go back ?  Maybe maybe not since I feel there are so many other good restaurants. We were delivered the wrong burger. We investigated by opening the burger to realize it was a breakfast burger with an egg, but we totally touched it. Then watched it be delivered to the right table. I approached the host to send the server over. I asked her the policy regarding this and she responded saying that I didn\u2019t tell her that I touched it. Not the correct response. Dry rub wings were nuked. Not a good experience in a very cool pub in the Back Bay. Been here many times but the server (specifically) killed it. This is a prime spot that I would only go for the beer and watching some sporting event.\n\nGrabbed a brew and watched a game with a friend here and the vibes were immaculate. The beer worked wonders and made the burger taste pretty good. I think the burger was okay but not top quality.\n\nOverall, again, this spot is for the brews. Overall great experience here. The food was delicious, but the portion of fish for the fish & chips was small. The soda machine was broken and the beer we ordered was out, but  the food we ordered came out pretty quickly and tasted great. We had the cauliflower and steak appetizers, the cheese pizza, and the fish & chips. Went twice, first time they put us in the back where no one was, didn't pay any attention to us so we left. Second time we had a wonderful server, we sat outside, asked to switch in the heaters and they did. It was great! So service may be hit or miss but if it's good then the venue is wonderful The food is great\u2026. however our server was not. Greyish/blackish hair and a ponytail, slimmer woman. She had an attitude with my friends and I the ENTIRE time we were dining and honestly made it a miserable experience. Checked in on us one single time (we were there for about an hour and a half) and gave dirty looks to me, as well as my friends. Her attitude was completely different with other tables and when she talked to us she was beyond condescending and rude. We tried to flag her down several times and she ignored us completely despite seeing us and making eye contact and she cared more about gossiping with her coworker than checking in on guests. Also forgot one of our main dishes and played coy when we asked about it, and it took her ten minutes to get us a box for leftovers. Didn\u2019t even offer us a receipt and had a nasty attitude when we asked for it. Will never eat here again due to poor service. Would not recommend. I loved the ambiance and our server was absolutely lovely! The food was okay, we got the Kung Pao Cauliflower which was way too salty and the flavor was a bit weird. Sonsie had a lot of Asian-fusion inspired dishes which was definitely a little unexpected but I thoroughly enjoyed the duck confit! My friend and I both got espresso martinis which were very good. My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here and it was incredible. We kind of stumbled in while exploring the area and managed to get a table almost immediately despite it being a busy Saturday evening. The service and atmosphere were top notch, The menu options and pricing were very agreeable and the food was KILLER. This place is a (nearly) hidden gem that should NOT be ignored!! From the moment you walk in, you get greeted by the most welcoming staff ever! Everybody is so friendly, courteous, and very upbeat and positive. Then you get to taste the actual food and it is more than amazing. It is out of this world. I had the mushroom scallion pizza, my son had the Wagyu burger, and my boyfriend had the steak free, and they all raved about their food, saying the quality was amazing, the Food tasted amazing and very delicious and it was fresh, tender and very, very appetizing. If you\u2019re looking for an affordable and good tasting food restaurant in Boston, please check out this place. And do yourself a favor and you will not be let down!!!  It is literally the best pizza I\u2019ve ever tasted!!   And best service Amazing service, food, and ambiance! Bryce was a phenomenal server, we will absolutely be back! Avocado toast, eggs benny, and Belgian waffles were to die for! Mimosas and double macchiato was chefs kiss! Great atmosphere, pizza, and drinks. Calista was our server and she was super nice and helpful!! We will be returning. The noodles had a nice texture, and the flavors of the tomato soup were strong although they weren\u2019t my personal preference. The gyoza and scallion pancakes were crunchy and tasted good :) I had the Shoyu Ramen and it was absolutely delicious! The broth was very flavorful, the Chashu was tender and cooked to perfection, and the noodles complemented the broth perfectly. Also, the service was excellent and our server was very nice! Definitely would go back! Authentic Chinese noodles. Came here 2 times during my short trip to Boston and have several vegetarian options. Definitely recommended! Stumbled upon it by accident and the tomato beef noodles were delicious, they are Yunnan rice noodles, so don't expect Japanese style noodles, I see everyone complaining about it. I was fortunate enough not to have encountered the 20% gratuity like everyone else said, I think they may have changed it. Great choice if you don't want to make your way to Chinatown for some Asian food. Very solid tasty Ramen, dumplings and crab rangoons! Quite a tight space with a very cheap interior, but an excellent place for comfort food. The service was quite unnecessarily complicated, where they make you place your order online, then it goes straight to the kitchen, but you pay for everything at the very end, and not online. You order ramen on the website, but meat and all toppings need to be added separately. There is virtually no interaction with the staff, which I find weird. Overall, fast and tasty! I enjoyed the customizable aspect of GRECO's pita roll, with its various protein and sauce options. While flavorful, I found both the fries and the meat to be a little dry and not as tender as I would have preferred. It's also convenient that they have seating available in the store. Greco , Newbury St.\n\nQuick service, and a great budget meal on Newbury. Store is usually busy.\n\nPork and chicken skewers. You can also get some of the classic Greek foods as well.  Compact menu.  Greek donuts bathed in honey for dessert!\n\nMeats were fresh , nicely seasoned.\n\nSeating indoors and out. Very nutritious and high protein meal that doesn't overwhelm you. The beef patties were delicious, though wasn't what I expected, but I really enjoyed the zucchini chips and spicy feta! Would definitely re-order these sides again.\n\nThe place is a bit small, so it may not be ideal for larger groups (3+). Love this place, always my go to for fresh food on Newbury that tastes delicious. The zucchini chips are DIVINE. A must get when they are made fresh (some days you aren\u2019t as lucky but it\u2019s a risk worth taking). My favorite is the horiatiki salad with charred eggplant. The keftedes are so good. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Brussels sprouts, just to note, but truly you can\u2019t go wrong with Greco. Expensive for fast casual but so much better than so many other options on newbury This was my husband's and i first time here in Boston and we both were hungry and happened to see this spot and the food was awesome. We both had the chicken  Plate and it was perfectly seasoned!! The team here was very friendly and welcoming.. when we visit again  we will definitely be coming back!!! Oh and try their donuts not sure what they were called but my husband got some and he liked them .. thank you guys for the great first time experience!!! We were delivered the wrong burger.

We had \u201cbuy one get one free\u201d on Valentine\u2019s Day! Lucky! The waiter serves a good attitude but he is so busy that he can\u2019t help us anytime\u2026 Shake Shack is always a treat, but this super clean, well managed store has a great location and attitude! The easiest way to order on the touchpads to the right! The interface is very intuitive and easy to use. At the end, you take a number and leave phone number. They text you when food is ready. They bring it right to your table! I had my usual ShakBurger \ud83c\udf54 with crinkle fries! \ud83c\udf5f ! Food was perfect! Served hot and fast! The gentleman who brought my food was friendly and efficient! I sat in front with great people watching from big windows on Newbury Street! I could not have been happier with my lunch. Parking not easy, but near T! Really good food, but have to compliment the server JULIE!! She is amazing! Went above and beyond! We asked for so many things and she did everything with a smile!! One of the best service in Boston for sure What I disliked was it looks like more training is needed in the kitchen and value for money.  What the photos of how the burgers should look like is so different from the actual. It is bordering on false advertising, if not legally false advertising.  I  ordered Black truffle burger and there was hardly any truffle sauce nor fried onion rings.  So when it came, we looked at it a bit perolexed because all you could see is a bun and the burger peeking out, all limp and  pale.   I give it a 2* for that.   Even the person who brought it to the table wondered when she handed it to me and before I can say anything, she said \u201cwhere is everything\u201d and asked if she can bring it back to the kitchen. This person Yoshi, made the whole experience a 10*.  She had it corrected quickly and efficiciently, proper amount of Black truffle sauce and onion rings were added but that shouldn\u2019t have happened.    I also want to take this opportunity to comment her highly.  She was non-stop cleaning, fixing and checking in on customers that I felt I was in a full service restaurant. I could see her approaching other guests how they were doing and needed anything, something I never experienced in a Shake Shack.  Management, I ask that you please take note of her, Yoshi(I asked for her name) Really good quick burger at a fair price. Dirty Water Dough Company\n\nAn entire pie or by the slice. Dropped in for a quick bite on Newbury Street.\n\nMenus are on elevated screens. Nice interior. Fairly spacious. But if you\u2019re eating in for a slice , that wont take long.\n\nSandwiches and salads also available.\n\nTried the green monster. Nice and warm. First bite impression: Crispy crust\u2026warm cheese, pesto, tomatoes, mozzarella and Romano what a combo. Excellent. Not to salty, no weird artificial flavors.\n\nNothing dirty about this pizza!!\n\nBravo! Loved our time here! Felt like we were doing something distinctly Bostonian AND special! Staff behind the counter were so friendly and engaging and you could tell they were proud of their pizzas! It made the experience even more enjoyable! Cool spot with great service, but nothing special unfortunately. Crust was good but the sauce has little to no flavor and had to add garlic powder and parm to get a good taste out of it. Ceasar salad was pretty good. Good prices. Ordered the large half cheese/ sausage, peppers, onions pizza cause I needed leftovers for next day.... Absolutely delish!!! Not too salty or sweet, not greasy and a great price for NY style slice!   Friendly amazing service too, Highly recommend \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Coming from NJ/NYC area, this is the closest to a real \"pie\" that I've had in Boston! Really good.. it is exactly what we've been missing. Had a cheese pizza (aka Plain Pie in Jersey speak) everything, especially the dough made us feel like we were back in NJ... Staff was wonderful, made sure we had garlic, pepper flakes, etc to go... And their birch beer was so good, not too sweet. Can't wait to go back and try more. We were pleasantly surprised by the food here, which runs ahead of the star rating.\n\nThe oysters was fresh and delicious - some of the best I\u2019ve had in Boston. The fish sandwich was also great and the portioning of beer-battered hake is very generous.\n\nOur only knock is that the outdoor tables were poorly maintained. They were quite wobbly and needed to be switched out.\n\nIt\u2019s pricey (they quoted $55 for the lobster roll which seemed a bit outrageous) which is expected for this part of town, but definitely recommended for the great food. The first time coming here was on a Wednesday night, the atmosphere was very comfortable, the decor was modern and the lighting was perfect for a casual dine with friends, a date or a place for after work drinks. The service was great, the food was good but not amazing. I had the shrimp, tuna tartare, and the lobster roll (coated with butter) w fries on the side (didn't take a pic). I just had chardonnay for drinks. Would come again. We went on a Friday at 1pm so it wasn\u2019t too busy. The waitress was attentive. The oysters were good, we ordered ones from Maine and Nantucket. The ones for Maine were bigger as expected but overall the oysters were great.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything I can recommend to improve the restaurant, it would be to offer more toppings for the oyster, but I would come again for a quick bite. This undergroung oyster bar is a hidden jem I would never miss!!! What a suprise. The food was absolutely incredible, TOP quality oysters and raw bar, excellent wines, the place and music are great, and the best service from Jaqueline :)) What an absolute treat. Perfectly paced meal from the chilled oysters, fried clams to steak frite. Beautiful ambient whale theme shows a true love for the sea. Off the crowed street, the quiet and quaint restaurant had a bustling staff working toward an excellent dining experience. I would suggest an espresso machine to complete the experience. We went for our 5 year anniversary and had an incredible time. The food was absolutely amazing and the staff were wonderful. They made our day so special without us even really asking! Upgraded our seat and also gave us a cute parting gift as an anniversary present. 1000/10 recommend! This is my second time visiting this restaurant and I loved that they changed their menu every now and then! Everything was delicious, the ambiance was really nice, and the personnel were amazing, giving us recommendations when we needed them! We tried the wine here, which is really good, and we tried the octopus as our main dish! It was absolutely amazing! And all the entrees and salads were delicious too! A very cozy and warm atmosphere offering boutique Greek wines and innovative yet authentic cuisine. Exec Chef Jerry Pabla is an amazing curator and a great human being. All the staff members were extremely helpful and made our experience an unforgettable one! We will be back soon Service was excellent, food was tasty. highly recommended restaurant with atmosphere. Using maize as a restaurant theme is also very interesting. The seasoning of the king mushrooms as an appetizer is amazing, The octopus is chewy and the seasoning is a bit like Chinese bbq octopus (?) . Both entree were good. One was tomato and lamb pilaf? The other was beef noodles. \u8c03\u5473\u633a\u4e2d\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u559c\u6b22\u4e2d\u9910\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e0b Krasi, a Greek restaurant nestled in the bustling heart of the city, came highly recommended and certainly did not disappoint. From the moment we stepped inside, we were embraced by an ambiance that effortlessly blended modern chic with traditional Greek elements, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe value for money at Krasi is exceptional. Pricing is very reasonable, particularly given the quality of the dishes served. Each plate that arrived at our table was a visual delight and a culinary triumph, blending authentic Greek flavors with a contemporary twist that excited the palate.\n\nOur server, Jesus, exemplified first-rate service. His knowledge of the menu was impressive, and his recommendations were spot on. He skillfully guided us through the menu, suggesting dishes that complemented each other perfectly, enhancing our overall dining experience and making it both memorable and enjoyable.\n\nWe indulged in a variety of dishes, each prepared with care and precision. The flavors were bold, and the ingredients were fresh, showcasing the best of Greek cuisine. The portion sizes were generous, leaving us satisfied and eager to return.\n\nAdditionally, the cleanliness of the restaurant was notable, particularly the bathrooms, which were among the cleanest I\u2019ve encountered. This attention to detail in maintaining such clean facilities contributed greatly to the comfort and enjoyment of our visit.\n\nKrasi is more than just a dining destination; it\u2019s an experience that captures the essence of Greek hospitality and gastronomy. Whether you\u2019re a fan of Greek cuisine or looking to try it for the first time, Krasi is a must-visit restaurant that promises an unforgettable dining experience, complete with impeccable service and pristine facilities. Can we talk about the red wine sangria at Serafina's?\u2014WOW, it was delicious! I'm not sure what wine you use or what ingredients are in it, but I've yet to find anything that tops it. We stopped in for a late lunch on a surprisingly warm Saturday in March and enjoyed sitting in the outdoor patio area. The service was incredibly friendly too. I had the salad (not pictured) and mushroom risotto, which they kindly let me add an egg to for the brunch timeframe, and my fianc\u00e9 had a burger. I loved the chill atmosphere amid the hustle and bustle of Newbury Street. Prices were typical considering the location and that we got several drinks. Definitely give it a try if you get the chance! We were in town for the weekend and celebrated my birthday here for dinner. We were pleasantly surprised at what a nice experience this was! Drinks were great! We had the red sangria and expresso martini. Burrata appetizer was delicious and great to share for three. Bianca pizza, orchiette pasta and spinach ravioli were all delicious! A huge thank you to our wonderful server, Ricardo! He made our night even more special by taking the best care of us, taking photos for us, brining me cake (thank you!) and just being a pleasant, sweetheart! Thanks Ricardo! Until next time! Serafina was a cute little find! It was very homey and pleasant. Their margarita was delicious as well as their arancini starter. As for their vodka penne pasta which was $28, was not up to my expectations. Tasted like pasta I could make. Appreciated the portion size and was enough to take home. Serafina is a beautiful restaurant with amazing Italian dishes, wonderful service, and great atmosphere. This is an intimate spot for premium Italian food with quality ingredients and amazing flavour! Food is presented beautifully and it all tastes amazing. I highly recommend the black truffle pasta. You also can\u2019t go wrong with Margherita pizza. The service was also amazing, waiters checked up on at the right time and the manager even came to see how we were doing. The restaurant also isn\u2019t terribly loud so our group didn\u2019t have trouble hearing each other when talking at normal volumes. Highly recommend this spot!! This was a fantastic find in a busy neighborhood. They seated us quickly and the food portions were suitable to a satisfying lunch. The space was super clean and with quick friendly service. Nice experience. The food was delicious, and the presentation was beautiful. The only thing that was not enjoyable was the \u201choney\u201d served with the tea. I\u2019m not sure what it was, but it was not honey. The staff were nice and on point. The atmosphere was cozy and really captured the essence of a classic French restaurant. It\u2019s a great spot for a relaxing and enjoyable meal. We went to La Voile for Dine Out Boston and it was stellar. 3-course meal for $36 a person was a steal. Didn't love the risotto dish, but the beet goat cheese salad, corn chowder soup, duck and red meat dishes, and pear dessert were phenomenal. They even scraped the bread crumbs off our table in between courses which felt nice for some reason \ud83e\udd0c highly recommend for French cuisine on picturesque Newbury St! The service and environment were both very good. The food was fine, and the flavors were layered. I really liked the confit. The two desserts I tried, Napoleon and chocolate mousse, were both quite average. We dined last night and had a lovely visit before going to a show at the garden. Service was nice and attentive but not aggressive. Everything we ate was delicious! Escargot, mushroom soup, chicken, Dover sole all cooked perfectly. The waiter even deboned the sole table side! Will be back! phenomenal service, fantastic wine pairings. we went for resty week and i got the beet salad (meh. grass), duck confit (!!), and a strawberry shortcake thingy that was on the sweeter side (very sweet).\n\nGet the chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9 to start or, if you\u2019re morally inclined, the soup was great too.\n\nall in ~$40/pp prix fixe Finally dined indoors after many times enjoying their patio. Their decor is lovely, and everything is spaced out enough to keep groups from needing to talk over each other. The food is phenomenal. Great sake selection & starters. Their ramen is top notch. I was just as impressed with their udon. Working my way towards their other dishes slowly. Do not recommend.\nAgree with most of the comments.\nFood is so ordinary but wayyyyy overpriced.\nThat one small piece of fried pork chop is $22, just the pork chop and nothing else.\nUdon\u2019s chicken broth is decent but it was $24\nUrchin pasta is $34. It would be way better if they make the portion size of this dish half, and reduce the price, other wise the overall experience is unsatisfying.\nService is not horrible but also very meh. We asked the server why there\u2019s a chunk of random white stuff on the plate (looks like paint) and they just looked at it and said \u201cit was probably just corn starch\u201d and left. I was able to try a variety of dishes at this cute but deceivingly large restaurant: chicken kara-age,  shucked oysters,  sea urchin,  salad, fried tofu,  takoyaki, sushi pizza,  etc.  Each dish continually impressed me!  Even the most simplest dish, edamame,  was clearly of a premium quality.  One of my favorite dishes was the baked rice casserole, Itadaki Signature Doria,  as it was a new experience for me.   I was pleasantly surprised at the size of fish on the nigiris,  and was pleased with the amount of rice in the rolls. The service was perfect.  I would definitely come back and I am looking forward to bringing my young foodies (ages 8 and 10) to try this place out! Ramen and Sushi was good but a bit pricey  . I admit the taste was a lot closer to the real miso Ramen I ate in Japan  compared to other places in Boston :)\nGreat paintings This is a nice comfy restaurant with a calm ambience for a small group. The food I mostly order here is the Ramen noodles with veggies and broth. It is whole and content filling food. You can see the images down here and feel the same way. The matcha frappe was ok and it was mostly crushed ice and less matcha drink in it. Probably saving on the costs of the matcha. My friend ordered sweet corn fries and loved it. There are interesting dishes on the menu and for me the Ramen dish has become a comfort food at this restaurant irrespective of the price. The place has a range of Sakes' too. Umai is a sushi & Japanese cuisine spot located in the heart of Newbury Street, with a nice comfy interior and some spots in the windows aimed out towards the street for eating and viewing.\n\nThe staff were pretty welcoming and quick with service, ensuring that the food came out quick. The food was a bit on the expensive side for the portion, but is passable because it is located on Newbury Street.\n\nI got the lunch combo with spicy salmon and spicy california. It came served with miso soup and salad. Miso soup was pretty standard, and the salad had a nice dressing and was fresh. The spicy salmon was rolled nice, was fresh, and wasn't too fishy. The spicy california was a California roll with the spicy mayo on top, which was alright, the spicy mayo was good but nothing too outstanding.\n\nOverall, a good spot for sushi in Newbury Street, good for a chill lunch or casual date. Umai is our go-to sushi spot, and it never disappoints! The sushi here always hits the spot, especially the special makis, which we love ordering. The atmosphere and service are both excellent, making it a perfect choice for our date nights. We particularly enjoy sitting in the window seats, as it really enhances the overall experience. If you\u2019re looking for delicious sushi in a great setting, I highly recommend Umai! We ordered the bowls. Food was fresh, clean and rice perfect! Bowl portions were smaller than expected. Food was all great quality. Pictured is the Anago don. Umai was kind of maa-maa.\nService was decent enough, normal.\nFood wasn't bad, but not quite worth what was paid I feel. Presentation was nice.\nWindow seats were pretty nice with the lighting.\nThey did have quail egg, which was a nice surprise.\nFor sashimi, I recommend the sake )) Ordered two lunch set bentos! (Salmon Steak & Fried Chicken) Both were fresh and the portions generous! I especially liked the variety as it included a few pieces of sushi, a spring roll, and a fried dumpling as small additions to the bento. Service was fast and overall it was a great experience! My nephew asked for a sausage and English muffin.  They're so busy trying to charge you, but don't take direction well.  He received a piece of sausage in a bag with no English muffin. I had to get back in line and wait for them to toast it while the attendant complained in a good native language the entire time. They get me the wrong syrup and when I ask to change they just put the right one in the same cups this is how it look like and they can't even communicate properly He called me and my friend weird/no food there like treble survive like I am never coming back even if my mom makes me\nTerrible service Quick service, great treats, in and out. What more could you ask for in a Dunkin'? Excellent location, within easy walking distance from multiple hotels. By far the worst dunkin donuts , first the store was empty and no employee in the register someone was just in his phone doesn\u2019t care about customers, and then just give me a wrong drink Lobstah on a Roll is a must-visit for seafood lovers! Their lobster roll was absolutely incredible\u2014packed with fresh, sweet lobster meat, just the right amount of seasoning and a buttery soft bun. Easily one of the best I\u2019ve had in Boston!\n\nThe clam chowder had great flavor, but it could have been a bit warmer. That said, the overall experience was fantastic. The service was friendly and welcoming, making us feel right at home in the cutest quaint space.\n\nIf you\u2019re craving a top-tier lobster roll with excellent service, this is the place to go. I\u2019ll definitely be back! This place was great!  It's located on Newbury Street in the heart of lots of great shops, boutiques, and restaurants.   It's super casual. You walk in and seat yourself.  I was thoroughly impressed by the menu.. they had some really unique options on there like lobster ramen and they had a lot of non seafood choices as well such as cheesesteaks, chicken parm, pastas, burgers, and chicken sandwiches.   I ordered the clam chowder on a cold Boston day, it was delicious (some of the best I've ever had).  I also got the lobster grilled cheese, it was really good as well and came with fries.  My suggestion for the lobster grilled cheese is using a different cheese instead of cheddar (like a gouda or guyere) I feel like it would really elevate the sandwich (in my opinion).  Overall, great pick for a casual lunch -not fancy. High recommend this restaurant. Cozy and really yummyyyy. The staff is friendly and helpful. I order one Bostonian n one claw soup. Then when I ask for take away the claw soup, she refilled a whole bowl for me again \ud83d\ude0d definitely will back again and try more options at the store soon \ud83d\udc4d Lobstah on a roll is located in the heart of Newbury Street, with outdoor and indoor dining options.\n\nThe service was very good. They brought our food out in a timely manner and made sure our meal was to our perfection. They walked us through the menu and even helped us through with a discount we had gotten.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice. The outdoor dining has some umbrella overhangs to protect against the sun, though it does have a bit of a cramped space on the outdoor dining in the street.\n\nThe food is exceptional. I got the clam strips with fries, which were fried lightly and had a good seasoning on the fries. We also tried the lobster roll, which was ok for the price, but tasted really good. The clam chowder and lobster bisque was good as well. The clam chowder was a little thick but still smooth enough to taste great with crackers.\n\nOverall a wonderful place for a quick bite on newbury street. Really delicious food! I got the lobster grilled cheese and it comes with fries. It is made with sourdough bread and everything tasted very fresh. It\u2019s a rather small place so it may be hard to find seating during lunch rush but other than that it was amazing!! We finally decided to wait and it was so well worth it. The vegetarian ramen was incredibly flavorful, we added the egg inside and it was even more delicious. The bento box was great, salmon was salty but delicious. Very small place which explains why there\u2019s such a long wait - will definitely come again. No chicken options, only one vegetarian ramen option available. They do make a good ramen, with a deep broth that likely simmers for a couple of days. Hope they don't cut up Chasu extra topping meat.\n\nThe service is quick. I'm not sure if the ramen's that amazing to justify the long queue at the restaurant, but it is definitely good. Maybe the small size is what draws people in and sparks curiosity. It's been this way since I was in grad school, so at least six years now. I would\u2019ve come more often if it weren't for the long wait. Warning: this review maybe biased due to rain, cold weather and hunger.\n\nBlack garlic ramen was excellent. Broth 4.5/5 on umami scale. Noodles al dente. Soft boiled egg included. Oddly chashu (pork belly) was chopped up. I prefer sliced.\n\nOverall strong recommend.\n\n15min wait but worth it. Small inside. Service quick and friendly. Pretty good ramen! The broth is nice and warm and perfect for a cold day. There was a wait outside and it seemed like a common occurrence for the place. I waited about 20-30 min on a Saturday night at 6 pm ish. The service was speedy though! The ambiance of the place really stands out - the close quarters with the semi-open kitchen was really unique. Overall, a nice lunch or dinner if you\u2019re in the area and don\u2019t mind a wait. Decent ramen.\nBut portion is very small.\nBecause the store has limited seats, there\u2019s usually a line waiting for at least 30 min.\nBig group (4+) not recommended. Overall experience was just ok. We were hungry so we dropped by for a sandwich -- it cured our hunger but I wouldn't say it was amazingly tasty. Just average. Personally would pick Subway over this. I thought the concept was good and the food was ok but it was really nothing out of the ordinary.\nI ordered a Philly Cheesesteak and it was rather bland and the service was very slow; we waited almost 30 minutes for 5 subs, and even then our order came out in parts.\nIt's a good, affordable option in Newbury St but other than that, not very memorable. The sandwich shop recently opened a few months ago and they're pretty common in other parts of the country. They're new to Boston as far as I know and they're just as good as I remember them. The only issue is they have the dreaded Newbury tax and the sandwiches and add ons easily raise the price considerably.  They're worth checking out but definitely be aware of how much you're paying when you go. Cheap sandwiches that taste good. I think this is what you need to find in a sandwich shop. Like the sandwiches better than subway. I would highly recommend getting these sandwiches and consider catering if you have a large party, but don't want to spend a ton of money on the food.\n\nBuffalo Chicken sandwich - 5/5. Really good and I like the portion sizes and customizability. Tried their banh mi sandwich. It felt more like a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, but it was still enjoyable. The pickled veggies were good. Definitely a little overpriced, but in line with the pricing in Newbury. Went down to BB for a concert and found this place after the show. The staff was super friendly, so many drinks on the menu looked delicious but I went with the pineapple royale since it's not average Boston fare and it was fantastic. Again, so many food items I wanted to try, but I ordered the twin dragons and it was so flavorful, fresh and well made, not to mention the best sushi I've had, anywhere. Can't wait to go back. Absolutely recommend this place! Amazing food and drinks calamari was the best i ever had. Baby back ribs were so tender and came out flaming as well. Cozy atmosphere but the sad part is they were completely empty.. Really delicious!! My partner and I got the calamari as an appetizer as well as the pork belly ramen and shrimp ramen respectively. Server was attentive and pleasant. This was our second time dining here and both times were really good. Would totally recommend! Best sushi I have ever tasted!!! Restaurant looks nice and has good music that fits the style. The fish was as good as in Norway The service was ok .  We ordered drinks they were good.  The waitress was rushing us to finish , so we could order more drinks . (Because it was 45 minutes until closing.  )  They were also drinks made in blender with ice ,  So it was difficult . They had music , and a public  bathroom .  The parking on the street is impossible but they have a pricey parking garage across the street .  It\u2019s pricey and the portions are ok. La Neta on Newbury St. serves up some really tasty, authentic Mexican food. The free chips and salsa were a nice touch\u2014fresh and flavorful. I ordered the Al Pastor Quesadilla Sonoran-style, which was delicious, though the portion felt a bit small for the price. If you are hungry, I recommend the burrito or chilaquiles, which my friends got and made me slightly a little jealous!\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy and well-decorated\u2014think warm, inviting, and not overly flashy or \"Instagram-bait.\" I do wish they offered Mexican Coke, but their agua fresca was refreshing and well-made.\n\nHaving tried their sister restaurant, I do think their portion and food quality is worth the price, especially on Newbury St.\n\nWe came with a big group on a Sunday morning, and it wasn\u2019t too crowded, but I can imagine it gets packed (and maybe hard to find seating) on weekend nights. Overall, I\u2019d return and recommend for others to try. Exceptionally good gourmet tacos. Creative and delicious recipes and ingredients. It was bustling when we went on a Saturday night, with lots of happy people munching away and socializing with their friends. Free water would have been nice, but I understand their reluctance to add to their dish load--unless they are just trying to make more money. But I doubt that because the prices per taco were modest and excellent value given their quality. Lots of people seemed interested in getting fancy drinks from their expansive menu too. It was a very satisfying meal and I'm so glad I went. Great vibes and good service! La Neta is a small and cozy spot. The food was amazing and I like how the guac is not charged extra. However, I would not recommend the quesadilla. It was $16 compared to a $14 burrito yet the burrito seemed to be a substantially larger portion. Would recommend tacos or burritos. Also, free chips were a huge bonus too!! Stopped by La Neta after a long run with a big crew, and they were super accommodating, which we really appreciated. I had the carnitas burrito\u2014solid choice with good flavor\u2014and the salsa had a nice little kick to it. The fresh jamaica juice was refreshing and not overly sweet. Overall, a good experience and a spot I\u2019d definitely hit up again. Being from a border town ( El Paso, Tx) with exceptional food I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Boston. Great food, amazing service. I would love to go back to La Neta. Super cute tucked away spot off Newbury! It\u2019s a 53 year old classic establishment. We got lucky, walked in and snagged a table at the perfect time. Great classic Mexican food, salsa and chips. Tried mole for the first time! First time here and will definitely be coming back. Loved the vibe of this place and the music and drinks were great. Waiter was cool and really explained the menu very well and tried some really great options. Had Apps, dinner and dessert and was so happy with all the items. It's a little pricey but the quality of the food you cannot beat. Will be recommending this place to family and friends to come on by and get some awesome food! We were here on a Friday night, and the place was packed and pretty loud.  We had a table of 7, which was tight and kinda of in a way of passing to another room.  The food was fresh and tasty. The drinks were really great too.  The tuna in tuna  tacos was fantastic.  The flan was a little bland, but the churros were delicious. The guacamole was pretty great too. The flan did not have much flavor of caramel,  nor was it any sweet. This is the second time coming here. Love the decor and atmosphere of the place. It is loud and energetic, so it may be hard to have a quiet conversation with someone. I got the Chicken Enchiladas with mole sauce; love the sauce! Very cool speak easy entrance to the restaurant and it's bigger than it looks at first glance when you walk down to the reception area. Wasn\u2019t the best for the relatively high price.\n\nFood was just ok but atmosphere was good! Service was nice, and it sorta gives speakeasy vibes.\n\nDon\u2019t think I will come back here for Mexican food, plenty of great places elsewhere. But it\u2019s nice to come one time for the experience maybe I had a good experience at Red White Boneless Ramen! We tried the Roasted Miso Avocado and Sweet Chili Taco Sushi, and both were very flavorful. I really liked how they added a variety of sauces on top, which enhanced the taste and kept the sushi from feeling bland.\n\nFor the main dish, I had the Miso Ramen, which was decent. It was a bit on the spicier side for me, but overall, it was still good and had a nice depth of flavor.\n\nThe place itself is small and cozy, making for a comfortable dining experience. For a vegan restaurant, it\u2019s definitely a solid choice, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone looking for plant-based ramen and sushi options. The sushi rolls are a delightful combination of flavors and textures. The crispy fried onions add a satisfying crunch, while the sauces provide a balance of sweet and savory notes. The presentation is elegant, making it as visually appealing as it is delicious.\n\nThe ramen is equally impressive, with its rich and creamy broth that\u2019s full of flavor. The toppings, especially the corn and fresh sprouts, bring a nice contrast of sweetness and freshness. It\u2019s a comforting and hearty dish, perfect for a cozy meal. Both dishes showcase attention to detail and high-quality ingredients. This place was so good! My friend and I went for dinner. The line to order is awkward and backs everyone up out the front door and there are very few tables but the food is amazing. My friend is not vegan and really enjoyed her sushi and I had the ramen, which was delicious. Finding ramen that is both gluten free and vegan is almost impossible but they knocked out out of the park. The ramen was exceptionally good. We lived the Yuzu broth. The appetizer plate was not for us. If the restaurant is full it feels very busy. Great little place with friendly staff and a simple menu to choose from. My partner and I went for spicy mac & cheese, ramen, and spicy roll. All of the food was outstanding! We were lucky to arrive at just the right time, because as we left there was a massive queue outside. I'm not surprised that it's so popular - would definitely go again next time I'm in Boston! Good value Vietnamese food that also tastes great.\nThis place has been one of my go-to restaurants for Vietnamese delivery food. I usually go for the combination of their Pho Dac Biet and Bo Luc Lac which is grilled beef cooked with sweet sauce and veggies. Although the pho is good on its own, it tastes even better with a bit of sweet and savory meat on the side.  I recently tried their Indonesian fried rice, and for the price, the quality of the chicken cutlet on top of the fried rice was great. Everything was nicely seasoned and the chili sauce on the side added a little bit of a kick to it. Definitely recommend trying this place out if you\u2019re looking for a satisfying Vietnamese food experience. Great value, quick made to order and pleasant staff. Nice outdoor seating too. Chicken snd beef skewers and the Tom yum soup with shrimp was particularly delicious. Had the salmon curry and the rice was delicious not dry at all. 5/5! Fantastic, well coordinated service and the food was wonderful, each time I went. They offer a variety of spicy noodles and noodle soups, all of which are served steaming hot and delicious. Fried rice and noodles, although fried, were never greasy. As a person with a sensitive stomach, I got to really enjoy my food with no unpleasant consequences. Crab Rangoons are probably the best I've ever had! I have been here twice, but maybe I will drop by there again.\n\nLocated both downstairs and on a terrace, this restaurant offers both Thai and Vietnamese food. I sat on both down inside and outside sitting, and in both places service was good and fast. Downstairs the rest\n\nThai iced tea is a perfect option for summer as it's very refreshing and good. They have spicy food, so take a look into the menu and look for the spicy dishes. The menu has both lunch and dinner pricing, so if you want to save some bucks you should come on lunch time.\n\nI tried Tom Yum Pad Thai and chicken Panang Curry, both were awesome, tasty and spicy. Also the crunchy rolls and the banana dessert were really good and worth to try. The staff is really paying attention to every customer, refilling their glasses or asking if something is missing or wrong.\n\nI haven't tried Pho dishes, so maybe next time I will give them a try. If you're expecting authentic Vietnamese food, this is not the place for you.\n\nI thought this restaurant was authentic but was thrown off when I saw the menu included pad thai and red green curries. I guess it is a thai and vietnamese fusion restaurant?\n\nWe ordered the chicken vermicelli bowl and tom yum pad thai. Both dishes were on the smaller portion side and definitely lacking chicken. The flavor was ok...lots of fish sauce so hard to mess that up. We had a great experience especially when it came to their ceviche mixto\u2014easily a 10/10. The flavors were bright, fresh, and perfectly balanced, exactly what you\u2019d expect from great Peruvian ceviche. The patatas were also a standout, crispy and flavorful also a 10/10.\n\nHowever, while the seafood was generally solid, the restaurant seems to lean a bit away from traditional Peruvian flavors in some dishes. The grilled octopus (7/10), for example, was well-cooked but felt more like something from a Greek restaurant rather than a Peruvian spot. Similarly, the tuna (7/10) and octopus ceviches (6/10) lacked the same boldness that made the mixto shine and seemed weird.\n\nIf they doubled down on authentic Peruvian roots, especially with dishes like the ceviche mixto, this place could be truly exceptional. Still, if you\u2019re looking for fresh, well-prepared seafood, it\u2019s definitely worth a visit. 4.3/5 overall! Puro in Boston absolutely blew me away! From the moment I walked in, everything felt so thoughtfully curated\u2014from the stylish, cozy interior to the warm welcome at the door. But the true highlight of my night was the incredible service I received from Victoria. She was, hands down, one of the best servers I\u2019ve ever had. So friendly, so attentive, and just radiating positive energy the entire evening.\n\nShe took the time to walk us through the menu, made fantastic recommendations (which we LOVED), and checked in at just the right times\u2014never intrusive, always on point. You can tell she genuinely cares about making sure guests have an amazing experience.\n\nThe food? Absolutely phenomenal. Every dish was packed with flavor and beautifully presented\u2014it was almost too pretty to eat (almost!). Cocktails were equally impressive\u2014balanced, creative, and just the right kick.\n\nPuro has such a great vibe, whether you\u2019re out for a special night or just craving something delicious in a stylish spot. I left already planning my next visit\u2014and I\u2019m definitely requesting Victoria again. She made an already fantastic dinner feel truly special. Thank you, Victoria and the Puro team, for a perfect night out! Haven't been here in a while but their Taco Tuesdays are where it's at with low-priced delicious and nutritious tacos. My friend and I go to absolute town and I can't move when I'm done. Don't know about the other days of the week. Can't wait to go back. Oh and ah, sometimes they blast the reggaeton at Max volume. For me it\u2019s worth it but they could turn the knob down a little. Phenomenal Birthday Celebration at Puro Ceviche!\n\nI recently celebrated my birthday at Puro Ceviche with my girlfriends, and it was nothing short of amazing! From the moment we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the manager, Luis, who provided exceptional service throughout the night.\n\nWe went all out and ordered every single item on the menu, and let me tell you\u2014not one dish disappointed! Every plate was served hot, fresh, and delicious. In a group of ten, not a single person had a complaint or needed to send anything back.\n\nA special shoutout to Natasha, who surprised me and my girls with birthday shots, making the night even more memorable! The energy, the service, and the overall experience were top-notch. This was my third visit, and I can confidently say it won\u2019t be my last.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place with incredible food, outstanding service, and a great atmosphere, Puro Ceviche is the spot. Highly recommend!\n\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Delicious, fun lunch date after the MFA.  We had a mixto cerviche which was chock full of seafood & shrimp.  Instead of the Baja citrus style, this had a creamy sauce.  I am gluten free and they made us a batch of corn tortilla chips, otherwise the 4 sweet potato (?) chips that came with the dish would not have been enough.\n\nTHE RIBS!!!  OMG, I\u2019ll return just for these!  Succulent, all meat, fell off the bone.  The BBQ sauce was fantastic.\n\nChicken tacos were also tasty & had abundant filling.\n\nGreat service, our waiter was so nice. However, the food took quite a while to come considering we were the only customers at 3 pm on a weekday.\n\nParking on Newbury St is always challenging, just keep circling the area til you find something.   We recommend Puro! This place was pretty good. I got the breakfast Burrito with egg whites and it was very tasty & pleasantly surprised but the salsa inside as it made the burrito taste even better. The next item I had gotten was the  Milano panini with fries, it also had good tastiness to it, the fries were ok they were as good as they felt a little bland and they didn\u2019t have that crispy texture when you bite into it which was disappointing as they looked great. They also have a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls & lots of breakfast options which they serve all day which is phenomenal they do that. The service was excellent vey inviting and friendly. Would def recommend if your looking for something good to eat while you walk around newbury street. Lots of different options and a great menu! Definitely recommend if you are looking for a sandwich/panini/sub or wrap. Sweet potato fries are classic as well. Speedy and good prices for what you get. Great sandwich shop hidden in downtown Boston. They make some of the best omelets and sandwiches in the Newbury Street  and have excellent options for dinner. The service is fast and very friendly.\nI also enjoyed a delicious A\u00e7ai bowl! So refreshing! Iced coffee, healthy breakfast platter and the Santa Fe omelette.\nGreat works nice small courtyard in front to eat on and Newbury is always hopping so it\u2019s a great spot. The potatoes and bread were delicious and crispy, not too buttery and the eggs were soft. 5/5 It\u2019s fresh and yummy! Uber eats spend $2.95 get \ud83c\udf54 this is Newbury street,can not believe! Thank you so much! I have been here twice, but the experience and food/drinks were inconsistent.\n\nFirst time: I got the brown sugar boba milk, which was tasty. The boba was cooked well, sweet, and warm because it was fresh. I also got the chocolate and original smiley egg waffles. I liked the chocolate more because the original was a bit too dry. The gooey-ness and sweetness of the chocolate helped balance this.\n\nSecond time: It was busy this day, and both my drink (black sesame milk tea) and egg waffles (taro) took a super long time (~30 minutes). You can see the stark difference in the quality of the egg waffles the second time compared to the first. However, I liked the taro and would rank it second of the three flavors. The black sesame milk tea was pretty bad because the black sesame flavor was very subtle, and it felt like I was mostly drinking watered-down milk.\n\nAmbiance: There is some seating inside, but it can get quite crowded being on Newbury Street. One of the many options for bubble tea on Newbury st but it does standout with their egg waffles. The egg waffles looked very cute and the taste matched the look. They were very fluffy and had the right amount of chocolate to change the taste but not overpower. The bubble tea was pretty standard and nothing too exciting. The signature fruit tea I got had good tea flavor but all the different fruit flavors got lost in the jumble. We got one medium size brown sugar bubble tea (oat milk) I want it hot but staff told that this one can only do no ice; and one large size brown sugar bubble latte (oat milk).\nBubble is chewy and covered with brown sugar, for me the drink is too milky and sweet but my friend pretty likes it. Maybe I\u2019ll order iced one next time to balance the sweetness or try their tea specials.\n\nLatte one has stronger coffee flavor more than milk - truly a coffee drink! Could give it a try if you want less sweet and some caffeine.\n\nThere are seats indoors, a good place to take a rest while wandering along Newbury street. The best egg waffles (sometimes called egg puffs) in Boston! Large size, housed in an adorable egg carton, with multiple flavors (I like the chocolate best, but they also have taro and regular), and have an excellent texture. Bubble tea is also good! Went specifically for the egg waffles which they said they don\u2019t offer anymore. I got a milk tea 50% sugar with boba and it wasn\u2019t my favorite. There was only one employee during lunch managing all of the orders. This was my first time trying Raising Cane's and I really enjoyed it. I got a combo box with 4 tenders, fries and sauce, usually comes with coleslaw as well, but I'm not a big fan of 'slaw', so I got extra fries. The chicken was really delicate and flaky, almost like it was fresh. The fries were, just fries and the toast, didn't even pay attention to it, but it was fresh and crispy on one side, but not the other. The sauce was really good, I even dipped my fries in it and made them a little better. The place is all gold as well because it opened on the 28th of August, so Golden Birthday. Overall, the place was clean, it was busy, but I only waited about 5 minutes for my food and it was good. Overall 7/10, got Eric stamp of approval! i live in europe and i heard a lot about how good raising cane\u2019s was.. and they did not lie !! this is honestly the best fast food ever =D everything was good and i went there multiple times during my trip.\nplease open a raising cane\u2019s in France !!!! I have tried Cane\u2019s at Las Vegas. The decorations are completely different from this Boston Cane\u2019s. Both are about LOVE. The chicken tenders are for sure very tender and fresh. Their Cane\u2019s sauce is the best. Check if they give it to you. It\u2019s a must-have. The crinkle fries are average. The cole slaw is very smooth. The bread is very soft. Next time I\u2019ll try their chicken sandwich.\nStaff are efficient. It\u2019s extremely crowded but you get your food very fast.\n5 stars. It's pretty good food, and priced VERY well. It can be a bit messy to eat, but such is the nature of these things. The music was very loud, as was the restaurant as a whole, which detracted from the experience in my opinion. The price my lure me back here, and the food is good enough to make it worth it. Does anyone do chicken fingers better? This location is awesome because it celebrates Cane\u2019s 28th \u201cGolden Birthday!\u201d\n\nThe entire restaurant is gold!\n\nGold fingers anyone??? lol\u2026 same great taste, quality food, tasty sauce, fun vibe, and more! Jon and Molly, both bartenders, made my time as a solo diner after a looooong day at the conference center fun, connected, and simply divine. The food was absolutely incredible. Every bite was perfect! Gluten free cacio e pepe was just stunning. Whipped ricotta delish. Tiramisu to die for. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience. Thank you Jon and Molly! I had pretty high hopes for Faccia a Faccia. While the service was excellent \u2014 they went out of their way to accommodate our table\u2019s allergies and specific food needs \u2014 the food itself was underwhelming. It\u2019s disappointing, especially since the space has such a beautiful ambiance.\n\nThe appetizers were the better part of the meal, but even they fell short. The fried artichoke tasted more like generic crispy veggies than anything special. The burrata came with greens on top, which wasn\u2019t mentioned on the menu and honestly detracted from the flavor. The octopus was good, but the portion was tiny for the price.\n\nAs for the pastas, they were a letdown. The portions were small, and the texture was off\u2014 our table described them as \u201cgummy,\u201d likely from being overcooked. With 3 appetizers, 3 pastas, and two cocktails coming to over $300, it just didn\u2019t feel worth the splurge. Lovely ambiance and attentive service, but the food left me wanting more. No complaints here. As walk-ins, we were accommodated almost immediately. Our server Lisa was amazing from beginning to end and love that she knows who Totoro is. From the dim lights, to the clean, white walls, the food was the cherry on top. Every bite was like the first bite. Meaning I enjoyed my dish the entire time food was in my mouth. My husband me I will be returning to try out more delicious dishes. Faccia a Faccia exceeded all expectations. The cappittelli was absolutely delicious, and the waiter said it might take a while to come out, but it was just fine! The mozzarella sticks were crispy, salty, and amazing.\n\nOur waiter was attentive but not overbearing, and the ambiance was beautiful. The perfect amount of light. I'd definitely recommend this place for a fancy date night or a nice place to impress your parents. Absolutely fantastic! The mozzarella sticks, artichokes, pasta, and tiramisu were all incredible dishes, and my girlfriend is gluten-free, so the celiac-safe guarantee made this a real treat. Ok for a quick meal, feels relatively healthy and delicious! Overpriced I think for what you get, chicken can be a little dry. Highly suggest the fried cauliflower and eggplant side. We were once kicked out because we weren\u2019t ordering (we were waiting for another guest) when the restaurant was practically empty, which is quite absurd. But good food for the location Aceituna after dark : We recently booked what was advertised as a dining experience ($272 for four people), but unfortunately, the overall execution fell far short of expectations.\n\nThe event took place in a small room behind a curtain\u2014essentially a bar area inside what is otherwise a fast food establishment (aceituna grill). It lacked the ambiance and setting of a proper restaurant, which was surprising given the price point.\n\nSeating arrangements clearly prioritized fitting in as many guests as possible over providing comfort. Bar stools and small tables\u2014more suitable for children\u2014offered no cushioning and were made of hard wood, making the overall setup uncomfortable and cramped.\n\nOf the four or five appetizer options advertised, one of the main dishes\u2014meatballs\u2014was unavailable, leaving tuna and a selection of vegetarian options. The main course, lamb, was very difficult to cut even with a steak knife and was dry, as though it had either been overcooked or prepared in advance.\n\nWhile the bartender was attentive and professional, the waiter was slow and at times handed dishes directly to me to place on the table myself.\n\nTo make matters worse, a 21% service charge (18% tip and 3% kitchen fee) was automatically added to the bill. Despite this, the payment terminal still prompted for an additional tip without any clear indication that gratuity had already been included\u2014leaving guests at risk of tipping twice.\n\nAt this price, we expected a curated, comfortable, and professionally delivered dining experience. Unfortunately, what we received felt more like an overpriced, makeshift setup in an unconventional and ill-suited location. Finally managed to go to the Newbury Street location, big fan of the other ones already (Kendall location was my go-to since forever). Happy to say this met that already high bar in a super convenient location!\n\nDrinks were the standout for us with a nice view into Newbury. Especially on a nice summer day, would highly recommend! They had me at ACEITUNA!!! A great place for delicious Lebanese food!!! I recommend the Phoenician Fire bowl!!! Follow it up with their insane Baklava!!! Thank You Benji, Andrew and Madame for your warm hospitality!!! Great for a quick meal. Had the rice box with falafel, baba ganoush and cauliflower , plus pita bread. Atmosphere pretty nice, quite bright fluorescent lights but still good enough for a quick meal. Portion pretty decent sized, but it was quite pricey at over $16 Tip: Not ideal for getting large orders.\n\nVibrant spot and great for a quick sweet bite while perusing about.\n\nI've had much better Mochi donuts, but none as pricey. Nothing justifies the $4.75/donut; basic taste with minimal creativity. Don't spend 54.78 for a dozen donuts like I did, when there are much better options in the area. I havent had mochi doughnuts served warm, it was sort of like fried dough and very good.  I recommend black sesame flavor, it was delicious.\n\nThe location is a little weird being connected to a pho restaurant, so depending on how much staff is there it might take some waiting - we were a bit confused at first on ordering. Tiny place with few seatings. Shares space with another Pho restaurant. We went there closer the end of the day, but they had all the flavours still available.\nWe tried churro, glazed, and black sesame. Churro was ok but the other two were great. The softness of the donut was something different than the usual donuts. Really nicely cooked and tastes excellent. Excited to go again and try other flavours too. Tucked inside a pho place on Newbury, Mochi Dough is a reliable spot for mochi donuts.\n\nAfter a brunch nearby, I decided to treat myself to a half-dozen of these treats. Because of the location, the prices were slightly higher than other places in the city. However, when it comes to flavors, I found them to be rather basic overall. The donuts also lacked unique or extraordinary flavor combinations, but they still managed to shine with their airy and fluffy texture.\n\nAmong the flavors I chose, the strawberry and coconut stood out. Both had crunchy toppings - fruit cereal and shredded coconut, respectively - that added a pleasant contrast in textures.\n\nConsidering the limited dessert options in the area, Mochi Dough remains a decent choice for those seeking a quick dessert fix. Just keep in mind that for a wider range of unique flavors, you may need to explore other spots around the city. These donuts are of a heavier consistency than your traditional ones because they are made with rice flour. Very tasty, although I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call them \u201camazing.\u201c this is a counter and small seating area that is part of a larger restaurant. It\u2019s clean and everyone is friendly. I just had to ding them one star because the prices are outrageous. If they were large or intricately topped, maybe I could see paying four dollars apiece? But these are neither. I don\u2019t regret stopping in but won\u2019t be back. Food is ordered through a QR code which is nice, but restricted cash ordering. The drinks were delicious however!! Bookstore was super cute and has more than just books! Super crowded however, if you don't like people getting in front of you while viewing, I do not recommend. Definitely an amazing place though. Cool shop, thank goodness.  The food was almost good.  The eggs had shells in them, the steak was overcooked and super salty.  The potatoes had perfect flavor but were mushy.  The cold brew coffee was not strong at all.  The atmosphere was awesome.  The concept is really neat. Big book geek at a cafe shop that\u2019s also a book store?!? Yes please. Really liked this place and the food was also pretty good. They had 2 floors of books and little souvenirs you could buy and are pretty affordable for Newbury Street. Would recommend but also be ready to wait a little cuz the eating area is not very large and the cafe is popular. There is an option to order take out and then have the time to look at books in the store. I have never left a google review before, but i feel compelled to tell other people to not eat here. Was seated promptly. You have to order via QR code, and pay on it as well. No one to take your order. You have to pay before you receive anything. Ordered the pea flower Arnold Palmer. Was served a drink that only filled up the glass 3/4 of the way. It\u2019s not the amount of drink I\u2019m upset by, but just bizarre to serve a drink that looks like someone else drank out of it. Food came out quick. It was just bland. Ordered a couple apps and entrees. It came out all at the same time, which is fine, but we were left with no table space. The burrito is just ok, it was cold. No one came to clear the empty appetizer plates. No servers around to refill water. I\u2019ve worked in the restaurant industry for years, and I never complain about service, but in this case there was no service. With all of the available restaurants and cafes in Boston, this place is better left alone. Picture is how my drink was served. Best place for people who love books & food. The bookstore consisted of 2 floors, and there were plenty different types of books. Near the cashier on the 1st floor, there were recommended books and best seller books. They also put the sale book on 1st floor. I like the business-book spot on the 2nd floor.\nU could also find boston merchandise in the store. The place is small but was still packed on a Sunday night. The staff greeted everyone who came in. There are two self-ordering kiosks at the entrance, but you can also order at the counter.\n\nThe Rose Milk Tea with Dragon Fruit Boba ($7.75) was okay. I prefer 0% sugar to really taste the tea flavor, but I felt like this tasted too watered down with only a very subtle rose flavor. I liked the unique dragon fruit boba, though, which is only available on weekends. Price was a bit expensive. A good pick for tea quality and varie... Tea... :) staff was very nice, digital ordering in store, there's seating as well. Real milk in case you prefer that, oat milk or lactose free options too. Ten One Tea House is a boba spot that has multiple locations around the Boston area, with a large selection of fruit teas, slushes, and milk teas.\n\nWe came during the afternoon on a weekend, and the place was packed but not too overwhelming. There wasn't many staff on hand, but they were still working hard to get boba orders out quickly, and we got ours within 5-10 minutes.\n\nThe boba was pretty good, not too sweet or watery, with a good amount of boba that didn't overwhelm the tea. We tried both the brown sugar milk tea and the mango slush. I think the mango slush was the highlight, as the toppings it came with went really well with the drink.\n\nOverall, a great boba shop and place to visit on Newbury Street. i'm taiwanese and have always loved getting boba so I have pretty high expectations! still, the mango slush did not disappoint. you can't add brown sugar boba to some of the drinks so I opted for the \"blue pearls\" (seem to taste the same but maybe more firm? or less sweet) which you can add for an extra dollar. there were good chunks of mango and a good ratio of boba to the drink! (see picture for size difference) will definitely revisit if i'm in the area but kinda pricey (paid 8 for large) as a student so i wish there was a student discount. Bubble tea here is really good! Highly recommend milk green tea with tapioca, don\u2019t recommend the oat milk. It just doesn\u2019t taste as good. The tapioca pearls are so soft, sweet, and warm. They\u2019re delicious. The atmosphere gets 4/5 stars only because there were boxes everywhere and it wasn\u2019t the cutest. There are only self serve kiosks, two of them, so there was a line. I kind of miss talking to a cashier though! But overall pretty good experience. We came here on a Friday afternoon and it was kind of busy and there was also this woman ahead of us that complained about her order, so I completely understand our wait time. Service was kind and very pleasant! I got the dragon fruit bowl which was alright to me. I really enjoyed the quinoa included in it but felt like the bowl lacked flavor. I would say I prefer Pressed's bowl instead, though. My friends did get bottled juices and said they were really good, so 5 stars. I wouldn\u2019t serve this to my dogs.\nAcai bowl without any acai. Sour and nasty. All I could taste was the coconut. The berries were soggy and old. Anyone who knows what a\u00e7a\u00ed should taste like know a that this is not real a\u00e7a\u00ed!\nThe servers were so busy doing back of the house stuff that they could care less about the line.\nAll the bananas on the counter were old and brown.\nNot to mention the server bringing the granola without gloves was chewing and smacking her lips as her thumbs were touching the granola in the bucket!\nAnother server came out looked around and went back to the kitchen.\nI truly don\u2019t know why have this offering in the airport if the service is going to be like this.\nPeople rave about this place and truly the quality is just not there.\nSo for $14.75 thrown in the trash, I\u2019m never trying this place again! I love Mother Juice! They have plenty of delicious vegan options including baked goods. The service at this location has always been great! There are a few tables inside and a few outside in summer. We partnered with Mother Juice for several events and were impressed by their exceptional service\u2014quick communication, fresh products, and seamless execution. Highly recommend! This is a very nice juice shop on Newbury. Decent prices. Good service. Would visit again. I don\u2019t get it. The product quality is distinctly average to slightly above average for athletic wear. What\u2019s worse is inconsistent sizing across products that is not possible to comprehend until you try it on. This is amplified by really poor customer service that is punctuated with the type of attitude that you would more commonly find in a designer boutique. My husband and I have been coming here almost every year after he finishes the Boston Marathon. We love visiting this place after the race because hosting the Boston Marathon finishers here is a remarkable tribute to the community. Offering refreshments and recording the runners\u2019 final times on posters shows a generous spirit. I visited Boston recently and was excited to visit the store, but was quite underwhelmed. There was a very small selection of clothing in store, we couldn\u2019t find anyone that worked there and another guest had to tell us where the fitting room was. No one asked to help us the entire time we were in the store. So it was kind of a weird experience. Clothing is always nice and feels quality. We  visited the store on Friday august 25th in the afternoon. My husband and I were looking for running shoes. We walked in not knowing what to expect or anything about the store. The guy running the store would only speak to my husband and was only offering him shoes to try on. He completely disregarded me. I eventually asked to try a pair of shoes and his shock could not have been more obvious.\n\nIt was clear he took one look at me and decided I wasn\u2019t a runner type based on how I looked. He seemed to be very surprised to hear that I had run multiple races before. If you want to make a sale I would recommend treating your clientele better, especially when you don\u2019t know anything about them. Body shaming/judging isn\u2019t going to get you a loyal customer. I was a fan of Tracksmith but feel like they are losing sight of what made them fun and approachable\u2014the amateur runner ethos. On a recent trip to Boston, I was excited to finally visit the store and maybe be reinvigorated by the vibe and aura of the track house. Unfortunately, it was the opposite experience for me, with an unfriendly and unwelcoming staff and just an overall disappointing visit. Love my old gear, but don't think anything new will be ordered anytime soon. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Highly Recommend!\n\nTried this bubble tea spot on Newbury Street, and it did not disappoint! The place itself is small but super cute, perfect for a quick stop while strolling around. One thing to note\u2014they open at 11 AM, but when we went right at opening, the store wasn\u2019t quite ready until 11:30 AM. So, if you\u2019re planning to go early, maybe give it a little extra time to get the boba toppings to get ready.\n\nWe ordered a tea without the boba toppings, and honestly, it was amazing on its own! The flavors were perfectly balanced, not too sweet, and super refreshing. If you\u2019re a bubble tea lover (or even if you\u2019re not), definitely worth checking out. Will be back for sure! While I enjoyed Gong Cha's pearl milk tea, I was a little disappointed that the pearls were smaller than expected and not as chewy as I prefer. Gong Cha Newbury is the Newbury Street Franchise of the globally popular Gong Cha boba shops.\n\nOne feature that stands out is they sell bubble waffles with or without ice cream at this location, though it does tend to get on the more expensive side. They also have a deal to sell instant ramen, which I find a bit weird (ramen and boba?) but it doesn't bother me.\n\nThe boba is pretty standard with other locations, nothing that makes it different from other locations. The bubble waffles are good, though takes a long time to make. Ice cream is good as well. Not the best, pearls were soft and not chewy, had run out of red velvet powder couldn\u2019t get my hot drink but they did everything else comes hot also, so I picked one - which is made a a slushy and so didn\u2019t come hot - so I gave up on the hot\u2026. I used to love this place, but I was disappointed on my last visit. They used to have caffeine free milk flavor, but they don't anymore. There wasn't any Taro in stock. The mango flavor didn't taste like mango and tasted like brown tea. During my time in Boston, I made sure to stop by Central Perk Coffee Co. It\u2019s a charming, cozy caf\u00e9 with subtle nods to the TV show, all beautifully decorated. The service was warm and friendly, and I enjoyed a delicious matcha latte. There\u2019s also a great selection of Central Perk souvenirs, which I couldn't resist picking up. Whether you're a Friends fan or not, it\u2019s a lovely spot to relax with a drink and snack. I\u2019m already looking forward to my next visit the next time I\u2019m in Boston! I visited Central Perk Coffee Co. on Newbury Street for the first time today, and I was thoroughly impressed. The aesthetic of the place is stunning\u2014beautifully designed with an ultra-modern vibe that makes it a welcoming and stylish spot to enjoy a coffee.\n\nI had the pleasure of trying their soft chocolate chip cookies, and they were absolutely delicious\u2014warm, gooey, and perfectly sweet.\n\nI also ordered a hot vanilla latte with skim milk, and it was superb. The balance of flavors was just right, making it a delightful treat.\n\nAlthough we didn\u2019t stay to relax, as we were on the go, I had the opportunity to interact with Gloria, the cashier. Her customer service was exceptional\u2014friendly, efficient, and genuinely warm. It\u2019s clear she takes pride in her work and contributes significantly to the positive atmosphere at Central Perk.\n\nOverall, my experience at Central Perk Coffee Co. was fantastic.\n\nThe modern ambiance, delicious treats, and excellent customer service make it a standout spot.\n\nKeep up the great work, Gloria, and I look forward to returning for more! Huge fan of Friends here! Visited the place thinking it was going to be very similar to the set, let me tell you, it\u2019s not. Yes, it has a replica of the sofa on one of the walls and the dishes are named after characters from the show, that\u2019s it! Think of a Starbucks but with a Friends theme wall. Big disappointment, there\u2019s is no sofa in the middle, no coffee table, the coffee counter is not even an attempt of the one from the show, if are thinking about taking pictures of the place forget it! It does not look like the set at all!\nGood thing though: The merch they carry is cool and has a great design. Everyone here is so kind, especially Shak. He goes above and beyond what customers expect from a coffee shop. Just an absolute ray of sunshine! And this place is perfect for fans of Friends. So cute! I thought for sure it was gonna be all aesthetic and theme, and no good coffee but I was pleasantly surprised. I got an Egg Nog Latte which I recommend. The place is super cool inside and a ton of Friends themed stuff and Easter eggs etc. Definitely check it out if you\u2019re nearby. Cool place with good latte. Enjoyed hanging out. Only had latte and croissant. Enjoyed everything, but the croissant was average, in my opinion but the latte was good. Also, they had 50% off for capital one card members. Not sure it's a seasonal promotion. Eva and Rome were very helpful and kind and served me a delicious matcha and also answered an inquiry about my banking/debit cards. The cafe is also beautiful and had a very nice environment. Overall, I had a very good experience and it validated my choice to continue banking with Capital One! Thank you so much! I love the honey lavender latte and  roasted turkey.. very good when you need to do some work.  The staff is friendly. What a great location! New location and a new look. The customer service here is amazing. I am a multiple Capital One card holder and have never been in a Cafe. Visiting from Washington DC and walked in and was blown away at the space. Convenient coffee bar, plenty of work space, both private and in public, along with super friendly staff to help with your banking or financial needs. Definitely will be going back as my daughter is in University here. Capital One Caf\u00e9 just keeps hitting it out of the park, completely redefining the banking experience. I often come here just for the coffee, which is hands down 1000 times better than any Starbucks. They use Verve Coffee, which, if you know, is some of the best coffee you can get. The entire space is massive and beautifully designed, making it perfect for working, grabbing a snack, or just lounging comfortably. While they do offer banking services in the far left corner, the atmosphere is so inviting that it feels more like a high-end caf\u00e9 than a bank. It's a fantastic place to visit, whether for coffee or financial needs. A nice place gather your thoughts or practice photography. Beautiful pond with lotus flowers in the summer. Beautiful walk Staff behind the counter was to busy being on there phones. I told the girl I wanted to join with a black card membership. She handed me and told me to fill this out then download the app and fill that out never offering to show me around or tell me about the establishment or the membership or anything about the gym itself. Also the showers had empty shampoo bottles left in them and no sanitizer spray for the machines. For a workout before workday, the door is always open on time.\nConsidering the large number of people, the work-out room and locker room are clean and well maintained. And there is rarely an unreasonable wait for weights.\nAll credit goes to the staff. They are always friendly and courteous.\nWhile it doesn't adversely affect a workout, the lower level has low ceilings, and they didn't have a large budget for mirrors.\nStill a good workout experience at a great price I have been to planet fitness\u2019 across the country and this is one of the worst and potentially unsafe gym locations I have been to. Crowded, hot, and zero air flow makes the potential risk of overheating and passing out a much larger risk than it should be. There is no ventilation, and convection/ air flow  is required for sweat to actually evaporate and then cool your body safely. Industrial fans that move air should be standard, especially in a very busy gym that is a national chain.\n\nThere is a general lack of equipment, and the ceilings are not high enough to have a proper pull up bar or stair stepper.\n\nIt would get 1 star if I did not live down the street. 1. Modern weight training equipment.\n2. HydroMassage! Easy to book with little wait times.\n3. Cardio Cycling Bikes...but there could be a few more.\n4. Clean and well-maintained locker rooms with showers.\n5. Convenient location.\n6. Decent month rate/value for \"Preferred\" option. I got a good value out of my membership, and only cancelled because I moved to an area where there are no Planet Fitness locations. The membership fee and monthly cost was very fair, and the facility itself was well-equipped and regularly cleaned. I have no complaints at all! Fidelity is great! I\u2019m definitely making money (after learning a few lessons and making some mistakes here and there). My only issue in the last year was purchasing a foreign stock and I was charged a fee on the back end for that purchase, Fidelity noted there isn\u2019t a mechanism to warn you there\u2019s a fee for individual stocks. After a few phone calls I did get the fee reversed, so I think adding a warning / prompt about extra fees would be a great idea. Otherwise it\u2019s a great app and easy to use! I am using fidelity many years for my retirement accounts. Now I need to use the money for my closing day. They told me could not give me my money directly. will mail a check to my home address. I waited and waited, called many times, every time they asked me to wait 7-10 business day. I waited after 17 days, more than 10 business days now, they asked me to keep waiting. They did not want to give you tracking number of the mail. I said how your proof you mailed out, that is a big mount money. They said show on their website which day mailed. but no one told you from which branches mailed and which post office, tracking number. after that they said the reason is the post office delay. If you do not have tracking number, how you can say it is the post office wrong? I said you do not care customer, the manager said: right!! -------How crazy!!  I maybe lost the closing day. never ever see this kind of manage of server. They some how lost trades I requested then when questioned I was put on hold and eventually hung up on  over and over again and  this is with their so called premium service I\u2019m in the private client group. I use Fidelity\u2019s online bill pay. It\u2019s horrible. Usually they pay my bills late but recently they lost a direct payment for $1400 that was for Geico. Geico claimed they never received it. Fidelity could not provide me with any proof of payment. Now my car insurance is cancelled. Fidelity has given me the runaround. I plan on closing my Fidelity account because of this and will be filing a BBB complaint as well. Very poor customer service from Fidelity. Still not resolved. When it gets resolved I\u2019ll remove this review. I\u2019ve been with Fidelity for over 30 years and am immensely pleased both with how my accounts are handled and with the exceptional quality of the Fidelity staff - in particular, Meredith Lopez and her team. Excellent place if you're looking to watch European football in Boston. Home made food and friendly service. Good place to meet local football fans. Friendly atmosphere.  I watched Champions League Quarter Finals here. Thoroughly enjoyed it. The only Irish thing about this place seems to be the name.\nWas here when there were only a few small groups in the pub. Were right upfront at the bar but still had to wait a at least 30 minutes to order. Seemed like the bartender was too busy fixing up herself than serving costumers. Out of 3 drinks ordered we only received 2 and one of those 2 was wrong. When asked about this we only got the very unfriendly answer that \u201dwell that is what you got now\u201c.\nThe music is too loud for a pub and does not really fit (seems more fitting for a night club). Also there are weird breaks between every song like someone first manually has to choose the next song.\nCleanliness does not seem important at all. I will spare you on the details for the restrooms.\nCannot recommend. There are definitely better places in the area. Fun place to go and hang out. Very friendly staff. We had the wings and French fries and both were really good. Chard took very good care of us at the bar. Would def go back. Had a great time here two nights in a row! Great vibes and was surprised that we were able to find seating. Love when a bar has good seating options. Great Irish \u2618\ufe0f Bar in Back Bay with excellent, friendly service, strong pours and a nice variety of delicious pub food. The newly renovated space is long and narrow with high tops, booths and a second bar in the back (opened on busier evenings). A great place to watch the game or to celebrate a Red Sox win. Definitely recommend! Our waitress was very nice and eager to please. Its a fun time with a group, especially if you can get the stage seating. The prices for the bar snacks are reasonable. I had mozarella sticks for 5 dollars and we split things like pizza and buffalo wings. The music is loud enough without drowning out conversation and the service would great. Drink menu is varied and good as well. Check them out sometime. Lir is an Irish pub experience that you wouldn\u2019t want to miss. Also home to Boston Gooners who hold all the game screenings here. The place is huge with multiple levels. The bartenders are very courteous and they serve up some mean cocktails. The food selection is pretty impressive and they also have special menus throughout. Definitely worth the money spent. Excellent Irish Pub atmosphere. Lots of TVs. Great staff. Nice Irish pub with great clam chowder. Nice prices and many TV's for sports watching. Came here for the Women's World Cup game. Service is excellent and friendly and fast, and the drinks are fine -- decent (although not terribly extensive) beer list and my partner's mimosa was surprisingly strong. However, the food is pretty...terrible? The wings were soggy and too sweet, the s'mores waffle was just 10 jumbo marshmallows on top of a freezer waffle with some graham cracker dust and watery chocolate syrup, and the breakfast tots bowl was just okay -- a little bland and kind of small for $10. The coffee (which was a mistake to get, but the game was on at 11am!) was basically bitter water, and cost $3.87 to boot!\n\nOverall, we paid $45 after tax and tip for an app, two mediocre entrees, a beer, a mimosa, and a coffee. Not terribly expensive but for the quality...pretty bad. Service is great, though! And the ambiance for watching the game was excellent...so...stick with the drinking is my advice? a much needed space for our community, so happy to have Dani's in town. \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 food was delicious, drink menu was really creative, and staff was great despite serving a *very* big drag race crowd.\n\nmy one suggestion since i went to dani's first ever drag race night: let folks stay for untucked without paying the $10 cash cover. ;u; cover wasn't worth it when i just wanted to stay for untucked and then leave. had a great experience otherwise and i'll be back!! \ud83d\udc9e Shes perfection. She is grace. She is queen of the gays. Let me tell you about Haley. Haley is the best bartender at Dani\u2019s Queer Bar on Boylston, hands down! \ud83d\udc96 She\u2019s an absolute gem \u2014 not only is she a pro at mixing the perfect drink, but her warm, sparkling energy makes every visit feel like a cozy, safe space. Whether you\u2019re a first-timer or a regular, she makes you feel like family, always with a smile and a listening ear. Her vibes are top-tier and her presence lights up the room in the best way. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be served by Haley, you\u2019ll leave with your heart (and your glass) full. 10/10 would definitely recommend! A true queer bar queen! \ud83d\udc51 Fantastic, intimate yet spacious queer bar with amazing bartenders,  cute decor,  and excellent cocktails.  Not too loud, and a great music selection!  Handi- accessible.  Great place for after work drinks or a date, and an important addition to Boston. Go!! Too bad they feel they need to play women\u2019s anthems from 10-years ago (Britney, Kelly Clarkson, Rihanna etc.,) the ENTIRE time we were there. A little Kendrick Lamar \u201cNot Like Us\u201d or something recent or edgy would\u2019ve been nice. The kids can take it. I\u2019m 58 and my 62 year old wife thought these poor kids are listening to old music. But they listen to same old music that they all start singing along. Sweet Caroline anyone? I was very excited to go to Dani's and waited a while after it opened to avoid the long lines. I went on a Thursday night for Lady Gaga and the ambiance and vibes were great. However, when I went to order some drinks at the bar, and despite no one else trying to order drinks, I was ignored by the two bartenders. When one finally came over to serve me, she immediately accused me of not tipping the last time I ordered. One of my friends had ordered the first round but HAD tipped. She also said the other times I had come to Dani's I hadn't tipped, but this was my first time. I did finally get my drinks after that interaction but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure if I'll want to come back if I'll be accused of not tipping and given a cold shoulder."

    "reviews": "The pharmacy staff here are incredibly kind and extremely professional. They always go above and beyond to help with routine prescription logistics as well as immunization information and over the counter product advice. I go out of my way to go here when I need prescriptions and other pharmacy services. Manager Cleo\u2026. So I went in looking for a charger, waited in line and asked before my turn \u201cwere there any chargers?\u201d The manager stated he was working with another customer and i apologized. He then finishes with the customer and turns to me and says \u201chow can I help you?\u201d I repeat the question. He says NO. Behind him there is a wall full of chargers that he refuses to even turn around and look through, I then point out the charger , he calls someone to the front for the keys and I tell him I will be reaching out! He had the nastiest attitude and SAYS TO HIS EMPLOYEES \u201c you see this black girl, ridiculous\u201d what does race have to do with anything sir??? It was about a charger and you have to add race? I will be reaching out to headquarters MR. CLEO was clearly being prejudice. Terrible attitude and service from the two Eastern European clerks. Bought 2 packets of goldfish pretzel's yesterday15th December.\nBoth packets more than a month out of date and well stale.\nNot the first time cvs has sold me out of date products\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e I USE TO GET MY PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED THERE UNTILL A HOMELESS MAN GRABED MY BAG AND RAN OFF FROM THE STORE I COULDN'T BELEIVE IT EVERYONE SEEN IT HAPPENED THE STAFF SAID I SHOULD OF BEEN MORE PERCEPTIVE ONLY AFTER I CALLED THE POLICE IS WHEN I GOT AN APOLOGY FROM THE KID BEHIND THE CASH REGISTER. MANAGMENT DID NOT SEEM TO CARE AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I EVER GAVE THEM MY BUISNESS... I have been a patient of Dr. DeRosa for many years.  Best decision I ever made.  This practice is one of a kind. The front team is professional and helpful. I participate in their reward program and the front end team makes sure I don\u2019t miss any earned incentives. The nurses are spectacular, knowledgeable well trained professionals love having peels and Botox with them. I highly recommend Dr. DeRosa and her team. They are also all happy and like their jobs. The entire staff was amazing and made the experience so easy and stress free. I had researched the procedure for the last three years visiting many plastic surgeons in and out of state but never felt comfortable enough to move forward. This is a big decision and I had to feel confident in my surgeon. The moment I met Dr DeRosa I knew she was the right surgeon for my procedure. Dr DeRosa is kind, patient, professional, board certified, knowledgeable, compassionate, you can tell she loves what she does.  I\u2019m so happy with my results! I received a partial facelift and a chin implant. With plans of one more procedure in the coming months.\nThank you DeRosa Center! Excellent experience here! The staff is wonderful very knowledgeable and helpful. The office is very clean. Dr.DeRosa is absolutely wonderful to work with. You get treated like royalty here. I had a procedure done under anesthesia and it was a great experience from start to finish. There are two offices one in Boston and one in Palm Beach Florida. I would definitely go back and get a facial next. I recently visited the Boston location and was greeted with kind staff and a welcoming environment. I do my research and I'm realistic about what to expect. The consult was great, educational, factual and provided everything I needed to know to make my decision. I was able to schedule my treatment that following Monday and was pleased with the process from beginning to end. Ida is a true professional in the sense that it made my treatments feel pain free. Thank you again for everything and excited in continuing to come for other treatments. I got a rhinoplasty from Dr DeRosa on March 1, 2021. All I wanted was my profile straightened and to look \"softer.\" She operated and straightened my side profile and we did not choose to do anything else to my nose. When the cast came off, and I was able to touch and examine my face, I noticed there was a small but noticeable bump on the right side of my bridge. At my first follow up, she told me to do these pressing exercises to combat swelling and I did them very diligently. However, no amount of little exercises did anything to settle this bump. I visited Dr DeRosa maybe 4-5 times over the course of the next two years, and she was a bit flippant about this bump, even though I was concerned. She kept telling me how great it looked, and while I tried to focus on just the side profile, and not the fact that I now looked uneven from the front, I was very upset and disappointed about my nose. She told me the bump was probably cartilage and that she would be able to do a needle scraping procedure. I scheduled the procedure for April 2023 and then canceled it the day before. I canceled because I consulted three other plastic surgeons who all agree that the bump is not cartilage, it is bone. It is of utmost importance to note that they each mentioned the bump is the result of an unnecessarily aggressive surgery. I will absolutely have to have a revision in order to fix this; there is no alternative simple solution. There was also a review where another patient had the same issue and decided to do the needling procedure. She said it was painful and it did absolutely nothing to fix the issue. That really solidified my decision to not do it. It's not that I don't understand that there are risks to every surgery and that every surgery is a gamble; however, this seems like it was completely avoidable and I really think she should have at the very least acknowledged that this is not the way it should have turned out. She didn't even take \"after\" pictures of me and now I understand why. She is not proud of the work.\nI am a full time bartender and the other night I had to cut off a few intoxicated customers. One of the women decided to personally insult me and told me I \"need to get a nose job.\" This was extremely hurtful because not only have I already had a nose job, I have always been self conscious about my nose and I thought the surgery would help. I thought I would be able to accept this after 4 years, but the surgery hasn't done anything to make me feel more confident and I continue to be self conscious in daily life. I actually hate pictures of myself now, where I used to like seeing my face from the front. I paid over $10k for this surgery and it should have been done with excellence; I'm not looking for perfection. I will never be returning for any sort of procedure. Capsule is wonderful, i used to go to Walgreeens but to set for delivery was hard and I went days missing my medication. Capsule let's you choose your time spot. The people who deliver are wonderful and when you call they are very very helpful. Would like to share my experience with my particular situation,  I just  been struggling with diabetes for a short time  is new to me' & overwhelming, that can't be said to opting digital  blood glucose monitor it was stremly difficult' & stressfu  I just reached out to capsule  not spectin a eny  positive results but I was surprise when it was approve & redy for delivery,  if you have requested any  medical device & have been denied give them a shot Capsule is wonderful! Responsive to questions, on time for deliveries and great follow-up. Honestly the best and most accessible pharmacy I've ever found. They are kind. They go above and beyond because they care about their patients. I'll never forget today. Our driver masked cleaned their phone to protect my mom who is got heart failure and me who is also immune compromised. Not only are they accessible physically but for autistic people they are also accessible because they allow texting for communication! Literally life saving to be able to text your pharmacy as an Autistic person communicating in person and on the phone can literally make me ill and take my whole day because of anxiety So being able to communicate through text has been amazing. I really hope they never change because they are so much better than any other pharmacy. Pharmacies that I might add have become completely unaccessible because of COVID and non-masking employees as well as people who come in the store. So having a pharmacy that can deliver as well as text goes above and beyond for accessibility. Honestly I hope more pharmacies start following the methods of capsule because y'all are literally the best. Editing to add: I asked Capsule to transfer my prescriptions to CVS, and they transferred the wrong dose of a medication I\u2019ve been filling with them for several years. When I reached out to ask that this be fixed, I received \u201cwe apologize for the inconvenience.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been using this service for three years and it used to be reliable, but lately I\u2019ve been experiencing late deliveries and carriers leaving prescriptions on my porch without contacting me. Capsule has been unresponsive to my feedback on these issues. I will be switching pharmacies. Everyone is friendly, It\u2019s  clean and welcoming I was very pleased with my experience there. I had the privilege of receiving care from the amazing staff at Lifestance Mental Health, and I can't speak highly enough of their professionalism, compassion, and dedication, especially Stephanie and Dr. Naylon.\n\nFrom the moment I had the very first appointment, I felt welcomed and understood. The staff members were not only highly trained in their respective fields but also exhibited a level of empathy that made me feel comfortable sharing my thoughts and concerns. They listened attentively, provided valuable insights, and made me feel genuinely heard.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Lifestance. I saw a provider here after verifying with the practice and my insurance that they were in-network with my insurance. I had met my deductible and my out-of-pocket maximum for the year, and therefore, should not have been charged anything for the appointment. Insurance also confirmed they paid for the full amount of the appointment since I had met my deductible and out-of-pocket maximum. However, I still received a bill of ~$100 from LifeStance. I called and they claimed this was my co-pay: however, I met my out-of-pocket maximum for the year, so therefore, should not have a co-pay. I called LifeStance to look into it and they said they would but I have not heard back since and still have the charge on my card. Obviously there are a lot of practitioners here, so this review only applies to mine, but I did not have a good experience with LifeStance. My practitioner did not seem to care (or even be listening) during our first two sessions regarding symptoms. In fact, the two hours we were supposed to have ended up only being about 30 minutes (and I/insurance still paid as though it was two actual sessions). She went completely off the test and rattled off some basic your grades are good so you\u2019re fine response. Went to another psych who immediately disagreed with my initial eval. I would recommend looking somewhere else, or at least researching your specific practitioner at LifeStance beforehand! The care I've received here has been fine - I'd probably give it four stars - but as others have said, the fees are ridiculous. FUN FACT! They just updated their cancellation fees so that as of 4/01/2021 they have nearly doubled. Another fun fact! If you come here for medication management, as I do, and you need a prescription refilled outside of your appointment, you'll be charged $50. Fifty dollars for someone to take two minutes and press a couple buttons on a computer. I have seen a lot of psychiatrists and never been charged for this. Ever. I like the provider I work with but will probably take my business elsewhere because these fees are unethical. Using them was kind of a nightmare. I had appointments rescheduled 4 times, all with less than 48 hours notice (one with less than 2 hours notice). Each time I was rescheduled I had to fill out the same paperwork all over again.\n\nThere seems to be little to no communication between their branches, so when they had to move me to their Lynnfield office for one appointment I had to recreate my account and all my information went missing again. I was later told this had been fixed and the 2 profiles merged, which apparently wasn't the case. The person I spoke to in Lynnfield (who was wonderful) did not get any of the paperwork I filled in (again) and had no records of me receiving testing from LifeStance earlier that same week so we spent most of the appointment having me provide the same information I'd already filled out four times on the same questionnaire.\n\nOverall this place added so much extra stress to my life I feel like I would have been better off not seeking treatment at all. Dr Doherty is amazing, his staff are friendly and knowledgeable. I trust Dr Doherty 100%, I\u2019ve been coming here for years and tell my friends to never go anywhere else! I have been going to the Boston Center for Facial Rejuvenation for 15 years and I couldn't be happier with the results. I started in my forties and I just turned sixty years old. I visit Dr. Miller every 3 months for botox injections. Since my very first treatment the lines on my forehead and around my eyes are gone! I love these treatments! I have had several laser procedures over the years including Clear and Brilliant, Profound and  Endymed. The results were amazing! I also had ThermiTight with mini liposuction under my chin.

I have been a patient of Boston Center for Facial Rejuvination for over ten years.  I have been a patient of Dr. Miller's and have had the best botox injections and an upper Blepharoplasty.

I trust him and everyone at the practice is best in class.  I highly reccomend him and his practice. My first connection with the practice was at Time Out Boston where we met the doctors over drinks!  How fun!!! They are so approachable and passionate.

As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by Jill who was super kind. She walked me through the necessary paperwork with ease, making the entire process feel seamless and stress-free. I worked with Michele for my Diamond Glow facial, who was a delight. She made sure to explain every step of the facial process. The facial itself left my skin feeling not only refreshed but glowing and perfectly snatched. Michele took the time to provide personalized recommendations for my skin based on its needs and my routine. She was thorough in answering all my questions and ensured I felt completely cared for throughout the entire experience. I highly recommend SkinMD to anyone looking for top-notch service and amazing results! I had an amazing experience during my consultation! Caitlin at the front desk was absolutely wonderful, so kind, professional, and welcoming. She made the check-in process seamless and went above and beyond to help me find the perfect skincare products for my needs. She took the time to explain everything, let me try samples, and answered all my questions with patience and a genuine smile. I ended up buying the products she suggested, so excited to try them! The doctor I met with was also extremely helpful, offering thoughtful advice without any pressure to make a decision. The entire experience was so positive, and I truly appreciate the warm and professional care I received. Highly recommend! I love this place! Megan always goes out of her way to accommodate my appointments since my schedule is always busy. Always happy and professional providing a red carpet service. Overall, Sarah's team is great! They always introduce me to new services or products that they think would be beneficial to me. No pressure to buy just focused on my benefits. I went in last Thursday to get lip filler and the entire experience was phenomenal! Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Rachael was my injector and she was fabulous. I was a little nervous but Rachael was professional, reassuring and answered all my questions - and overall she just made me feel really comfortable! I\u2019m absolutely thrilled with the outcome of my lips and definitely anticipate returning for more!!! I\u2019ve been going to Skin MD on Newbury street for a year now and have only had great experiences. The staff are always warm and welcoming and always willing to accommodate last minute appointment changes. Jordan and Michele are amazing! They\u2019re both very knowledgeable and attentive to your needs and desired results! Nadia is a fabulous aesthetic nurse - I refuse to see anyone else! I highly recommend this med spa if you\u2019re new to Boston or in search for quality services. Lady M Boston is hands down my go-to for the best cake in the city. I\u2019ve visited multiple times, and the quality is always incredible. Especially their Mille Cr\u00eapes cakes, which are light, flavorful, and totally addictive. When I can\u2019t make it in person, I\u2019ll order on DoorDash to satisfy the craving. Whether it\u2019s a special occasion or just a sweet treat, Lady M never disappoints :) Newbury St location is a takeout only, we bought a cake for my daughter\u2019s bd here and we were surprised how smooth it was, we ordered the Crepe Mille style. I\u2019ve never had this kind of cake, wow  the layers melt in your mouth \u2026 we bought the strawberry matcha and the crepes are made to perfection as they\u2019re soft, moist and chewy and packed with a beautiful bag as well as a plastic knife. Amazing cake and experience\u2026 I definitely buy it again!!!!!\nI gave them 4 stars because of the customer service, they didn\u2019t have a friendly attitude. The crepes of this cake restaurant from NY did impress me a lot, and the Signature Mille Crepe, Green Tea Mille Crepe, and Strawberry Mille Crepe I ordered would definitely make me become a loyal customer.\n\n#AmazingCrepesFromNY Such a cute place!! I was walking by and the place caught my eye. The cake and treats looked exquisite. I was a little hesitant after seeing the price but am so glad I ended up getting it!! The employee recommended the pistachio cake and my goodness\u2026 what a treat. It was excellent!! I would highly recommend it, especially for special occasions. The cake had great flavor and texture. Awesome place in the Newbury area. Their cakes are so full of flavors yet so light. The place is always busy but service is very fast - you won\u2019t have to wait for more than 5 minutes. Had the pistachio, tiramisu and the checkers - the first 2 were especially good. This bank not is open, I was so far, and arrived here, and is closed \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c Albert was patient and helpful. He walked me through the process of opening a new line and keeping my old phone number. He gave me accurate quotes for the different plans and phones. The woman who checked me in was also very helpful and knowledgeable. I would recommend this store -especially these two staff. Frank the manager fixed ALL issues with my account that 611 was unable to fix in hours, days and in one instance years-in under 40 minutes! I explained that I am  technically challenged and then watched him work\u2014 organized, calm, resourceful and creatively applying his problem solving skills. I was overwhelmed, relieved, and very grateful!! This T-Mobile store is not just for sales they are available for customer support- thank you Frank and thank the rest of the staff!!! I had a great experience with Carmelot. I went in for a new screen protector as well as some questions regarding my insurance plan for one of my devices. He provided me with great customer service and has great knowledge of T-Mobile, their products, and the resources that you can utilize outside of the store to make your experience run smoothly. Thanks again!! I took in a phone I bought off ebay and it was locked. My current phone wasn't charging and I thought that it was going to cost me.  The guys at the store cleaned a lot of dirt from the charger port and saved me about 300 bucks. Awesome people. I got a new phone today with Carmelot. I had the best service with him. He is very kind, attentive, and paciente. He also helped me transfer my old phone to my new phone! He is truly amazing and goes above and beyond! I would recommend him to anyone. He was able to resolve my needs! Thank you so much Carmelo you\u2019re amazing! This review is long over due! I brought my almost brand new Rolex watch in for band resizing. The sales lady took my watch into the back room, after I had to request she used a jewelry tray to carry it. She came out after a period of time with my watch band adjusted. She was very unfriendly by the way, it really made me feel uncomfortable especially as it was my first contact with the store. A weeks later, when I took my Rolex out (of its protective bag) to wear for the first time since band adjustment, I noticed a scratch on one side of the watch.\n\nI went to the store, spoke to Nancy the manager who made the matter worse. She was rude, arrogant and accused me of bringing in a scratched watch to her store. It\u2019s obvious the same sales girl scratched my watch while she was down the back room resizing my watch herself instead of a watch maker. This place is disgraceful and mistreat customer\u2019s expensive merchandise. Sadly, there is no after service when issues occur. I do not trust or recommend this place to anyone. Brought three watches for repair, two vintage and one modern. Great experience all around. Estimates were quick, and great communication through the whole process. Had a great experience in the Wellesley store. Picked up a Tudor at a great price with the help of Alex. Alex was really nice and helpful and didn\u2019t make me feel any pressure to purchase anything. Looking forward to buying more pieces! Always such a pleasure to work with Nancy Haas when shopping at LB&G. Shopping for jewelry can be a bit overwhelming with the endless options and price ranges but Nancy is a great coach is offering ideas and always provides reassurance on my purchase whether it is a big or small item. She is such a treat to do business with and I love how she presents the Wellesley store - always beautiful and inviting.  Highly, highly recommend. Adrienne Cofield at the Wellesley store is incredibly attentive and helpful.  I have a bracelet that I treasure which I bring into the store twice a year to be checked out. Adrienne examines each link carefully and makes thoughtful suggestions about repairs that will extend its life.  Thank you Adrienne! I have been a collector of rare books for 3 decades and have never been in a shop with such fine employees. I brought my 20 yo son who had never been in a similar setting and they immediately attended to him and helped him to feel comfortable and appreciated. While they are not the largest antiquarian bookstore the volumes they own are carefully curated and chosen for people with budgets from $50 to $50,000. I have no other relationship to them except as a customer and get no discount for my opinion (I wish!). Much luck to them. Ask to see the Picasso miniature!! Jim I had a wonderful time at Bromer Gallery.  Magnificent collection of books, art, and educational opportunities for the entire family.  My artwork is so professionally placed and attended.  Thank you for the opportunity to present: An Artist's Reflections on African-American Life, Culture, and Trials Very unique bookstore with a lot of first edition copies. I found a Pablo Neruda book that I really wanted to own, but it was $1,350. Lovely little gallery! It's small but I could spend hours perusing through the collection. Their tiny books are unlike any others I've seen before. Highly recommend! The best little store! The friendliest people willing to help and share their knowledge. I had a great time. It\u2019s part bookstore part museum/gallery. The worst financial institution to have business! Stay away from them. absolutely impossible to get anyone on the phone from Merrill. Incompetent, careless.  I asked to deposit checks into my account and verify everything was ok to do that.  They confirmed everything was okay and told me to endorse the checks.  After they were all endorsed they told me they wouldn't deposit them. Now I am walking around with endorsed checks while opening an account at another bank.\n\nStay away from this branch! I have been using citizens for decades and have had few problems, but the three or four times I've used this branch they have made major errors DONT USE THE ATM. I am a longtime citizens customer, made a ATM deposit at this branch shortly after closing and the ATM shut off mid transaction while attempting to deposit 3 checks (Totalling over $450). The transaction wasn't credited to the account so I called to make a claim and was assured the checks would be found and deposited and the bank issued a temporary credit. Now approx 5 weeks later I receive notice that the bank somehow \"can't find\" the checks and they are taking back the money originally credited for the transaction. Every Friday, unfailingly, there is a line out the door.   I was so frustrated today that I jumped out of line and asked the manager and another woman just sitting in her office to put another teller on duty.  There is no sense of urgency or concern for the customer's time.  If I didn't need to deposit my check (which the ATM spit out 3 times) into this particular  checking account, I would have gone next door to TD Bank.  It's time to close my Citizens account which can only be done when I have ample time on my hands because there is always a long wait! I went to close the account with citizens there (Copley branch) and to take out all my money in a form of certified check. They failed to inform me that there was a pending transaction on the account (a transaction that appeared as complete on my end) so technically, account wasn't closed and I got hit with service fees for two months for having an account open without money on it. Also, two letters notifying me of these fees came almost together, after two months. I went to Tremont St location trying to get help but they said there was nothing they could do to help, so I just paid all my fees and hope this is my last interaction and transaction with this most unhelpful, not caring about small costumers, bank. As a whole, CItizen's Bank is meh - but usually you can count on reasonably friendly tellers and staff. However, at this location, they absolutely HATE their customers.\nThere is almost always a line out the door, but today I peeked in at 4:37 pm and there was no line. So I went up to the teller with a question about a service charge on my checking account. The teller pointed to one of the agents in an office and said, \"She can help you.\" So I walked in to the office and said \"Hi, the teller sent me to you - I have question about my account.\" She replied \"You see that I have my coat on? And I'm wearing my backpack?\" Not understanding, I just continued with my question, and she snapped, \"I'm not working.\" I said incredulously, \"You're leaving? But it's not even 4:40!\" She just pushed past me - no apology or referral to another agent or anything.\nI understand that occasionally people have to leave work early, but she was unbelievably rude. Fed up, I withdrew all my funds and closed my account (which took an inordinately long time; meanwhile, a line grew behind me all the way to the door). Then I took my money a few doors down to Santander, where they greeted me courteously and gladly processed my transaction (even though it was almost closing time). Good riddance, Citizen's Bank. After being rear-ended in a car accident, my car was totaled and I was having pain in my sacrum area. Since I'd had a spinal fusion surgery in the past, I knew I needed to protect myself legally.\n\nFrom my first call with John at Joel H. Schwartz, I felt heard and understood - like a real person, not just another client. He clearly explained my options, the insurance process, and even gave advice on fixing gaps in my car insurance policy.\n\nJohn checked in regularly about my medical appointments and was super responsive - usually within 12 hours. The biggest relief came from how I could focus on getting better while they handled everything else. They got all the paperwork, and I didn't have to worry about the administrative stuff.\n\nWhen it came time to negotiate, John significantly increased their initial offer by nearly 80%, securing a settlement that approached the policy limit within about a week once talks started.\n\nThe team was totally reliable - both Lily and Martin were helpful whenever I reached out. I've already recommended them to a friend who learned more in one meeting than she did in two years with her previous lawyer. If you want someone who actually cares and keeps you in the loop, these folks are your people. Steve was incredibly helpful guiding me on how to handle an issue with an insurance provider. He knew he couldn't take the case due to jurisdictional issues but spent an hour advising me.  The team is honest, straightforward and incredibly bright.  They have helped friends in the past. I had a car accident last year while riding my scooter in a crosswalk when a car didn\u2019t yield. It was a tough situation\u2014post-concussion syndrome, migraines, financial stress. I needed a law firm that could guide me through an injury claim, something I knew nothing about. After some research, I decided on Joel H. Schwartz, P.C., mainly because of their reviews and my first call with Adrian. He was kind, explained the steps, and made me feel comfortable even before signing.\n\nThroughout the process, Megan Burak and her team were amazing. They handled everything professionally and consistently checked in on my recovery. Megan absorbed my anxieties, set up meetings when I needed clarity, and made me feel like I was her partner in the case. While I felt they could\u2019ve pushed harder for the other driver\u2019s insurance info early on and been clearer about potential settlement ranges, they still achieved the maximum settlement allowable under the insurance policy. Their compassionate communication and quick responses were appreciated during this stressful time. Overall, I\u2019d choose them again without a second thought. After getting hit by some kid flying at 100mph in pouring rain on a Maine highway, I needed legal help fast. My case was a mess - I was in a company loaner car, had existing health problems, and the guy who hit me was badly underinsured.\n\nChristopher Dailey at Joel H. Schwartz made sense of everything. He didn't promise the moon, just asked specific questions and explained things clearly. When I needed neck surgery for 99% spinal compression from the crash, Chris fought to prove this was accident-related despite my complex medical history.\n\nThey got me a five figure settlement - not life-changing money, but it covered medical bills and helped while I was on disability. Chris was honest that my payout could've been much bigger with better insurance coverage (which I fixed right away!).\n\nThey were both professional and real people. They were a steady hand during a chaotic time. After some small hiccups at the start, everything with Chris's team was smooth sailing. They handled all the complicated stuff so I could focus on healing.\n\nAlready sent friends their way. When you're hurting and stressed about medical bills, having lawyers who treat you like a person, not just another case number, makes all the difference. Pic below doesn\u2019t do justice to what actually happened. I was in a horrific auto accident that really tore my life apart. I didn\u2019t know what direction to go in, and I was fortunate enough to find Joel H. Schwartz, P.C. I chose them because they made themselves available and impressed me in the initial interview.\n\nFrom the start, they handled all the weight, insurance, bills, and communication, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about a thing. Megan Burak worked on my case, and I couldn\u2019t have been set up with anyone better. She was kind, professional, and incredibly motivated. What I remember most was her deep concern for my health. She would always say, \u201cWe just want you to get better.\u201d Her care and dedication are something I\u2019ll always be grateful for. Shirley Ramroop, branch manager, incredibly rude. Told me to \u201cmake up my mind\u201d when I told her exactly what I wanted in our meeting. I also felt like I was being talked down on, as if I don\u2019t know anything about banking. Fortunately for me, I attend Boston College. So, I do know banking. Shirley only started to be kind to me once I asked what her name was. Horrible experience, typical American customer service. Don\u2019t go here, find a different bank. Love this Bank. Always enjoy seeing my boy Steven(Stevie my Boy as I say). And every teller there is completely professional and I enjoy chatting with all of them. I\u2019m practically live at the bank when I am there almost every day lol. Customer service is terrific at this Santander Bank Branch. I want to especially recognize, Shirley, the Branch Manager, as I was having an issue with the national customer service line not giving me the information that I needed to help my elderly Aunt (my Aunt is a customer, I am not) and Shirley was so kind, patient and highly effective in helping me to find the solution to my Aunt's issue.  Shirley took the time to contact customer service even though the wait time was almost 20 minutes.  She was able to multi-task and help other customers at the same time she helped me and didn't miss a beat. If you are looking for a bank branch with exceptional customer service and a highly skilled and effective branch manager (Yay, Shirley) I would recommend this Santander branch on Boylston Street. Communication is seriously lacking. Elmira is sorely missed. My account is being charged unknown to me who is doing this. No one is here to help, and app is not efficient. However there are still a few bright spots in this branch Avoid this bank. Complete incompetence and total lack of care for dealing with estate accounts. Inaccurate, unprofessional, unethical, inexperienced and no follow up skills. Do yourself a favor and avoid this branch. They have cost my wife endless hours and the end result is having to fly back into Boston just to fix something they could have resolved when she was there in person. A complete lack of empathy and respect in dealing with estate accounts. We had an amazing experience at L\u2019elite Bridal! This was the 3rd wedding dress appointment we had been to and by far the best. Not only was there ample, beautiful dresses to choose from, but from the start we were welcomed and felt special.  The expertise of everyone we meet at L\u2019elite was by far first-rate. Our sales associate, Mona, was absolutely amazing and our entire party is still talking about how great she was! L\u2019elite was the only shop that allowed my daughter and her maid of honor to actually look through their selection and pick out dresses for herself \u2014 Mona would direct them to racks based on budget and preference, but the dress she ended up picking would have never been pulled if she just told Mona the styles she liked. In fact, my daughter picked it to try on for fun because it was totally different  and beautiful, but not what she was envisioning. Once on we knew!! Mona did such an amazing and respectful job giving feedback, guiding my daughter and was never pushy. When my daughter said yes to the dress she gave her a big hug! Mona was on our side! In every photo we took of my daughter, Mona is in the background with the biggest, supportive smile on her face. My daughter absolutely loves the dress she chose, and we could have not have had a better experience. I had a wonderful experience today at L\u2019elite Bridal with Sarah! She was incredibly professional, kind, and patient\u2014helping me try on several dresses without hesitation. I really appreciated how she recommended styles that suited me and stayed within my budget. Her guidance made the entire process enjoyable and stress-free. Highly recommend working with her! Lelite has been so helpful and amazing throughout the process of finding and altering my dress. Specifically, Lena has been so amazing at tailoring my dress to become my dream dress as I always imagined. She is very patient and timely and detail oriented. I have all my trust in her! She has made the process go so smooth and always reassuring. I recommended her so much! I had such a special experience working with Mona to find my wedding dress! I came to L'Elite twice, and both times, Mona helped me. She felt like a family member by the end of the experience - she was so warm, kind, and thoughtful. She gave good advice when I asked for it, without ever being pushy. The entire shopping experience felt really special and stood apart from the other bridal boutiques I visited. If you are coming to L'Elite, I highly recommend requesting Mona!\n\nMy mom also got her MOB dress in L'Elite Occasions, and unfortunately, we did not have the same experience, although she ended up buying a really beautiful dress. I'm not sure I'd recommend the Occasions group, but the Bridal shop is 10/10. I had the most amazing experience at this bridal boutique while finding my dream wedding dress! From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by how spacious and well-organized the room was. As a plus-size bride, I was thrilled to find so many beautiful options that made me feel confident and excited.\n\nA huge thank you to Isabel, who truly made the experience unforgettable. She was incredibly patient, attentive, and had such a great eye for fashion. Isabel listened to everything I wanted and helped me find the perfect dress that made me feel like the best version of myself. Her expertise and kindness made all the difference.\n\nI couldn't have asked for a better experience. I highly recommend this boutique to any bride \u2013 they made me feel comfortable, celebrated, and beautiful! Amazing experience! The staff is very knowledgable and easily helped me find a new pair of distance running shoes. Shoshana helped me, and she was so kind, friendly, and professional. Her assessment of what I need in a shoe was spot on, and she easily found something perfect for my training needs. Luke from the Boston location was a huge help this past weekend when I went in looking for new shoes. I went in hoping someone could give me recommendations, because I had an idea of what I wanted but wasn\u2019t exactly sure what shoes to try. He was attentive and fast, gave me a few different options to try, and went the extra mile to have the shoes I chose shipped to my home from another store because they didn\u2019t have the color I wanted in this store. All in all, a great experience and I\u2019ll be going back the next time I need new sneakers! Evan and Shoshanna were incredibly knowledgeable in helping my girlfriend find the perfect shoes for the Boston Marathon! She was curious about carbon plated shoes for the big day and they brought out many options, talking us through each one, making her feel much more confident for race day! In a fast paced world it was a wonderful feeling to connect with people who have the same passions and want to see others succeed! We truly had the best experience. I believe her name was Shoshanna, she helped my husband Josh so much! She addressed him by name each time, was sooo knowledgeable. I even ended up buying shoes because how incredible the service was. Her, her shadow everyone was truly amazing. This service was incredible we tell everyone! I just love how personable it was, you go girl! Thank you and your staff! Walked in off the street. Running my first 5K, well most likely walk jogging. Evan was so helpful!!! He helped me understand everything about my own foot and preferences. Fabulous personality and amazing information. I appreciate the time he took with me so much! Gotta bring my husband in! Thank you Even! Brand selection is good and a large choice. The adidas pants where locked with a steel cable, that makes it a very slow process. To untackle them you need a salesperson and the shopping experience a pain. The staff make you feel like you're troubling them, and they are not very passioned. Great store and good prices, unfortunately it will be closing soon, but just this location only. So sad :-( It came across as a bit sexist that four different male staff members chose not to help me and all stood around waiting on one male customer together instead. I almost didn't buy anything because I was so frustrated, but I needed new running shoes and they at least did have what I was looking for at a reasonable price. Sales tip: don't ignore your customers when you are overstaffed. One time I bought shoes here and left without getting the security tag taken off. I realized hours later, called back, and they managed to track down the guy who sold me the shoes. He remembered me and had my back since I had lost my receipt.\n\nGot great service when looking for a new basketball, too! Horrible \u201cReward Program\u201d and customer service linked to it. They make you spend 100s/1000s just to get $10-20 off and they force you to try to save the hard copy receipt. Came in to try to redeem a \u201creward\u201d I earned and didn\u2019t think a paper receipt would be necessary considering they have my info in their system.\nSaid they couldn\u2019t honor it and made me wait an additional 15-20 mins while they went in the back to talk to customer service for a measly $20 off.\nHorrible experience. They need an update ASAP. Super friendly staff and large selection of amazing hats. Ended up having a hard time choosing between two hats. Had to choose only one. Highly recommend Goorin Brother if you are in the area. Great place with friendly staff. Lots of choices all of high quality products. Not overly expensive either. Hat stores can be intimidating places but not Goorin Bros Hat Shop. The staff member was helpful, and answering all of my questions in a friendly way with a no-pressure manner. The store had a great collection of straw hats of different styles, and had the perfect foldable hat for me. When I made my purchase he steamed not only my hat, but the one my wife was wearing. It was a wonderful experience and I now have the hat I've that I've wanted for a long time. Went into this store to just browse the fedoras, but ended up taking one home. The guy helping me, Brent, was super chill and down-to-earth. He really made my first shopping experience here amazing! The other guy working (not sure of his name) was also really nice and chill. This place also gave me retro 20's vibes with the music and the old black and white photos, which I loved. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking at buying a hat! I stop here every time I'm in Boston because it really is a great hat shop. They have an excellent selection and the staff is always knowledgeable and willing to help find something that looks and fits right. They will even steam hats to fit you perfectly. The absolute worst cashier I had the displeasure of dealing with. This woman today was also incredibly rude, condescending and a nightmare altogether. I've never been treated with such a disrespect and unprofessionalism. Please get this woman outta here or get her and the whole crew some serious training in customer service. One of, if not the worst 7/11s in the city. The people that work there are nice enough, but the warm food cases are almost always empty. This particular 7-11 never cleans up the trash and litter that is outside their store. 80% of the litter is theirs. Pizza boxes, straws/wrappers, cups/lids it\u2019s so bad. Take care of this city outside your store each and every day. Every 7 Eleven accepts EBT except this location. Tells me it's broken and they have no intentions on fixing it. I shouldn't have to use cash for lunch when they should be accepting EBT. Avoid location at all cost since they are there to serve a certain demographic. Can't afford to even give the homeless change that are constantly swarming the front of their door since this place is such a cash grab. It's definitely not 24 hours. CVS just around the corner are though. Best cupcakes I've ever had!\nThe cream is so thick, you'll feel the richness in each bite.\n\nI would recommend trying the red velvet one, it's out of the world.\n\nThey made my 2-dozen order ready even during a snow storm! So hats off to the staff. To start they are overpriced for what you get and there was a long line. Despite the line we decided to try it. The location is convenient, inside is nice, and the cupcakes looked delicious. As for the cupcakes themselves, the standard vanilla on vanilla was delicious. However, the chocolate peanut butter cupcake tasted horrible. The peanut butter tasted as if it was made with salted butter, and the chocolate had a burnt coffee taste to it. The purple unicorn (essentially vanilla with food coloring) tasted as if it was just cream cheese that sat out for a week as the \u201cicing\u201d was crunchy. The actual cupcakes were hard and lacked and sort of freshness. My wife ordered Gluten Free, and could barely get through one, as it was hard, crunchy and tasteless. The staff were cold, just pushed people along. That being said the gentleman boxing the cupcakes was amazing, super friendly and funny. For the amount we paid, we were highly disappointed. We expected so much better, especially with all the bakeries in the city. Would not recommend. Not sure how I didn\u2019t know about Georgetown Cupcake (probably because I just moved from Texas) I was looking for birthday cake and a friend told I should order cupcakes instead from here.\nMy friend was right and I\u2019m glad I ordered from here!!! These really are amazing fabulous cupcakes. SUPER moist with the buttercream frosting.... Absolutely wonderful. I could have eaten a full dozen. The size is like the kind you make at home, not the giant ones like Sprinkles or Costco. Reasonably priced, the hardest part will be deciding which flavor you want!!! I will definitely be ordering again and recommending to ALL! They usually have two flavors of vegan cupcakes , it's either carrot cupcakes or apple cinnamon. I got the apple cinnamon which was ok but pricey $$$ for the size.\n\nThe To-go packaging was super cute.\n\nMy friend got the chocolate ganache and one more cupcake that had eggs so I couldn't try them but he said they were so-so.\n\nI appreciate that staff wore gloves while picking up.the vegan cupcakes and packed it separately from the non vegan cupcakes.\n\nMy friend who was their customer had restroom emergency but they refused saying the restroom was closed which was unfortunate.\n\nWon't be going again, it was ok for one time. Great selection of cupcakes. They are super delucious, on the smaller side, which I love, not crazy sweet - just right and are always made fresh and moist. Love popping in for a quick treat when in the area. And the added bonus - Thinking Cup is next door, so you can get a nice espresso afterwards. This should be renamed as bank of china as they only serve the Chinese speaking people on priority and even let them cut the queue. If you are not chinese they are very cold to serve you.i walked in and was asked to wait but a Chinese customer who visited later was served ahead of me, guess what they don't even had an appointment. Fen and Elizabeta are definitely awesome in their work, I just want to express my gratitude to them for helping me to solve my issues related to shutting down my BOA accounts. They are helpful, kind, responsible and professional, shout out to them!!! We arrived late on Saturday afternoon and the whole team was so friendly and helpful, Fen Guo\u2018s service to open our bank accounts was just excellent, thanks a lot! I have an issue and called two times  ~ no response.  Usually use a different Bank of America and have very good service. I've only had good experiences here.  Even when there has been a wait, it was short.  Business was transacted quickly, professionally, and never made me feel demeaned or underappreciated.  I'm there to hold my money and retrieve or move it when needed; we don't need to be pals. I bought some products when they have a 40% promotion and want to check the batch code at store but they not allow me. When I bring it home and check, the production date was almost 3 years ago, so I have to return it. When I bring it to the store to return, the staff who did the return was extreme rude. She kept informing me that the return products will become trash, but I think when  it was out of date it would become trash anyway. Also, if you apply your family point when you purchase, you will not take it back when you return, so I will lose $50 from my 500 points if I return. I love Kiehl's product but I can't rate this store higher than 1*. If I could give this Kiehl's location infinite stars I would!!!! From the moment I set foot in the store the service was top notch. Even though the store was busy the women working there were attentive and made sure to acknowledge my presence. I have always been intimidated and confused by skincare and never knew exactly what I was doing and what to purchase. Colyn and her colleague Tahlya were stellar. From the in depth skin assessment where they take a series of 9 photos to show you what's really going on below the surface, to the skincare education, I cannot recommend this store enough. I now have a routine that is quick and easy, and I understand why I am doing it thanks to Colyn. So if you're like me or you just need/want to genuinely know what is going on with your skin or what your skin type even is- GO TO KIEHL's on Newbury!! Oh and I raved about this so much to my boyfriend that we returned and got it done for him too! Thank you, thank you, thank you!! We are Kiehl's customers for life =) This is the second time I come here! I bought a eye treatment today 6/19/2017. I 'm complaining it's Not about the product! It's about the seller who is very impolite!  After I pay she said she don't have a big bag for my Creamy eye treatment!  The customer who before me they did get a paper bag! I just so Surprised what she said! And unhappy about this!  Also she seems like An Asian lady! But I promise I never go back again! The service is terrible there! It's 51 US dollars! What do you mean you don't have a bag! What a wonderful and amazing experience! Colyn did such a great job of explaining the products, the purpose of them, and how to apply them properly. Very glad to have met her and I will be a Kiehl\u2019s customer for life! Colin helped my husband and I through our facial analyses and she was so helpful, kind and knowledgeable! We learned a lot about skin care and are excited to try some new personalized products. The bank is the problem the problem is the people that work at the bank. Don't let them tell you you have to wait for over an hour to see someone for help. The bank just had opened up. Put your foot down and get what you need.  Y'all will never forget my face after February 26/2025. I had the worse experience with 2 black individuals working there. I refused to wait 40 minutes plus for something that took 3 minutes. I demanded I get assistance. If one day in the amen of Jesus I get the chance to contact there manager or boss I will have them written up. I got dismissed on this day I did not take it calmly.  If I could rate this a zero star I would. Y'all do even deserve a 1 star. Black people get good jobs and forget who the hell they are in the inside and out. you will never be as good to a white person even if you're wearing a suit and tie working in a white owned company they will always look at you the same and for you to treat your own kind the way that you did is ridiculous. FANTASTIC BANK!!! I come here daily to drop off my bank deposits for work, the entire staff is beyond friendly, kind and genuinely goes out of their way to help in any way, fantastic people 100%  Ive had such an amazing experience the last few months that I opened a personal account for myself with this bank. If you're looking for a new bank to bank with this bank specifically is it!!:)))) I used the street level counter service a couple of times during a recent trip to Boston.  I was greeted by a very professional young man who directed me to the teller.  The teller was a young lady who was very professional and efficient in providing change from larger bills.  The young man greeter and I then had a very pleasant conversation regarding Boston, business, etc...\nHe was a very articulate and charming young Asian man, originally from China.  I relayed to him my past travels in China and conducting business in China.  I don't recall his name, but he also gave me suggestions for sites to see and restaurants in Boston.  Overall, very nice experience at this BOA facility. I went into the Bank of America branch on Boylston street, Boston location and got a rude awakening of what discrimination feels like. While I was there, the check that I deposited got stuck in the ATM. I saw one of the employees assisting a Latin American woman (on the white side), so I waited for her to finish with the customer and explained my situation. Then I asked if she could assist me. She said in a nasty voice; that she didn't know how to use the machine and that I would have to contact someone outside the branch. Not at any point did she walk over to evaluate the problem. Instead, she continued to be dismissive and cold.\n\nI explained to the employee that it might be something that she could help me with since the ATM was prompting me to go back and put in the amount, but I could not find where to enter the transaction amount. She proceeded to ignore me and move on to an Asian customer that had just walked through the door. Talk about passive-aggressive. At this point, I knew that she wanted me to feel inferior, so I decided to speak up for myself, explained that I had a check worth thousands stuck in the branch's ATM, and to either assist me or call a manager. Again she argued that she did not know how to use the machine, but I held my ground.\n\nFinally, she came over, pressed a few buttons, and it turned out that she \u2018did know' how to use the machine.\nFrustrated by the employees lack of professionalism, I asked to speak with the her manager. That's when I learned that the woman discriminating against me was the branch manager. I left in disbelief. I felt like I was being pitted against the other two customers because, in her mind, I did not fit the demographics of that area. The message that I got; is that my business is not as valuable because I am black.\n\nAfter experiencing this level of disrespect and unfairness from this branch location, I hope Bank of America does something about this systematic racism amongst its employees.\nI'm sharing my story publicly because I hope people will start speaking up. And finally, I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through. This Bank of America has the worst customer service I have ever seen. My mother who speaks english as a second language went to this location at the designated appointment time provided to her. She wanted to open up a savings account for my little brother. The agent assisting her wasn't available, so the manager came over. When my Mom asked questions about the savings account and instead the manager began push other services she did not need. Once he realized she was not receptive to what he was offering he began to patronize and talk down to her. He was not willing to assist her at all. My Mother left the bank disheartened and demoralized. I am not sure if the manager has biases or needs additional training but I do not recommend anyone going to this bank. I tried to call the bank to resolve this matter and they are not picking up. I will be escalating this issue with Bank of America Headquarters. Super friendly staff and large selection of amazing hats. Ended up having a hard time choosing between two hats. Had to choose only one. Highly recommend Goorin Brother if you are in the area. Great place with friendly staff. Lots of choices all of high quality products. Not overly expensive either. Hat stores can be intimidating places but not Goorin Bros Hat Shop. The staff member was helpful, and answering all of my questions in a friendly way with a no-pressure manner.

Oh and I raved about this so much to my boyfriend that we returned and got it done for him too! Thank you, thank you, thank you!! We are Kiehl's customers for life =) This is the second time I come here! I bought a eye treatment today 6/19/2017. I 'm complaining it's Not about the product! It's about the seller who is very impolite!  After I pay she said she don't have a big bag for my Creamy eye treatment!  The customer who before me they did get a paper bag! I just so Surprised what she said! And unhappy about this!  Also she seems like An Asian lady! But I promise I never go back again! The service is terrible there! It's 51 US dollars! What do you mean you don't have a bag! What a wonderful and amazing experience! Colyn did such a great job of explaining the products, the purpose of them, and how to apply them properly. Very glad to have met her and I will be a Kiehl\u2019s customer for life! Colin helped my husband and I through our facial analyses and she was so helpful, kind and knowledgeable! We learned a lot about skin care and are excited to try some new personalized products. The bank is the problem the problem is the people that work at the bank. Don't let them tell you you have to wait for over an hour to see someone for help. The bank just had opened up. Put your foot down and get what you need.  Y'all will never forget my face after February 26/2025. I had the worse experience with 2 black individuals working there. I refused to wait 40 minutes plus for something that took 3 minutes. I demanded I get assistance. If one day in the amen of Jesus I get the chance to contact there manager or boss I will have them written up. I got dismissed on this day I did not take it calmly.  If I could rate this a zero star I would. Y'all do even deserve a 1 star. Black people get good jobs and forget who the hell they are in the inside and out. you will never be as good to a white person even if you're wearing a suit and tie working in a white owned company they will always look at you the same and for you to treat your own kind the way that you did is ridiculous. FANTASTIC BANK!!! I come here daily to drop off my bank deposits for work, the entire staff is beyond friendly, kind and genuinely goes out of their way to help in any way, fantastic people 100%  Ive had such an amazing experience the last few months that I opened a personal account for myself with this bank. If you're looking for a new bank to bank with this bank specifically is it!!:)))) I used the street level counter service a couple of times during a recent trip to Boston.  I was greeted by a very professional young man who directed me to the teller.  The teller was a young lady who was very professional and efficient in providing change from larger bills.  The young man greeter and I then had a very pleasant conversation regarding Boston, business, etc...\nHe was a very articulate and charming young Asian man, originally from China.  I relayed to him my past travels in China and conducting business in China.  I don't recall his name, but he also gave me suggestions for sites to see and restaurants in Boston.  Overall, very nice experience at this BOA facility. I went into the Bank of America branch on Boylston street, Boston location and got a rude awakening of what discrimination feels like. While I was there, the check that I deposited got stuck in the ATM. I saw one of the employees assisting a Latin American woman (on the white side), so I waited for her to finish with the customer and explained my situation. Then I asked if she could assist me. She said in a nasty voice; that she didn't know how to use the machine and that I would have to contact someone outside the branch. Not at any point did she walk over to evaluate the problem. Instead, she continued to be dismissive and cold.\n\nI explained to the employee that it might be something that she could help me with since the ATM was prompting me to go back and put in the amount, but I could not find where to enter the transaction amount. She proceeded to ignore me and move on to an Asian customer that had just walked through the door. Talk about passive-aggressive. At this point, I knew that she wanted me to feel inferior, so I decided to speak up for myself, explained that I had a check worth thousands stuck in the branch's ATM, and to either assist me or call a manager. Again she argued that she did not know how to use the machine, but I held my ground.\n\nFinally, she came over, pressed a few buttons, and it turned out that she \u2018did know' how to use the machine.\nFrustrated by the employees lack of professionalism, I asked to speak with the her manager. That's when I learned that the woman discriminating against me was the branch manager. I left in disbelief. I felt like I was being pitted against the other two customers because, in her mind, I did not fit the demographics of that area. The message that I got; is that my business is not as valuable because I am black.\n\nAfter experiencing this level of disrespect and unfairness from this branch location, I hope Bank of America does something about this systematic racism amongst its employees.\nI'm sharing my story publicly because I hope people will start speaking up. And finally, I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through. This Bank of America has the worst customer service I have ever seen. My mother who speaks english as a second language went to this location at the designated appointment time provided to her. She wanted to open up a savings account for my little brother. The agent assisting her wasn't available, so the manager came over. When my Mom asked questions about the savings account and instead the manager began push other services she did not need. Once he realized she was not receptive to what he was offering he began to patronize and talk down to her. He was not willing to assist her at all. My Mother left the bank disheartened and demoralized. I am not sure if the manager has biases or needs additional training but I do not recommend anyone going to this bank. I tried to call the bank to resolve this matter and they are not picking up. I will be escalating this issue with Bank of America Headquarters. I\u2019ve been in twice and both times the staff has been incredibly rude when I said I didn\u2019t want to provide a phone number or email. Just now the tall male employee was insistent on an email. I\u2019ve never had to give one to shop at any GNC or other store. I left without spending money. \u201cManager\u201d is very sassy. Sold me an open product and charged me to exchange for that SAME EXACT product. Only difference was that it was not open\u2026. I wish I could leave 0 stars, Billy refused to sell my something without giving him my phone number. Will not return This is literally the worst store I have been to. They refused to process my payment just because I choose not to disclose my phone number and email? Someone should report this store to the authorities for unethical business practice ! I'm assuming they want to earn extra commission even when they have zero interaction with the customers or probably harvesting your data. Cashier refused to sell me a $4 energy drink because I would not give my phone number for a dollar off.\n\nWhen I told him I\u2019d rather pay full price, he responded that this is a time of economic crisis, and there are entire movements to saving money. He then claimed it would\nnot ring out without my phone number - which is untrue.\n\nI would not give my phone number to a stranger on the street offering $1, why should I give it to GNC? This place has done me right for 4 plus years, but tonight Danny went above and beyond. I bought some Pinot noir not realizing it was a cork screw. So I\u2019m at home trying my best, but I\u2019m just a girl right, so naturally I was struggling. Tried whacking it with a hammer, no luck, so I went back to the store. Danny helped me immediately and legit opened the wine for me. He deserves the raise of the century. Good customer service to a complete idiot, he didn\u2019t even make me feel silly about this, just helped!!!!!! Ordered 2 bottles of champagne to be delivered as gifts. It was completed quickly and the price was reasonable. Thank you! This downtown wine store is a hidden gem! The selection is impressive, featuring a wide range of wines at reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, offering great recommendations. The wine tasting experience was delightful, making it easy to find the perfect bottle. Highly recommend this place for any wine lover! Parth is very hard working and knowledgeable person. He suggest me amazing wine and vodka for gifts. He had a lots of options for me. I got an amazing collection with my price range. Absolutely worth the product and visit. Highly recommended for visit\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a The selection of wines and whiskeys is outstanding, catering to both connoisseurs and casual drinkers. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly, always ready with excellent recommendations. The shop itself is beautifully arranged, making browsing a pleasure. Recommended for anyone looking to find quality bottles and a great shopping experience! not convenient any more, over charges for all fee's,  .\nthey charged me 100 dollars to transfer a credit card balance to their bank.\nToo Big !\nCanada's version of Spains Sandender and American version of B.O.A.... Actually terrible staff here. Hung up on me during a phone call and was extremely rude. Not the same as it was years ago. Customer service here has gone downhill. I deposited a check on August 10th, the transaction appears to be August 12th on my app and I was okay with that. But now it is August 20th and my money is still on hold. The app says just 6 bus days hold. I went to ask a banker if there was any problem with my check, he just was quiet, pushed a few buttons and finally showed me a calendar. He started counting the days for me in a form like I didn't know how to count them, ending with \"today is day 6, you have to wait until the next business day to have your money\". Why does it take so long for a nationwide bank to run a clearance on a check from a university? I'm regretting opening an account with this bank and not being told to cash the check instead of depositing it. The way the banker talked to me was disrespectful and he didn't even give me options for making my money available early. That check is my stipend from university, and I have bills to pay but the bank doesn't even care. There was no empathy with customers, and the banker made me feel like stupid. tried to open a bank account. sebastian said yes. I sat down. \u201cdo you have two forms of id?\u201d \u201cyes\u201d a couple of minutes later \u201cwe\u2019re actually pretty understaffed and I\u2019m the only teller so it might not happen\u201d \u201chow long does it take\u201d \u201c15-20 minutes\u201d\n\nI\u2019m good. mans was just looking for an excuse to go home imo. Came on a Sunday\u2014place was clean and spacious. The customer service rep Steven was friendly and funny. They let me stay 20 minutes pass closing time to wrap up the task. Wouldn\u2019t have had time Mon-Fri to go, very thankful for the customer service! I had to get a suit delivered to this location and I couldn't pick it up until the day before the wedding I was going to, and Moises was wonderful in assisting me. He offered me something to drink when I arrived, he steamed the suit while I tried on some other items, and even directed me to a local tailor that they work with to get the pants hemmed! He was very polite and personable and I'm glad I picked my suit up here. The tailor was also very quick and efficient, Daniel over at Raymond Personal Tailor got me in and out within 20 min. Caroline was awesome!  She helped me from A to Z and listened to every concerns I had.  Being a skinny 5'2\" dude never had I put on an adult shirt that fits me perfectly w/o tailoring before I came to this store.  The whole experience was just wonderful!  They may not have every design you see online but it is worth visiting to just try things out and receive advice.  Now that I found my favorite store I will definitely come back! I went in and received great service from Jordan! Most importantly, the pants fit great. I have already ordered more. Great experience! Nice men's formal/dress wear. They had a variety of styles, colors, sizes, and fits to try on. Super friendly staff who were helpful but not pushy. Can't wait for my shirts to arrive. Yvan is a personable and professional sales associate; and was able to pick up on/tolerate my dry, deadpan humor and whimsical demeanor. Yvan educated me and my partner on several measurement/fitting intricacies, and helped me find a wedding outfit that fits my disproportionate body(!) I would hire Yvan in a heartbeat\u2014thank you for your amazing customer service! After years of following TB12 and reading about all they have to offer, I was excited to get my first one-on-one session at the Boston location. I am healthy and exercise several times a week, so I wasn't sure how much this would help. I was extremely impressed with the work my body coach performed and left feeling even better than I did before. While I was there, I also signed up for a Group Training class and got a smoothie! Overall, the experience was amazing and I highly recommend that everyone checks it out. I am VERY GRATEFUL to have received a private TB12 sports therapy treatment at a Boston event... because treatment is expensive, BUT... it IS worth it. \ud83d\ude09\n\nMy left shoulder was in pain all year. So, I\u2019d been moving it a lot less\u2026 And it became stiff and lost some mobility. I saw doctors, rubbed  creams on it and soaked in Epsom salt baths. I just couldn\u2019t regain my mobility or reduce my pain.\n\nThen, in flies TB12... Their physical therapist released my \u201clocked scapula\u201d in 20 minutes! \ud83d\udd25\n\nTHE DEAL: If you can afford this treatment, by all means, you should check them out. If you don\u2019t think you can afford this treatment...can you afford to keep living with limited mobility and chronic pain? Attended their Total Body Conditioning group class twice now. It's intense & science-based, with extensive pre and post-workout foam rolling (the vibrating rollers are probably insanely expensive, but wow!) and a focus on controlled movements with bands, medicine balls, etc. The instructor (Emma, I believe?) was very helpful, knowledgable, and motivating.\n\nNice shower and locker fascilities as well. Expensive, but tasty protein shakes upstairs.\n\nI'm sure the personal training and the classes are expensive normally. But attending via ClassPass and not taking money into account, this has been my favorite workout of many that I've tried. Had to stop by to support the GOAT winning his 7th championship. The clothes are a pricey but it's Brady everyone needs a Brady shirt. The store is very modern and the staff is pretty friendly. Hope they open a TB12 store in Texas one day. Tom Brady &  Alex Guerrero have forever altered my life!  I'm 51 & I can high kick way past my shoulders... I stopped by the AT&T store on Boylston Street not too long ago, and the service was seriously top-notch. The staff was super friendly, helpful, welcoming and made everything really easy to understand. I wasn\u2019t even sure what I needed walking in, but they took the time to walk me through everything without rushing or pressuring me. You can tell they actually care about the customer experience. Highly recommend this location! Very nice AT&T shop. Friendly and helpful team. Jey (Jelly?) did an excellent job checking my phone's compatibility to AT&T's SIM. She's also checked voice and data services were active before I left the shop. I was very pleased. I have been a customer at Verizon for over 22 years. However, recently when I was trying to upgrade my phone became increasingly more frustrated in dealing with their customer service. I never could get a straight answer and a plan that would suit me.  I literally walked down the street and into AT&T. I was greeted by Wercy Diaz.  Within 5 minutes he had a plan and cost of a new iPhone and Apple watch.  Fully transparent of all the costs and fees with no pressure.  I literally returned the next day with my wife and we both switched over from Verizon.  My wife even got an Apple watch as well.  Wercy was extremely patient and helpful in the process and has continued to be accessible with questions about billing and the Apple products.  He was simply amazing.  Customer service as it should be. I walked into the AT&T store on Boylston Street recently and was blown away by how attentive and genuine Jey was. She answered all my questions found me a great upgrade deal, and never once made me feel rushed. Five stars for service & people that actually care ! I had a fantastic experience at this AT&T store on Boylston Street. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful. A lovely lady assisted me with paying off my devices, and the process was smooth and efficient even thought there's something wrong with my bank. I truly appreciated her professionalism and willingness to help. Excellent customer service\u2014thank you! I had an amazing experience at Lush thanks to Ellis and Chance! Ellis was incredibly knowledgeable\u2014he knew exactly where every product on my list was and gave great recommendations. His expertise made my shopping trip super smooth and enjoyable. He was also incredibly sweet. Chance was also fantastic at checkout, super patient and kind while helping me finalize my purchase. It\u2019s rare to find such genuinely helpful and friendly staff, and these two made my visit an absolute pleasure. Big shoutout to both of them for their outstanding service! I am visiting Boston from Texas and as a Lushie I always love to check out the local store. This store is absolutely beautiful! As one of their larger \u201canchor\u201d stores, they have more products in stock than my store back home. I worked with Chris who warmly greeted me and gave me a tour of the store. He pointed out some store exclusives, just what I was looking for to get gifts for some family. I ended up coming the next day to get a few more things and Chris was there and remembered me! He asked me what some of my favorite scents are and then ended up gifting me a solid perfume in a scent I\u2019ve always wanted as a perfume! I love how lush always makes me feel so welcome and uplifted. Thank you Chris for your kindness and making this a highlight of my trip! Ava was incredibly kind and helpful during my visit to Lush! She took the time to help me put together the perfect gift for my boyfriend, patiently showing me a variety of products that he might enjoy. Her thoughtful recommendations were spot on\u2014he absolutely loved it! Ava\u2019s warm and attentive service made my shopping experience so enjoyable. Huge shoutout to Aya at Lush Cosmetics! From the moment we walked in, she made us feel welcome and went above and beyond to help us find exactly what we needed. Her knowledge of organic products and friendly attitude made our shopping experience amazing. If you\u2019re looking for top-notch customer service, Aya is the one to see! I went the other week but I can\u2019t recommend this store enough! Nathan and Gino (I could be spelling his name wrong!) were so helpful and friendly and I found the BEST gifts for my niece\u2019s birthday party! They are awesome. Great service. Their app is awesome with the \u201con my way\u201d feature so I can double park real quick and run in and grab your stuff. We live in Charlestown but because I can drop clothes off 24 hours and with the easy pick up - it\u2019s a no brainer. Poor customer service. Even poorer communications. I sent a pair of leather pants for cleaning, expecting the special handling meant longer than the standard twice-a-week delivery turnaround. They said \"2 to 3 weeks.\" They've had my pants for over 5-6 weeks! They never called me. Twice, I've called them. Most recently, they said my pants were back from the outside vendor and would be delivered ...um, yesterday. No delivery. No explanation. This is horrible service. No follow-up. No one calls me. I have to contact them. To make matters worse, Dependable is charging me $184!!! I've been their customer for 20+ years but will be re-thinking dry cleaning services. I have to make a special trip into Boston to go to Dependable Cleaners on Newbury Street, but it is worth it.  I buy good clothes and I trust that they will turn my order around quickly and do an excellent job. I dropped off my white sweater off with a small light brown stain and when I received it back, there was a larger brown stain on it that was in a circle as if someone had put a pot of coffee on my sweater. Now I have two stains on my sweater although luckily the original had faded a bit after they treated it, but the new stain is worse than the old stain. About six years ago, this place ruined most of my business shirts, and I'm still finding damaged shirts in my wardrobe. They used some type of chemical on collars that discolored the fabric. It was extremely evident on white shirts. I think they reimbursed me for one shirt, and that was it. I just pulled a sky blue shirt from my closet, as I was thinking of wearing it to my wedding reception. The collar is discolored, and there's a scratch on the lapel. The last place I took it was Dependable. Meaghan and her team went above and beyond to make sure that I got the perfect pair of jeans for my 30th birthday. She provided the best customer service I\u2019ve ever received and really made my buying experience so special. Thank you to everyone at Rag and Bone Boston who helped out!! Very unfortunate that this store was trying to charge me $15 for a repair instead of honoring the brand\u2019s quality guarantee. Citing that I purchased the product in December, and it had been \u201calmost a year\u201d, which is a made-up policy. Would stick to the seaport location where the staff are much more accommodating. Best jeans you can find! And you can wear it for many years! Really amazing service. Manager helped me and my girlfriend with jeans and even told me about their special warehouse sale. Get the man a raise I\u2019m mind blown with how rude one of the employees was at this location. I\u2019ve never had someone speak to or treat me like she did, mind you unprovoked. I was browsing jeans and she came up to me visibly irritated and extremely unprofessional, apparently for picking up a pair I wanted to try on without asking her (even though I was never instructed to)? I\u2019m still confused with what the problem was. I\u2019ve never experienced something like this before and can tell you I wouldn\u2019t speak to someone the way she did. We won\u2019t be back. The other day, I tried to purchase a bracelet here. I got there right after 10, but the girl hadn't opened yet. She was on the phone when we (my boyfriend and I) walked in so all we got was a quick \"how can I help you\". I asked for the bracelet by name and she just walked away without saying anything. I followed her and she turned around seemingly surprised, like she forgot or didn't realize I had asked for it. Turns out they didn't have it in the store, but she never offered to check any other stores or order one to be mailed to me (a service that is supposed to be free if the store does not have the item in stock). She then was apparently content with her customer service and went back to her phone call at the register. I then walked around a bit more on my own (she couldn't even see me) and at that point she noticed my boyfriend waiting for me. She went to try to sell him something, but he wasn't having it. I worked for a different location several years ago and if any of us had behaved like this girl did, we would've been written up or fired. I'm so disappointed in this experience and see no reason why I should continue to give this location any more of my business. Not even one star to actually rate LOL.\nmy boyfriend felt very uncomfortable when there and especially at the cash register. My boyfriend and i were looking for bracelets that\u2019s for a couple. so. i asked and the girl was nice enough to show me and then when i turned to my boyfriend to see what he likes. she started to change her appearance (as in giving off negative vibes and a whole different face) She then asked while i was looking and asked me \u201cis this for your - GIRLfriend?\u201d and we clearly were holding hands together when entering in. we felt pretty offended especially when she gave looks and awkward silence at the cash register. the other girl was standing with her too . i don\u2019t know if she has any other things to do .. I went in to purchase a bracelet and the saleswoman didn't seem to have a genuine interest in me or even a genuine interest in making a sale at the least. Now that I have been wearing the bracelet for about a week now, it has a cheap feel to it. I would not recommend this store nor will I recommend their product. This store is odd. there was a women in the front when we first got in who greeted us, we went to the second floor and the girl was literally sitting on the floor behind the counter so had no idea anyone was even there. we looked around and decided to buy two bangles. the girl was a little blah about it, no enthusiasm and she rang us up. we left and as I walked out the door and didn't notice the caution tape on the door stop because well it wasn't visible, I stepped and rolled my ankle pretty badly. There was NO ONE at the front to see this or to help myself or my mother. That step at the threshold of the store NEEDS to be fixed and a damn small beat up bit of caution tape on the FLOOR is not noticeable at all. that needs to be fixed because I could have injured myself 10x worse. Alex and Ani is a staple store for the College Crowd...\nShoppers design their own custom charm bracelets.\nI love customized jewelry, and they have lots of charms.\n\nI've gone to several VIP EVENTS they've hosted,\nand provided complimentary drinks and cookies.\nThey are well publicized and very crowded for the small space.\nWomen were trapped against the wall of their narrow aisle. Overpriced sadly, and taste was just okay. We got the beef udon stir fry, udon curry, grilled yam and okra appetizers, bibimbap and grilled saba fish. For me, everything was good to mid. Won\u2019t be coming back. A friend who ate here this last Thursday talked up Zaku - claiming to be one of the best meals he has had in years. I was skeptical but went with him on Saturday to see for myself and it was pretty perfect.\n\nThe sauces, the miso, the sake, and everything in between was on point and the food was often served by the chef as well as our waiter. We managed to eat ourselves SICK and three people having an obscene amount of a-la-carte food and sake had a bill that was only $240.\n\nThis place was wildly good. I\u2019ll be back - soon! A somewhat mediocre experience. The night we went, they were sold out of a large portion of their sake selection, and couldn\u2019t make any mixed drinks because there was no one servicing the bar. They were also sold out of a few of their food items. The service was a bit slow. Overall an alright place. **NOTE: I've amended this review which had previously listed a service charge that was erroneously charged to us on our initial visit.  It has since been resolved. I've added additional items we've tried on our second return below (1 week later).**\n\nRIP to Shun's Kitchen! Came here on a Thursday evening at ~530pm and was seated with no issues. Interior d\u00e9cor is very nice and staff was friendly (they offered us hot towels after we sat down!).\n\nIn my opinion the Prefix Menu that they offer ($55 per person) is quite the deal and is STRONGLY recommended. You get a choice of up 2 cold and 2 hot appetizers, an entr\u00e9e and a dessert. Here are the items we ordered (as of 5/2024).\n\nFor the Prefix Menu:\n- Seaweed salad (normally $6) - Refreshing and not too heavy on the sesame oil.\n- Ika Wasabi (only part of a set) - This is bits of squid that is marinated in wasabi. If you like squid AND the flavoring of wasabi then this is your jam. We personally enjoyed it.\n- Beef Flank Steak Yakitori (normally $12) - This was great. Very tender and the soy based sauce they have on it is a great combination. Would recommend.\n- Saba Nanban (normally $12) - If you like mackerel then get this. The texture is akin to tuna fish in a can and has a strong fish flavor to it. Again, if you've had saba (mackerel) then you'd enjoy this. I would eat this with rice however to help diffuse the intense flavor.\n- Beef Bi Bim Bap (normally $23) - This comes in a hot stone bowl which is GREAT. The sauce isn't super spicy so feel free to pour it all in and mix it up! The hot stone bowl will give the rice on the bottom a delightful crunchy texture to it. Would get this again (assuming its in a stone bowl).\n- Green Tea Ice Cream Mochi (normally $5) - Good palate cleanser but nothing to write home about.\n\nItems we ordered separately:\n- Pork Belly Yakitori - $7 - Really enjoyed this one as it had a delightful light oil based sauce (with green onions) that helped compliment the pork belly. I would get this one again.\n- Sweet and Sour Chicken - $17 - Sleeper hit with lots of chunks of chicken breast that is well sauced and juicy on the inside with a nice crunch on the outside. Really enjoyed this dish! Comes with a small bowl of white rice.\n\n- Chashu Ramen - $20 - Nice clean broth with noodles that were cooked perfectly. This would be great on a cold day.\n- Zaku Combo Appetizer (9 items) - $27 - This was a fantastic way to try out a little of all their appetizers. This is perfect for sharing with 2 people and everything tasted fantastic!\n-Smoked Salmon and  Yogurt - $5 - This dish is highly recommended. The bread that the smoked salmon and yogurt rested on was delightfully crisp with a nice chew in the middle.\n\nI would highly recommend this establishment with no reservations! I had relatively high expectation as the ratings were pretty high (when I wrote this review it was about 4.9). The food was okay. The ramen was not authentic and the Chashu was not well marinated.  There were better ramen around the area. The bibimbap was a bit expensive but it was not bad. The atmosphere was a bit noisy too. Ive been a SEE Eyewear customer in Glendale for almost five years. I relocated to New England and took a visit to the SEE eyewear on Newberry St.\nAs always the customer service at SEE eyewear is just amazing .\nFrom my eyes being examined by Dr Jimmerson who is so professional and made me feel so comfortable.\nTo Casey ( Coco ) who handled all the particulars\u2026. Coco is amazing, you\u2019ll love her .\nLex is also another super soul in that establishment who just adds to the good vibes at this location.\nThe styles of glasses are unique and exclusive. I\u2019ll definitely be back again to get new specs when the need arises. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a thanks again I love SEE! Patricia and Casey helped me pick out stunning frames that match my style. They are attentive, kind, supportive and compassionate. I do not like shopping but working with them was an enjoyable experience, so instead of getting one pair of glasses, I got two new frames and updated my current frames, all at an affordable price. I can\u2019t say enough about them! Went with my wife all the way from Maine to See after she had visited the store in July with her friends. Patricia who attended us was very helpful with her knowledge and advice about fit and style, very patient at every step, leaving us room to consider and make good decisions. Excellent and fun experience that resulted in 2 cool pairs of glasses. Price is competitive with other high quality stores. The selection of frames covers many unique tastes and styles. My first Google review\u2014extraordinary customer service. Trish and Casey are both incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and skilled. They go out of their way to accommodate customers and make the process a pleasant experience. I love Casey and Patricia at SEE! They have helped me to find the perfect glasses for my style despite having a very strong prescription. I am now wearing glasses that I never knew that could! It\u2019s a family environment in the store, and they know everyone\u2019s name and make you feel very welcome. I don\u2019t (and wouldn\u2019t) buy glasses anywhere else! Horrifying. I went on a Monday when they offer reduced price for \u201cmodel\u201d i had a 230 appointment they asked if i could come in an hour early. And i agreed. 15 minutes into having my foils in the ride bully manager tell all the girls she has to leave and they can\u2019t stay there alone. The girl quickly washes the foils out half my hair was not processed. And tells me \u201cshe\u201d wants you to go pay. I told her i was not paying until my hair was finished. No apology no solutions i had to leave with my hair disaster and wet. She did this to two other clients that i witnessed. And apparently it\u2019s a common practice for her. UNACCEPTABLE!! Salon is in a great neighborhood if you want to shop or have coffee, drinks, a meal after. Salon itself is very clean and well designed.\nBut the best part is the haircut - definitely one of the best haircuts I\u2019ve ever had. I go to Genevieve and my husband\u2019s hair is cut by Janet. Highly recommend both of them. You will walk out feeling chic and pampered. I had an appt on Wednesday for the first time with Nestor on a recommendation from my dear friend! It was amazing- I had really needed someone to just DO SOMETHING! Anyway- the best cut I ever had- and fabulous working my gray into highlights for (I think) a very natural look!!! I am thrilled and cant wait to go back! Lindsay Fabulous haircut from Patrick. I have had my hair cut at several Newbury Street  establishments and Patrick is the best!  Highly recommend Orlando, I will follow you to the end of the earth. That is why I am a client at Marc Harris. This man is truly gifted, humble, funny, a great listener and clearly takes pride in his work. I have been sorely disappointed by many stylist over the years, but I have NEVER been disappointed by Orlando. If I could hop in a jet and go to Orlando whenever I wanted, I would. I've only seen other stylists, because I do not have a jet and it's costly to fly from wherever we're living. He knows my hair and I do not have to explain what I want, since he knows my personality and knows exactly what I want. I don't always feel attractive, however, when I leave his chair, I feel confident. I will use my miles to fly to you soon! Thank you to the BEST stylist in the world! I have no clue why all this bad reviews, i just purchased a bag from this location & Destiny was so helpful a very kind offered us Champagne \ud83e\udd42 definitely will recommend this location to anyone, most likely getting other bag from this location. Customer services from Destiny was Amazing A++++ I bought this one when it was on sale for my GF and she really loves the design and quality with the price. Those ladies in shop were nice that asked me whether pack it as gift. Thank you, I will come again in future. We are from China and Canada. My wife has a liking for Longchamp bags due to simple, good quality design. So when she found out that's one store at Newsbury St, Boston, near where we were staying, she jumped at the opportunity to visit. She managed to get one Le Pilage Original Tote bag for her friend. She was attended to by a male sales person and was very satisfied with his service as he even asked whether to gift wrap the bag.\nMy wife bought a 2nd bag for herself - a Le Pliage Energy L bag (Navy). However, for this 2nd purchase, my wife was greatly disapponted by the attitude & bad service from the female cashier staff at this Newsbury outlet. My wife requested for a second as the first piece has minor defects. It turned out that the second piece is even worse as it has fabric spurs at the handle area. So the next request was to have another new one. The female cashier surprisingly responded that it is very troublesome as she would have to go down the storeroom to get a new one.\nTo avoid any further issue, my wife decided to go back to the first piece. After the purchase, there was not even a simple thank you from the female cashier staff!\nI would strongly not recommend any one going  to this store if nothing is done about the service level of this staff! GREATLY DISAPPOINTED Worst customer experience ever\u2026 ordered a Christmas present for collection- they sent confirmation. When I went to collect they don\u2019t have it, and apparently haven\u2019t had it for months\u2026 when I called customer services they said \u201cthere is nothing I can do - I can\u2019t just magic a bag out of thin air\u201d - well then maybe don\u2019t take my money and tell me you have it ready for collection\u2026 unbelievable incompetence. Their bags are everything! Great quality, variety of sizes and collections.. and good prices. I came in with my daughter over the weekend. The manager told us about the candle making classes and said there were still openings for the 7pm class that day. We jumped on it and were so glad we did! Very fun, easy experience with a wonderful staff. We highly recommend the store, the staff and the class! Great store and concept! I really like the selection of vessels and scents. However, it is a bit pricey for one candle and an hour long session. The majority of the time, there was a store associate explaining the process, about 10 minutes of selecting the scents and wax, and about 10 to 15 minutes of mixing scents and wax. You do need to come back to the store and pick up your candle because it takes a few hours for the candle to set. Overall, a fun activity with groups and very \u201cinstagrammable\u201d. Don\u2019t forget to bring wine! I came in and was greeted so kindly and immediately was able to take a class to pour my own candle! it was such a fun experience and i got to chose everything. absolutely recommend it (: Made our own candles... So much fun! Allie was amazing.  Very cute shop as well Such a great vibe here! The employees were all so nice and very helpful! The classes are so much fun and a great place for a girls night!!! This store has great staff who really can help you choose what might fit and work together. I love when they have special events like photo days to get pictures for linked in or other business profiles. The clothing is great for  professional work and interview but also certain pieces are cool/ funky and combined can make a distinctive style. The price point is  what you would expect for higher quality clothing however the company has various sales and if you order  an online item that is not in the store, through the store staff they can help you on sizing and returns. The store doesn\u2019t always have all the sizes but if you book a styling appointment they can have your size sent to the store if you give enough notice. I very much enjoyed meeting the founder Sarah at an event. Ashli, Angie and other staff all very passionate about style and people. I had a great experience with Angie at MM La Fleur on Newbury St. in Boston.\nAngie is fun, knowledgeable, attentive, understanding, and has a real sense of style.  And she \"listens\"  to why you agree or disagree with her suggestions.  I learned a lot and also was able to purchase just what I needed.  And get some items tailored just as I needed. I will visit again soon.  Thank you, Angie\nAnn  :-) Really great to be working with experts in person  vs shopping on site (picking the wrong sizes, fabrics, etc). Ashley was excellent and the selection wide. Highly recommend making an appt if you are close enough to get to a store! This brand is phenomenal and I am so happy to finally be living in proximity of a physical store. I dropped by to try on some pants because I wasn't sure of my size and was met with amazing customer service and just an overall fabulous experience. Left with two pants which I love and have already gotten compliments (as always happens when wearing their stuff). Could not recommend more highly. I was so happy that M.M.LaFleur reopened their Boston store and visiting in person on opening weekend did not disappoint. Friendly salespeople and of course their clothing has what I have taken to calling the \"MM Magic\" - it's not only high quality but has such incredible attention to detail and fit that it turns into something magical when you put it on (it can look a bit conservative on the shelf). Please never stop doing what you are doing, MM! I was visiting Europe for 7 Weeks. Beautiful place for Vacation. Went to Alps which is apparently the biggest mountains in Europe. We were hiking at the French side of Alps. I had a lot of fun as well as my friends and family It was with joy that I first beheld the Julian Alps, nestled within the Slovenian landscape. The influence that (dare I call it) simple rock can have on the senses, the climate and the resultant habitat, can teach us so much. This is a beautiful wonder of nature, that reminds us of the need for humility and a sense of balanced perspective in life. Amazing landscapes, beautiful mountain chain\u2026 definitely worth visiting any part. I recommend: Swiss, Austria and Italy I was hoping so much my flight from Amsterdam to Florence would pass so close to the Alps.  Like a chump I did not book a window seat but I was so lucky to receive one. For an hour I was treated to the most dazzling view. I got to detach from everything and watch stunning mountains and beautiful valley pass by. I could see the gorgerous rivers and snowy moutain tops and all the scenic mountain towns and villages. A great I'll remember always. Very good place for skiing and sledding, there are many great small towns nearby, one of the ones I was in is Cavalese, a city in the Italian Alps! Eryn, the salesperson who helped me, is very knowledgeable about bra fit and styles. I got a valuable bra fitting, never felt rushed as I tried on various bras. I am not easy to fit, I\u2019m older and large breasted.  I was delighted to find 2 bras with which I am very happy. I highly recommend Wacoal on Newbury Street. I had an amazing experience shopping at Wacoal! Eryn was sooo helpful, I hadn\u2019t been sized or bought a real bra in years (had mostly been wearing bralettes and sports bras) and being able to try on a bunch of bras that actually fit was amazing. If you\u2019ve only ever been \u201csized\u201d at Victoria\u2019s Secret definitely go to Wacoal, you\u2019ll actually get your real size and get bras that fit! I had a great experience shopping with Eryn's assistance. She went above and beyond to ensure I found exactly what I needed, taking the time to understand my preferences and offering valuable advice. As a self-proclaimed \"bra-nerd\", she was able to pinpoint fits that worked or didn't and why.\n\nHer expertise and professionalism made the whole experience comfortable and enjoyable. Thanks to their professional expertise, I was to find what I needed and left feeling confident! Sara at Wacoal on Newbury was so fantastic! She helped mw find the perfect fitting bra (which took a few tries and she was v patient). It\u2019s been so long since I was fitted for a bra that looks incredible and feels great. Thank u Sara!\nStephanie was also wonderful - many thanks to her too! I walked in and didn\u2019t even know what size I was. Eryn helped me out finding my size and some bras that were just what I needed. She was almost as supportive as the bras! I normally hate bra shopping but this was a very positive experience. Jonquils Cafe has been on my Boston list for the longest time. Their innovative cake designs made by 3D printed molds look 100% insta-worthy and are sure to captivate every girl.\n\nHonest thoughts: The cakes were indeed beautifully crafted, but $13 was overpriced. The cake quality didn\u2019t meet the steep price. The cafe was self-service and some furnitures were quite worn out.\n\nFrom their ig, I saw the price tag was ~$9 last year. It was aggressive to raise $4 within a year\u2026..It would be more reasonable to charge at or under $10.\n\n\uff0aAutumn Leaf $13 *\nThis seasonal special was my favorite. Spiced sponge and pecan crunch were wrapped inside the subtly sweet maple mousse, with a hint of banana flavor coming through midway. The spiced cake tasted like fall.\n\n\uff0aGeometric Apple $13\nThe geometric apple is their bestseller but I found the flavors didn\u2019t match well with one another. The outer layer was cheesecake mousse, while the center was filled with apple compote, caramel, and chocolate cake. The cake was quite sweet, and the sourness from apple put me off. The chocolate crunch inside was too hard to eat. Jonquils Cafe is a pastry shop & cafe well known for their pastries that are designed to look like 3D printed creations.\n\nThe shop is decently sized, with many open seating. The staff are pretty friendly, able to explain what is in each of the products.\n\nAs for the products, the pastries were quite good. They weren't too heavy, and the fillings used were tasty and went well with the rest of the pastry. The portion is alright for the price, but the quality stands out. Overall a nice place to visit and check out if you are in the area. The apple was amazing, the lemon twist was amazing and the scone was delicious. We didn't like the rose but the coffe made up for up. 10/10 would eat here again Jonquils cafe offers a very cozy environment with some very unique pastries. Their geometrical pastries are really interested and tasted great, but the $13 price tag on a small pastry like that is a bit too much. Additionally, the chocolate piece inside was too hard which made it more difficult to eat. Their cappuccino was good. It's definitely worth going to try the pastries once, but that's it. Saw this Cafe n Pastry in Newbury. Many of the pastries were geometric shaped and delightful to see. Tried the geometric apple cake which was quite good. The coffee was ok. The cafe has both indoor and outdoor seating. Prices for the pastries were on the high side for the small piece. Such a cute little bookstore right next to a wonderful caf\u00e9. It was so nice to be able to browse and they had lots of different varieties of books. They have it all laid out in the front which is so easy to read and look at all the titles. It was almost like looking at title cover art collage. They also had a children\u2019s section with lots of games and little do hickeys and it was all very cute and fun. It was a nice place to look at some trinkets and look at what books to buy next. Lovely place. Ok... so hear me out. I came in on my last day at home in Boston. I wanted to get to at least 1 Independent bookstore while I was there and the famous one in Beacon Hill was closed on Mondays so off to Yelp I went to find another in the vicinity.\n\nThis one was closing in 15 minutes so I drove like a bat outta hell and got there in time to walk in and overhear Caroline (one of the booksellers) discussing some options to a patron. Confession time... I LOVE eavesdropping on book conversations (it's the bibliophile in me) anyhoo very cute bookstore. They also have stationary, bibliophile gift items, literary candles, a kids section and extensive offerings of the Penguin classics deluxe editions new covers. Oh yea they also have a small \"Blind Date with a Book\" shelf too!\n\nI will tell you this though - when they say they are closing they are CLOSING they give multiple gentle warnings before the voice becomes sterner in their guidance for you to wrap it up and make your purchases. I wasn't offended and pushed out I know what it feels like to want to get out of work.\n\nNext time I'll come with ample time and post more recent photos.\n\nRespectfully Reviewed. Store itself is cute, it\u2019s the staff that ruined my experience. Tonight 12/9/24, I went to the register to pay for my items, the three girls did not even acknowledge me, she took my items, and  kept talking to her other co workers about \u201csomeone in my class legit smelt like poo poo\u201d. I legit can\u2019t even make this up lol. Granted these girls were probably no more than college age, but so am I, and I was still shocked at the unprofessionalism. The Disney channel music booming over the speaker when I walked in was already annoying, but the swearing and conversation about \u201cpoo-poo\u201d that could\u2019ve been heard from 3 blocks away was just too much. Nice store, but it\u2019s a dime a dozen. The cutest bookstore ever! I love this little place. Has different genres of books for both adults and children, as well as the most adorable dolls, also has cards and mugs and magnets, puzzles and toys for kids... A special place definitely worth visiting. Beautiful store with lots of cute gifts for when you don't know what to get someone. My favorite part was the handwritten book reviews. LOVED my experience working with The Rug Company. Beautiful contemporary designs woven with high quality craftsmanship. Mary and the rest of the sales team were a pleasure to work with! The rugs they helped us to select completely transformed our home, we couldn't be happier. High quality rugs with beautiful selection of styles... designed by artists, fashion icons and more. Ability to customize is a bonus. Excellent service by this friendly team as well. Horrible experience would not recommend them to anyone, there employees are rude and not mature , and the rugs are expensive and very cheaply made\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb Nordstrom Rack is definitely a great place for shopping! It\u2019s a treasure trove of good brands at reduced prices, making it perfect for finding quality items without breaking the bank.\n\nThey have an amazing variety\u2014bags, sunglasses, cosmetics, clothes, shoes, and so much more. Whether you're hunting for a stylish accessory or updating your wardrobe, there\u2019s something for everyone here.\n\nThe deals are fantastic, and the selection is always impressive. If you love high-quality products at low prices, Nordstrom Rack is the place to go! I love shopping at this store one because they have great clothing and my size shoes. The other reason is because the customer service. I receive in the store every time, but especially from Jackson. At the register, complete gentleman very clear, very kind. It's very helpful. Thanked me by name because I was using my card. But took the time to acknowledge me, and there was a young lady named Yvonne, she was helping out. It seemed like her other team members without being asked really was being of assistance. It seemed like she wasn't thinking of herself, but she was there to make sure everything ran smoothly. I hope that I see her on the wall. Like I see in other stores for other employees that she is employee of the month because she seemed pretty amazing. I think kindness, teamwork and communication are the top 3 characteristics to have to be employee of the month. And I definitely feel Yvonne, deserves it. I was at the store on November 24th a Sunday, around 7 PM. And they both were working on the 1st floor. I really do hope that the manager get this review and acknowledges there efforts and lets everyone know I always have fun browsing in this store. I have found some great work clothes at reasonable prices. They also have a big shoe department, a good selection of handbags, accessories, cosmetics, and home goods!\nNice staff and easy returns if something doesn't work out. Decent clothing selection, not too much for skincare deals. Watch out for juniors sizes that are the opposite of vanity sizing \ud83d\ude02 Good retails shop to buy brand good for less. It contains sections for men, women and kids. Nice deals on jackets and shoes. It needs more staff as there are long queues for payment. You need to spend long time to go through the good to Fing your request. It is a good place to find designer bags for less , like Kate spade and Marc Jacobs and MK . Also different shoe brands for less . Highly recommended for shopping I recently had  visited Webster Bank at Bolyston street, Boston Ligiya M. Barsegyan, a senior relationship banker at Webster Bank, and I must say that her customer service was truly exceptional. Ligiya was professional, friendly, and went above and beyond to help me with my banking needs. She took the time to understand my financial goals and provided personalized recommendations that were tailored to my specific situation. Her communication was clear and effective, and she was always available to answer any questions I had.\n\nI was particularly impressed with Ligiya's ability to explain complex financial concepts in a way that was easy to understand. She was patient and took the time to ensure that I was comfortable with the solutions she proposed. Her dedication to providing excellent customer service was evident throughout the entire process.\n\nI highly recommend Ligiya and Webster Bank for anyone looking for top-notch banking services. They truly understand the meaning of customer service and go above and beyond to ensure that their clients are satisfied.\n\nThank you, Ligiya, for your exceptional service! My experience at this bank as been more than 5 stars!! Djalal Khoulani is one of the bankers at this location and he is always professional, knowledgable, experienced and gets me in & out of there as quickly as possible.  I highly recommend this branch to all. They make you feel like family! DO NOT BUY YOUR GIFTS AT SEPHORA!!!! They changed their return policy so even with a gift receipt your friends won\u2019t be able to return any makeup that doesn\u2019t work for them if you purchased it >30 days before they tried it and got around to returning it. Buy it from Nordstrom instead they have an AMAZING return policy for gifts. Staff looks sweet and friendly.  I was only puzzled that they didn't bag your purchase. My kid had to pick up her bottles ($100+). My thinking is only if customer asking no bag otherwise bagging the purchase is very essential. You don't want your customer to ask you to bag their stuff, don't you? OMG I TOOK MY WIFE FOR A MAKEUP IN THERE STUDIOO UFF STAFF THERE IS VERY VERY AWSOME  ALLOT ALLOT OF PEOPLE BUT THEY HAVE EVERYTHING IN THERE FOR MAKEUP\n\nYOU WANNA AWSOME MAKE UP THE BEST STYLIST MYIESHA LOOK AT THE PICTURE SHE EVEN WROTE TU US ON THE PORTAL SHE IS SUCH A  WONDERFUL YOUNG LADY. I'm giving a 3 solely based off Myiesha. She was super informative and very welcoming and kind. We walked in and were not greeted by the person up front. 2-3 people who saw us standing there didn't even offer us help. Most of the staff was literally walking through us no \"excuse me\" nothing. Like we were chopped liver/irrelevant. Myiesha instantly spotted us and helped us with all of needs and answered our questions in full detail and giving alternatives for items not in the store. I never have pleasant experiences at Sephora anyway so I'm not surprised that this was no different. I will not be back unless Myiesha is working. I can never shop at places that are not welcoming. Lynn at Sephora was very helpful and showed me how to apply concealer as well as Fenty beauty mocha stick. She walked me through every step very patiently and was very patient with me. She also helped me reorder a previous mascara. Further, since they were out of mocha stick, she shipped it to my house. She is very nice and friendly and I highly suggest working with her. She has great makeup recommendations and she suggested a lip liner from Sephora (both color and type) as I was in market for one. She also suggested me a brush by Sephora which blends extremely well due to its size. Caroline at the store was also very nice and helped me with purchase of point liner black color by O/S brand. The store has a great vibe and people are overall very helpful and friendly. They are a bit understaffed though on a Saturday afternoon. The bathroom is extremely clean and serene. Convenient location with great style selection and helpful staff. They also have really good deals several times a year, and if you apply for them, they send you some really amazing coupons in the mail I've taken advantage of quite a few times. The quality of bras is always great, mine have lasted for years without hardly budging. The one negative thing I'll say about Victoria's Secret as a whole is that they don't have a whole lot of styles available once you go pas a 36DD, let alone a 38D or 38DD. But if you're in the size range below that, plenty of options in some really gorgeous styles. Great attention from the moment you step inside the store. If you need help they'll kindly walk you through the store and advised you about whatever you are looking for.\nA really professional care, focusing of making a good customer experience.\nTotally recommend it. About COVID safety's, everyone wears a face mask and have antibacterial available for you at anytime. My friend and I love the semi-annual sale and visit twice a year. We arrived at 7:10 hoping to have plenty of time to shop, since GOOGLE lists closing time at 9:00. Promptly at 7:15, the music was cut so everyone had to shop in awkward silence. We heard one employee tell another shopper \"we close in ten minutes\" when she asked for a bag (which they had put behind the register to deter anyone from shopping!) This is how we learned they close at 8. I've worked in retail stores my whole life and I'd be fired for turning the music off 45 minutes in advance and creating such an unwelcoming environment. Furthermore, while I was checking out my (very large, not that it matters) purchase, the woman helping me said at full volume so everyone in line could hear, \"WHY are people still shopping?\" It was 7:55. I replied, \"because you're still open.\" She told me she wasn't referring to me, and I said, \"it doesn't matter, your store is open and making people feel uncomfortable and unwelcome is not nice.\" She just continued to package my stuff at a glacial pace. The girl next to her forgot to put my friend's beauty products in her bag. Maybe if she and her coworkers worked with more enthusiasm and energy they would be closing on time and making more sales. I will not visit this location again. The staff is extremely helpful and the clothing is great and it is definitely worth the extra expense. The clothing there will last you a lot longer than places with cheaper options. However I would wait for sales or deals. The full priced items are not cheap. Not crowded at all. Very comfortable for shopping. It was a pity that the discount campaign was for American citizens only. But overall was still a good shopping experience! We had a fantastic shopping experience! They offer a variety of high-end brands like Vivienne Westwood and Open YY. The service was friendly and attentive, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. We\u2019ll definitely be coming back for more! Absolutely love this place! The service was very sweet and gave some awesome recommendations on styles and types of materials for the bags I ended up buying. I got an awesome Vivienne Westwood bag and a limited edition Marge Sherwood bag and will definitely be returning to see what they have in the coming weeks! I purchased OSOI hobo bag here and left the store really satisfied. They got chill vibe with good music mix, friendly customer services, and most importantly, have great collection. Check out this place when you come to Newbury st. Very nice customer service! Found exactly what I want. There\u2019s many size in all the clothing from what you\u2019ll see at the store. Beautiful store on Newbury Street! High fashion brands and their special pieces. Found a very nice ring here. Also, very nice customer service. Definitely recommend if you like fashion! We love the tea in this place very tasteful as well as employees are super helpful Very stylish place. They have a good design in tea cups and bottles. Worth checking out! Nice store. Their flavors are really cool although somewhat pricey I found some nice new flavors of loose tea in some great travel packaging. The team was super nice and helpful. This store is beautifully designed to give you the best tea experience. There are so many different kinds to choose from and they have very unique and stylish tea diffuser options. Perfect place to pick up a gift! If you've never had Tea Fort\u00e9, you're missing out! Ask for Alicia when you are there, she was great and very knowledgeable! And you get plenty of free samples of course! I went to get measured today and the staff was SOOOOOO nice! Melody and Axl were super, super careful in taking the measurements perfectly, explained every single customization to me and helped me with the decisions. Atmosphere is also very nice, calm and comfy! I can't wait for my suit to get home and I already want to come back for more. I highly recommend this place! The initial measurement went okay. The store is definitely more oriented towards men\u2019s suits than women\u2019s/unisex. When the suit came, the measurements were pretty close except the silhouette didn\u2019t account for my height and was way too long. The pants were spot on. When I went into my final fitting appointment, we determined that the jacket needed to be re-made. The employee assisting with the refit was very knowledgeable.\n\nDefinitely order with plenty of time for adjustments and possible re-do. The fabric was true to the swatch and the liner felt premium. I would definitely work with this company again. I recently did my shopping for a wedding suit here with Maggie & Alex (I believe), and they were excellent.  They had such a great vibe and energy to them and made the entire experience fun and stress-free.  Would recommend. It was a good experience. We bought a 3 piece suit for a reception. Esxiel and the lady there helped us a lot with the size ,measurement and designs. Totally recommend it. After visiting the Seaport location and feeling like the staff didn\u2019t seem interested in helping me without an appointment, I decided to make an appointment at the Newbury Street location. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience.\n\nEsxiel and the rest of the staff were fantastic. They made the entire process seamless, from the initial measurements to the final suit assembly. They crafted the suit I had been looking for, it looked and felt great.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely return to their store the next time I need a suit. They truly nailed it! Recently had a great experience getting fitted for my wedding tuxedo and rehearsal dinner jacket at Alton Lane on Newbury St. Julian was amazing throughout the whole process. He's super passionate, knowledgeable, and overall very helpful. Always appreciate a salesperson that does a great job asking questions, getting to know us better, and seeking to better understand our vision in order to better guide us on choices along the way. 5/5 stars, will definitely be back, and totally recommending to friends! Bought my father a gift card from Alton lane for his birthday. We really enjoyed the experience and Julian\u2019s energy and attention to detail was refreshing. I was a bit apprehensive searching for my first suit since formal blazers/jackets do not typically fit me very well. I also had a super tight time frame with a wedding 2.5-3 weeks away. I ended up having a great experience at Alton Lane! Johnny was incredible, he made me feel very welcome and comfortable when I don't usually feel that way looking for formal clothes, and he gave great advice about styling and did a fantastic job fitting me when I first came in, so much so that the suit needed zero adjustments when it came in. The suit was ready in just a week and 4 days! I would definitely recommend Alton Lane to anyone, and I now have a beautiful suit that fits me better than I ever expected. I greatly appreciated the time Claire took with me to design my first custom blazer. Claire and the Alton Lane team have great attention to detail and an extensive variety of options to personalize your look. Highly recommend. Atmosphere is really cool and the personal dedicated attention from the staff is like none-other. I had always got suits at your traditional larger suit warehouses, but for my wedding, I wanted something different and custom to me. Alton Lane did just that. I was extremely satisfied with my suit and it fit perfect. Yes it was more money than a \"typical\" suit, but you get exactly what you pay for. Really recommend this place. Just make sure you order with enough time before your event as it does take a little bit since everything is totally custom and you may still end up needing them to slightly adjust things when it comes in, so account for that on the back end. It\u2019s no surprise that this salon consistently earns \"Best of Boston\" awards. I was introduced to Patrice Vince by a trusted professional in the hair care industry, and I\u2019ve been a loyal client for nine years. A huge thank you to Jordania and Luke for making my red hair look natural, healthy, and full of life \u2013 I get compliments on it all the time!\n\nTony and Danny at the front desk are always incredibly helpful, and every stylist here is highly skilled and experienced. It\u2019s a top-tier team all around! I have been seeing Chuck Bass for years and he is now at Patrice Vinci Salon! Award winning hair stylist does not so this man justice. He is a hair magician and has transformed my thin, flat hair to one full of lift and body. I cannot even tell you how many have commented on how thick my hair looks. If you are looking for the best when it comes to having your hair cut and styled, look no more! I have been struggling with my hair for 20 years.  I travel an hour to see Patrice.  Worth every minute! If you have any hair issue AT ALL, go see Jess! She is amazing and gives so much attention to detail. Beyond her amazing haircuts, she is just lovely to chat with and so warm and funny. Luke is the best stylist I have ever been to. I am typically super nervous about getting my hair done but he made me feel so comfortable and gave me the best color/cut/and blowout I\u2019ve ever had. The blowout lasted for almost a week and the cut was the most beautifully layered haircut Ive ever had. Im so excited to have my hair done by him again. Beautiful store and great new styles for holiday 2024. I'm not sure if it was a manager who helped me with finding some sizes after perusing the whole store for fun but she was great to work with! So patient with me and I could tell she cared I had a good experience at Ralph Lauren even though the store was busy and I could tell she was checking on me, other customers, and her team. Highly recommend Ralph Lauren and their Newbury St store!! Nice shop, but what's wrong with that guy on the first floor? It's disappointing to see from other reviews that I\u2019m not the only one who felt treated poorly. This really impacts the brand and customer experience. I hope you address this issue to ensure better interactions with your customers. The space formula that works so well in other cities feels claustrophobic to me here. The store looks like a midsize hallway that doesn't motivate clients to explore any further. And totally lacks a caf\u00e9 or similar. Awesome store with stellar customer service.  Thank you, Sonia Ibrahim for all your help and your amazing customer centric focus. I truly enjoyed my visit here.  This is a beautiful shop!. I work with Anthony. Love the curated Double RL selection. Great service and style. Love Simon Pearce. Been to this store twice over the holiday season. Both times found the bald associate with glasses to be quite rude and dismissive. Other associates are great. Simon Pearce on Newbury Street is a beautiful showroom. This is a must go and see!! And if you like adventures, travel to the Vermont location. You will not be disappointed. Beautiful store with wonderful handmade glass and pottery products. Nice place to get a gift. Helpful knowledgeable staff great store great experience Beautiful handmade products Natalie! Where do I even begin \ud83d\ude0d I have never felt safer with my skin in anyone else's hands! She puts her mind and heart into everything she does! Incredibly knowledgeable about health, skin, and products. Every time I think I'll explore and try a different product I waste my money b/c my skin only likes hers! She is a living example of what it looks and feels like to invest yourself. She looks just like Elsa from Disney's Frozen! Natalie is top tier professional which can make one so relaxed that you could fall asleep while getting a facial! I have been with Natalie for over 10 years. Unique verve is one of the special things I've collected in my life as a favorite. If you're looking for the best facial of your life, look no further. I have quite a few over the years in Boston that also had great recommendations and reviews but none have come close to the experience I have had at Unique Verve. The experience itself is relaxing and impactful. Every time I leave, my skin is glowing, clear, and even looks lifted. I have had the best lasting effects with these facials and would go way more if I could. I always try to make an appointment when/if I get a tax return or bonus at work because it's well worth every penny.  Natalie is a master at her craft and is extremely knowledgable. I won't go anywhere else. Highly highly recommended. Natalie's functional medicine program helped me to eliminate the GI discomfort that I have been experincing for many years.  The dietary changes that she suggested helped me to lose more than 30 lbs.  I feel better, less fatiqued and my reduced weight has relieved some of the pain and swelling I had in my knees. Unique Verve has been a Godsent for me and my family. I began taking supplements back in October of 2023 and have seen a world of difference in my skin, hair, energy levels, and overall feeling. I recommended them to my father who started a comprehensive functional medicine program about two months ago. We have already seen a vast improvement in his overall health and have seen how knowledgeable Natalie is in all areas. We are confident we came to the right place.\n\nI have been recommending Unique Verve to friends and family and will definitely continue to! Thank you Unique Verve! Natalie is amazing . I am doing the microchaneling face and neck with her  and I can see the results already and she still have two more sesi\u00f3ns to go plus taking pharmaceutical grade vitamins that she recommend me and my skin looks so nice and plump .. so happy with my results . Thank you so much Natalie \u2764\ufe0f My wife bought a System Tote 13-inch, and it's a high-quality work bag. It features a secure top zip to keep everything safe and has enough space for a laptop and other essentials. Plus, its stylish design makes it a great choice for work. I posted a negative review a while ago, that the leathers were separating. Got an email from Cuyana  that they stand by their products and want to make it right. As soon as they found out the bag was older than two years, they wouldn\u2019t do anything. Good leather bags should last longer than two years with normal use. This is definitely an inferior product, their mantra of better quality is laughable. Excellent quality bags and leather goods. They've recently opened this brick & mortar store, but I've been an online customer for years. Definitely not inexpensive, but a good value for the quality, imo. Amazing quality and design for very reasonable prices. Fantastic customer service! Toni and the Manager, Susana, were absolutely wonderful and patient in helping me with my purchases. I had such a great experience. I had a wonderful dress buying experience at Betsy Jenney.  Janeth was thoughtful about what she showed me but I didn't see anything the day I dropped by.  A few days later, she texted a picture of dress that she thought would be perfect, held it for me, and that was the dress!  Friends loved it and I felt great wearing it!  Robin Wonderful, curated collection of sophisticated casual and evening wear from small American, European, and Latin designers. Top notch customer service without high pressure to buy. My favorite place to shop in Boston and Newton! Different---wonderful styles and selection---everything from every day to very fancy; great jewelry too. Lots of personal attention. Nice work I went online Saturday night to find the shoes i wanted were sold out, i callled the Newbury St store to see if they had them and they were so helpful. Great customer service. My shoes came yesterday and they are gorgeous. Thank you to the staff at Newbury Street store! Worst buying experience of my LIFE! My wife had bought a shoe from them, changed her mind a few days later and tried to return it. The only thing they agreed to was store credit, AND we should use it the same day as the return!! So now I decided to use that store credit to buy something online, but I can't. Seems like you can only use it in store!! Went to the store, they only had 2 kinds of men's shoes! Explained the situation, they said OK we'll buy it online for you, from the store! What?? By then, my size was gone. They couldn't even pre-order it! Tried the store a few weeks later when my size was available again. Now they are telling me that they can't order anything online till they sell their restock or whatever!! What the actual ****! Asked for a refund. Nope. Asked for a store credit so I can buy online. Nope. Asked for the manager. Turns out she is the manager (one of the two people in the store!). Then she threatens to call the cops??? Please do not buy from these pieces of garbage. If I could give zero stars I would. Do not spend money or order anything at this store! If they mess up your order, instead of handling the situation with respect, the manager was a huge jerk and went out of her way to make sure I knew that nothing would be done to correct my order. She was incredibly unprofessional and so rude, I was appauld. They are 100% not worth the money when there are plenty of other great shoes stores that actually treat their cutoms well and own up to their own mistakes! Stay far away! They helped us in a very polite, fast and effective way. We ended up buying 3 pair of shoes because of that. Kudos to the team in this location , great customer service! Love this store. Manager Sonia was great always and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Will miss this location Just went here and Ty was super helpful and welcoming even though the store was closing.  He was able to resolve our phone issue quickly and with a smile. I have had some issues over the years with t mobile and if there were more employee's like him I would certainly recommend  this carrier to others This t-mobile is amazing I loved it. I will be referring all my friends and family to this location. John and Sam where great I came in to upgrade and they helped me out and saved me tons of money on my bill. Great job t-mobile you hired the right team on Newbury st. I don\u2019t often write reviews of stores or services but felt compelled to write this as the staff at the T-Mobile Store on Newberry were incredible.  Sean and Jadelis at the T-Mobile store on Newberry were both professional, trustworthy, very knowledgeable of the deals available, and went out of their way to be as helpful as they possibly could.  I\u2019d highly recommend the T-Mobile store on Newberry and Sean and Jadelis from the store as they were exceptional. Team Newbury is the bomb! Tai, Ahmed, Anthony, Sean, they are your best people! What an amazing experience I have here every time, wow!\n\nSeems like every time I visit here I leave with a bag! They tell me, \"Why buy an $800 phone when you could get 16 Invisible Shield Tempered Glass?\" and I say \"Good point, slide my card!\" They tell me, \"Customers save hundreds of dollars a year with our Home Internet and T-Vision Bundle,\" and I say, \"Woah, sign me up!\"\n\nThey're doing the Lord's work down there at Newbury, I tell ya. I think I saw a card on the table that had this lady's name, \"Janeen\" on it, is she the District Manager for this location? If she is reading this, let me tell you, the salespeople at this location, they are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Time and time again I have received excellent service at this location. That guy Tai, especially, he should be running the place! Seems like I always see him darting around from table to table, answering everyone's questions. And another one there, Ahmed, is it? He is always offering to do a bill review and get me something half off, and such! And they're always saying, thanks for your loyalty to T-Mobile!\n\nIf you asked one of them, \"do you know who Karen Spinetti is, she was raving about you?\" They probably couldn't answer. Because they treat every customer with the same amazing service no matter who they happen to be. If you are reading this, Janeen, you ought to be letting these folks run some stores, get them trained, I think they're ready! Very rude store manager!\n\nI bought a dress on sale in store and went home and checked its price online. I found out they charged me more. I called the store and talked to Lia and she told me: we are so sorry please stop by in our store with the actual receipt and we refund you. Also, she told me after 14 days we cannot refund you, but we can give you a store credit.\nI stopped by after a week with my actual receipt, but the manager of the store told me unfortunately we cannot refund you, because we need the actual item for security purposes. She was so rude and unprofessional. I told her I don\u2019t have the item with me, but this lady, who did check out for me she remembered me and she said that yes, I remember you and the dress you bought. Again, the manager was saying we cannot refund you.\nShe was so crazy I told her I will stay in the store until you refund me, go and talk to your manager. Otherwise I report this one as fraud and I don\u2019t have time to come back again because the mistake you DID it!\n\nIt was ridiculous they did mistake and charged me more and they refused to refund me.\n\nI told the manager look: this is my receipt and in that shows my credit card I will give you my credit card and my ID, why you need the Item maybe I gave that dress to my friend as a gift.\n\nFinally, she refunded my money back but took me 1 hour.\n\nSo, I will never shop again there. You can find much better quality and very good customer service (not dealing with a crazy manager) in other brands such as Brooks Brothers, Banana republic, and Ann Taylor. Unlike some of the reviews I read, staffs were helpful in finding what I wanted (a new staff at this store). However, their selection of apparels for men was somewhat limited as I couldn't find most of the new arrivals I saw online. Ended up purchasing just one piece but definitely not the best Reiss store I've been to. I always had good experiences with Reiss in UK and was excited when Reiss opened on Newbury St in Boston. I shopped there a few times last year with no issue but suddenly everything changed with my recent experience in the Boston store this year. There seemed to be some change in management and people working there. I recently purchased a big order from this store in January with 2 pants that needed tailoring. This store sent me to their partner tailor shop on Newbury St to get things tailored (mistake #1). After arriving to the tailor shop, employees over there told me Reiss was not following agreed procedure (sounded like many Reiss customers were sent to the tailor shop there by mistake). Instead of asking Reiss customers to go to tailor shop, Reiss should have done the measurement at its own store and sent measurement and garments to the tailor shop. I called Reiss to explain the situation and employee at Reiss got on the call with folks at tailor shop and agreed to let us do measurement at the tailor shop and Reiss would contact us when everything is ready to be picked up at its store. Weeks passed with no communication what so ever (mistake #2). We decided to call Reiss to see what the deal was. Employees at Reiss told us there was delay and once everything is ready they would contact us. At their request, I even sent in my order number to their email inbox. Another week passed with no phone calls or anything (mistake #3). Finally today we called in the morning and were told the tailor gave our clothes to the wrong customer and Reiss found 2 new pieces but would need to do tailor at its shop. We agreed to come in to do measurement today and was willing to dismiss all the delays we experienced thus far. When we got to the store, they only had 1 piece with the WRONG SIZE and wasn't aware of the other piece (mistake #4). WHAT THE HECK?!  At this point I stopped counting their mistakes. From what I can tell... employees at this store showed NO customer service whatsoever ...they showed no EMPATHY to us. They were NOT APOLOGETIC to start with, and when they did apologize it was very PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE. I was in the store for over 40 mins trying to figure stuff out with employees over there. During this entire time, NO ONE offered us water or even a place to sit. They have a Keurig machine there with no K cup, empty cups and glasses with no water. I watched a family with kids asking for water, and the employee there showed little interest in getting water for them. The male employee was like... \"so how many cups do you need\". It was so PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE. It made the dad of the family felt bad and said if it's too much trouble, let's forget about water even though the kids were clearly thirsty!! Three employees were there tonight. The male employee was wondering around to the degree I thought he was a customer first. While I was discussing my issue with the other 2 female employees, he finally walked over but during the entire >40 mins said only 3 sentences. The tall brunette was helpful and agreed to get me water when I asked for it. The other female employee was so passive aggressive to the degree I don't even know how to interact with her. She would say she's sorry but I could tell she didn't mean it. She asked us to be calm and lower our voices but i knew she was worried about impacting other customers and not making the sales... but if that's the case, shouldn't she offer us a place somewhere quiet to talk and to sit? This store offers no customer service. Throughout the process, I felt like I had to do all the heavy lifting to get things sorted out (e.g. calling stores to get updates when they clearly promised to call back but never did).\nI don't blame REISS for losing my garments. It was really the customer experience on how they handled everything that made me really question their customer service & brand. At this point,I don't  think I ever want to shop there or let my friends and family shop there. I really hope they prove me wrong but i have 0 confidence in them solving this situation they created. Been shopping here for years and finally getting around to a review.  While the selection can be limited because the Boston store is small, I always find things I love here.\n\nPeople always ask where I get my clothes and it\u2019s always the same answer: REISS! Love the clothing, but this store never has ac. was miserable and uncomfortable just to walk around in it This is one of the best stores I have visited. They were very helpfual and very polite. If I did not see what I wanted on the floor, they went to the back to look fir it or they went online to see if it was available.  They also sent all if my items back to Florida for me, free of charge and I really appreciated that, because my suitcase was already over the weight limit. Lol! Thanks again and I will be back! I love the Lilly Pulitzer brand.  Have so many dresses.  HOWEVER, their customer service is HORRIBLE.  While there is a number posted, you can't get through.  You get cut off with a message encouraging you to write an email, no one answers for days.  They have a chat bot, forget about getting anywhere with that.  I wanted to \"exchange\" a dress I bought . . . but I guess there is no way to do that.  I have to RETURN and then rebuy.  I would think if I am spending over $200 on one item, I could get a live person to talk with.  So so disappointed. Lilly is sadly going down hill in quality. I used to love buying stuff from them and admit I have bought a lot in the past, but lately it\u2019s all cheap fabric from China.  Since the stuff was on sale and they wouldn\u2019t accept returns,  I tried to reuse the fabric to make stuff (masks) and resell, and their general counsel came down hard on me for reusing the fabric I paid for. Unfortunately it\u2019s now trash. Very sad. Love Lily Pulitzer and have been to many of their stores and have always had very positive experiences; however, the Newbury Street Boston location has awful customer service. I think you actually have to try to be that rude to customers / people in general. Staff was incredible rude and unhelpful.  Love the merchandise, but SO disappointed by service!  Also, hours are listed wrong here! The store is only open until 6. As a Finnish design lover, I was absolutely delighted to find out there was a Marimekko in Boston as I was visiting.\n\nThe store is beautiful, elegant and very much reminded me of the Marimekko @ Helsinki Esplanadi in Helsinki, Finland. I spent almost an hour in the store, the ladies there were all absolutely wonderful and will give you great advise on how to beautify your home with this brand\u2019s elegant design. Mia was so wonderful, her recommendations for the fabric for me to use as a table cloth for my home blows me away! \ud83e\udd70 In this day and age, customer service is key to success and Mia and her crew have really done that. I will definitely be back there again. I was having a nice day on Newbury Street when it started raining so I went into this store to look for an umbrella. Products were nice, but service was terrible. Because I was wet and didn't look super polished I tried treading carefully around the store. My hair was messed up because of the rain and I looked a bit dissheveled. Hence the need for an umbrella. Staff were unfriendly and when I smiled at one of them she looked me up and down and sneered at me as she walked by, giving off an arrogant, pompous air about her. I decided to take my business elsewhere if that's how they treat someone looking for an umbrella. Sorry I don't wear expensive clothing. Was just a college kid looking for an umbrella. I love Marimekko designs and home goods but I'll stick to buying online instead of this store. Poor service particularly the staff are very unfriendly and just follow you around. It's very uncomfortable I needed some fabric to make some pajama pants. Plain cotton fabric was $52 a yard! It's highway robbery. I ran over to Chinatown and got the same fabric for $3.99 a yard. This place is a rip off. People here are really nice:) good experience. I would absolutely recommend All-Fit Tailoring for wedding dress alterations! Binh's work is pristine and she is incredibly knowledgeable about working with different fabrics and bustles. Brides - definitely make sure to factor the cost of alterations into your overall budget, and don't skimp on a good tailor for such an important dress! I had a great experience having my wedding dress tailored at All-fit. I bought my dress from Vows, and All-fit was one of their recommended tailors. I needed my dress bustled, hemmed, and I also needed some more coverage on the top; she seamlessly integrated some of the applique from the hem onto the bodice. It\u2019s clear that they are experts & professionals, I felt like I was in good hands the whole time! AVOID THIS PLACE at all costs!!! I never write reviews, but felt the need to warn other brides about this place. This has hands down been the most stressful experience of wedding planning and my biggest regret was not walking away when she quoted me $1400 total for minimal alterations in the first place.\n\nI went to All-Fit based on recommendations from a friend. My dress was used and already altered, needing minimal work per Binh (shortening straps only). I have a second part of my dress, a skirt overlay consisting of a single layer of fabric that needed the waist in, hem and bustle, which was going to cost over $1100, more than the cost of the overlay itself. She also told me I had NO time and needed to decide that day on alterations even though I was still >3 months out from my wedding. I felt extremely pressured and walked out after paying with instant regret. After talking with my wedding planner who told me these prices were outrageous, I tried to cancel 2 days later, as they have a 2 week cancellation policy on the website.\n\nBinh tells me she has already started working on the alterations. While I was disappointed that she was not honoring her cancellation policy, I agreed to pay for the work started as she was recommended to me for her high quality work ($850 for hemming my skirt and taking the waist in). I request to pick up my dress (work was not started on the dress), but tell her to take her time on the skirt alterations. She tells me to pick it up later that week. I paid her the full amount for these alterations and return home to find the waist was LEFT UNDONE with the seams unraveling and a TEAR in the fabric (see photos). Furthermore, the waist wasn't even taken in enough and also needs to be redone!! I find it completely unacceptable that she charges exorbitant prices and produces shoddy and unfinished work.\n\nI just took my dress to another local tailor who is charging 1/4 the price for way more alterations to my actual dress to make it fit better (which Binh told me would be \"too expensive\"), as well as fixing the unfinished waist on my skirt and doing the bustle. This tailor also pointed out that the hem that was completed on my skirt is uneven.\n\nWhile Binh ultimately gave me a partial refund for the unfinished work after I disputed it, this whole experience has been one of the most negative interactions I've ever had with a business. DO NOT trust this woman, especially with the most expensive and important dress of your life. I got fitted for my wedding dress at a dress shop, but when my dress arrived in the size they recommended, it was way too big. I knew that it would need extensive alterations to look the way I had imagined. The shop recommended All-Fit Tailoring, so I took the dress to them to see what they could do. Many many alterations were needed (the seamstress joked that she was basically making me a new dress!), but the result was PERFECT. If you're looking for a trusted tailor to do your wedding dress alterations, this is the place!! Binh and the team at All-Fit tailoring are absolutely wonderful. I had my wedding gown and reception dress altered with them. As anyone can imagine, the thought of tailoring your wedding attire is a stressful one. Upon the first appointment, my anxiety was instantly washed away - Binh is warm and attentive. It is clear that her and the teams\u2019 decades of experience has resulted in a meticulous attention to detail and an expertise in complex fabrics and garment construction. She answered every question we had, we never felt rushed despite their busy schedule, and she never shied away from suggesting even the most minor of tweaks to make sure the garments were perfect. I felt beautiful and confident on my wedding day, thanks to Binh and her team. I can\u2019t recommend them enough. My Bulthaup kitchen is my favorite room in the house. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to move and leave it behind. No one comes over without wanting to linger there, opening drawers and cabinets. As one of my friends noted, \u201ceven the notorious Tupperware drawer looks beautiful.\u201d  She\u2019s right. The quality and organizational skills inherent to the brand, make the kitchen practical, solid and gorgeous.  In addition, the Bulthaup design team (Ellen! and Valentina!) work closely with you, your architect and contractor from start to finish, assuring that every centimeter of space is intentionally utilized. If you\u2019re only satisfied with the best, check out Bulthaup. You won\u2019t be disappointed!!! Poor customer service! I ordered an online item and it came with security tags so I brought it in store to have it removed. This male sales associate working night shift was not helpful in trying to resolve the issue, didn\u2019t even look at the security tag and said I need to contact customer service online and have it shipped back to remove. After speaking with customer service they were confused why I was turned away as they could do it in store. I had to come back two times to solve this issue when it could\u2019ve easily been handled the first time and took two seconds. The environment is a bit strange, when you enter no one acknowledges you and the associates are on their phones or in groups and will just stare at you without speaking. They are rather unfriendly and it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable. I\u2019ve been a few times and it\u2019s always the same thing. Solid 3 for quality of design and I will say the store is always organized and spotless. Poor customer service at the Newbury street outlet in Boston. One sales associate  helped me find my size.  But \u2026On most occasions the associates are not bothered and continue chatting amongst themselves. I go there because of the high quality clothing. Third time I\u2019ve been in the Newbury street store and I won\u2019t go again. I buy online all the time. Love my purchases. However the staff are the store each time is a total deterrent. No customer service, attitude and no reason to. Hopefully not a reflection on the brand, but I would at a minimum do a store visit from corporate and retrain. But I won\u2019t be back in person. I recently visited this store and encountered difficulty returning an online order. Despite my request for assistance, the lady repeatedly insisted that I should handle the return shipment to UPS myself, citing system issues. This contrasts with my other seamless return experience before with other employees, where similar circumstances were handled without a hitch. Furthermore, it appears that this employee may have treated my other Asian friends in a similar dismissive manner, raising concerns of racial bias. We were pleased with my son\u2019s first pair of glasses until 1) the frames broke on the playground weeks later and the cost to replace just the frames was essentially the same as new glasses and 2) after a couple months he started to complain that his glasses weren\u2019t working anymore. We took him back to the eye doctor and discovered that in manufacturing, WP had REVERSED HIS PRESCRIPTION. In children, this can worsen their eyesight in addition to causing eye strain, headaches, and dizziness. Their customer service team is neither apologetic nor handling this major mistake on their part with any urgency. Great experience with staff, assistant and Dr Kim for my first eye exam. Dr Kim took the time to explain my eye health and vision,  answering all my questions.  Ki helped me pick out my first pair of glasses.  I  recommend this WP location to anyone. I would take a picture,  yet new glasses are being made Excellent customer service. Staff were very helpful with my first prescription glasses experience. Efficient eye exam and optometrist was very thorough and explained things very clearly. Highly recommended!! I had a great experience here for my eye exam and purchasing my new glasses and contacts. The doctor and her assistant were very friendly and helpful and provided clarity on all my questions. The exam was quick and she explained the changes in my vision to me. I was helped by Bobby when I was picking out my glasses and they were very nice and helpful with picking out my glasses. I really don\u2019t enjoy going to new doctors but the process here was a breeze and I will be coming back for an annual exam Felix in the Newbury Street store is wonderful. He took care of my glasses for me and demonstrated thoughtfulness, professionalism and kindness. He was excellent. I had a wonderful experience at Flair! This was my first time trying on dresses and I found a beautiful dress in my budget. Grace made the whole experience comfortable and fun. She knows exactly what she\u2019s doing and was very encouraging. She pulled a bunch of dresses and made sure I tried on different styles so I could be sure I wasn\u2019t missing out on anything. Grace added tulle sleeves to a strapless dress without me even having to ask and turned it into the perfect dress. I\u2019m so glad I went to Flair and can\u2019t thank Grace enough for her help! I had been searching everywhere for one specific dress from Australia and found it at Flair. I walked in knowing exactly what I wanted but wanted to try on a few others to make sure. When I walked in I was greeted by  my stylist Katie who instantly made me feel like she had been my best friend for years. Before we did anything we talked about the dress and she made sure it was in my budget. She pulled my dream dress and a bunch of other styles for me to try. The second I put on my dress we knew it was it before I even walked out. After the first dress we tried on two other rounds of dresses that were all stunning. I never felt rushed or pressured to buy. When I went back to my dream dress they didn\u2019t have an additional option that came with it so they pulled something similar so I could see how it looked. I was so happy with the experience and so happy I found them. I would recommend them to any of my friends getting married. It definitely felt like a personal shopping experience instead of a huge shop with a ton of other people around. I also loved how you could walk through the dresses and actually look at them instead of being forced to just sit and wait for them to pull things for you. I just went back to see Katie again to pick up and try on my dress. Again a great experience. If you are looking for a great shopping experience with and amazing stylist go to flair and see Katie. I'm so happy I got my wedding dress at Flair! Kaitie was amazing throughout the entire process. I had picked out a few styles I thought I liked, but it wasn\u2019t until Kaitie pulled a dress I hadn\u2019t even considered and encouraged me to try it on that I found THE dress\u2014my wedding dress. From the moment I put it on, I absolutely fell in love with it. It was everything I didn\u2019t even know I was looking for and I couldn\u2019t have been happier in it on my wedding day. Kaitie truly has an eye for what works and made the experience so easy and enjoyable. I\u2019m so grateful for her expertise and guidance. If you\u2019re looking for your dream dress, I highly recommend Flair! I had a wonderful experience at Flair. The day of my appointment last year, Grace was welcoming and even let us stay a little later than our appointment time so I could get all dressed up before saying yes to my dress!\n\nWhen my wedding dress seamstress stained my wedding dress a few days before my wedding, I was devastated. However, the team at Flair (especially Liz and Stacy) went above and beyond to help with thoughtful ideas on how to fix it. They were supportive and kind throughout the entire process, offering solutions and reassuring me it would all work out (which it did)! After the wedding, they also helped me with setting up my dress to be cleaned and preserved, making sure everything was perfect. I am so grateful for their expertise and care I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience. Highly recommend! I had the best experience dress shopping at Flair! You truly can\u2019t beat the atmosphere, a gorgeous store, right in the middle of the charming brownstones on Newbury Street. Flair has BEAUTIFUL selection of gowns, however the best part of my experience was getting to work with Kaitie. She was such a personable, warm, but strategic stylist. She has been in the industry for years and you can tell. Kaitie KNOWS her stuff. She picked the perfect selection of dresses for me and made me feel so supported and heard during my appointment. I said yes to the first dress I tried on and I owe that all to Kaitie. A stylist truly makes or breaks the experience for you; ASK FOR KAITIE and you will walk out of Flair floating with happiness! I brought my 8 (!) bridesmaids plus my mother to Brideside at the end of December to look at dresses. We were greeted with a bright, cheery and clean studio. I was really impressed by how welcoming it was. The employees offered us champagne upon our arrival and made sure we were all comfortable and had a place to sit. I came in thinking I wanted one specific dress and color, Katherine was able to pull the dress for all of my bridesmaids to try, and gave me suggetions on others to try since I didn't love the first option. We were not the only people in the studio at the time, but they really made me feel like it was exclusively ours. I am so glad we went there and found the dresses my maids will wear when I get married! Thank you for the great experience, Brideside!! I couldn't be happier that I chose Brideside for the bridesmaid dresses for my wedding! Emily was our stylist and she was extremely friendly, professional and easy to communicate with. I had 2 appointments - one to scope out dresses with one of my bridesmaids and decide on a color, then another to decide on styles with a few more ladies - and I had such a great experience for both. My bridesmaids are scattered around the country and Emily was so great with coordinating details for all of them, including sending out try-at-home boxes when needed. I love all the styles they chose and am so excited to see them in person in a few months! I could not be happier with my Brideside experience and I will be recommending them to all of my friends getting married in the future!\n\nI visited the Boston store in February with some of my bridesmaids who live in the area. The store was clean, beautiful, and spacious. We had Katherine as our stylist. She was so kind/helpful and gave the girls great style advice based on their body type and personal style. We were all offered complimentary champagne and my bridesmaids raved about how easy/relaxed this process was compared to dress shopping experiences in the past! The Brideside line has so many styles/colors and is more affordable than most designers I looked at with the same (if not higher) quality!\n\nAdditionally, the customer service consultants I dealt with online (Dominique & Rebecca) were also extremely helpful/responsive and communicated with my out-of-town bridesmaids to coordinate at home try-on boxes! Before the final order was placed they sent me a detailed summary of everyone's styles and colors to make sure they had my approval. I could not have asked for a more organized/laid-back experience. Bri and Emily at Boston\u2019s Brideside Bridesmaid were so helpful in nailing down the color palette, searching for dresses that fit the bridesmaids\u2019 individual styles, and balancing the many different personalities at once. They were kind, honest, and such a pleasure to work with. The showroom is gorgeous, well organized, and offers a wide variety of designers with inclusive sizing (the complimentary champagne was also a nice touch). So happy with our experience at Brideside! Highly recommend. I cannot say enough about how wonderful my experiences were here. The staff was incredibly kind, helpful and accommodating. The first time I went in was on a whim on a Sunday. They didn\u2019t have any standing appointments and let my friend and I try on as many gowns as we wanted. I was helped by the stylist Francesca the first time, who was so helpful and patient. I found my favorite dress during that time, and knew I would come back to try it on again.\nI then came back one week later on a Saturday and was helped by the stylist Caitlin. She greeted my parents, sister and I so warmly and enthusiastically when we arrived for our appointment. She was so incredibly patient, thoughtful and heartfelt in the dresses she picked for me and helped me try on. She gave me so much encouragement to trust my gut and come back to the dress I originally picked. I felt so empowered and beautiful throughout the entire visit.\nWe went way over our allotted appointment time, but the staff was so kind to let us finish. I never felt pressured or rushed.\nI finally found my dream dress, surrounded by my immediate family and the wonderful staff of Brideside.\n\nI highly recommend this bridal salon. The  dresses are incredibly affordable - their most expensive dress is no more than $2500/$3000. It is beautifully decorated and so inviting. I can\u2019t wait to come back and pick up my dress in June. Five out of five stars! I\u2019ve been a long time fan of this clothing brand until my recent experience visiting this store on Newbury St. In August I ordered some gift for a friend who\u2019s leaving Boston. The delivery was 17 days late and missed the friend\u2019s flight. I called the online service number and complained about the delay. A week later they sent me a $100 gift card. So I used that to purchase a couple of full priced items. After receiving the package, I discovered that one of them is smaller than what I need and would like for an exchange of the item. I originally called another Vince store and was told to just go there. Last week, when I went to Newbury St, I found this Vince store and thought that I could just do the exchange there. However, to my surprise, the guy who worked there rejected my request for exchange, saying that because of the gift card they could only refund me the difference between the amount and the $100 and therefore there was no way he could do an exchange. He then repeated several times that because I \u201cused a gift card, there will be no exchange or return,\u201d in a condescending tone. He also claimed that he is the manager who worked there for many years. I was not a big fan of his attitude. It was never made clear to me that things purchased with gift cards would not be exchanged. This is ridiculous that a full priced item could not be exchanged. He also insisted that the other store was giving me wrong information. Interestingly, when I went to the other store the next day,  they helped me with the exchange without any problem or issues raised. Please, the Newbury location does not mean that a double standard and a condescending attitude are justified. Vince, you need to educate your staff some professional communication skills. This person at the store was extremely rude, unpleasant and  was literally looking down upon us. He was like don\u2019t touch anything. But he himself wasn\u2019t maintaining the 6 feet distance. How would I check the hefty price tags and look through the designs before considering to buy? kind and attentive staff. Lovely experience! Absolutely relaxing and amazing experience! This was my first full body massage and they made me feel very comfortable. Great pricing too. I will be going back! What a fantastic experience, in the hands of the beautiful Eva. She communicated with me in fluent English and the communication was very smooth~Some of her massage techniques were new to me, but all were very professionally performed. Her cheerful, smiling, and generally agreeable attitude also helped me feel great and refreshed. Where do I begin?\n\nMy boyfriend and I had a couples massage here over the weekend. Upon arrival we were told to go in the room and get undressed. I needed to use the bathroom which was basically a storage closet with a broken sink, definitely not the quality someone is used to seeing on Newbury Street. We went to the room and were confused as to why there was the paper you\u2019d find at a doctor\u2019s office covering the massage beds - the only reason those are used is so the sheets underneath would not need to be changed in-between appointments - that should have been enough to turn around and leave but we had a sitter at home so we decided to stay.\n\nThe massages started with no conversation about pain or where one might need more attention or focus. Then the phones started. Non-stop texting the entire time we were there. We booked a massage to relax and get away from our phones and responsibilities, not listen to the dinging of someone else\u2019s phones for over an hour.\n\nMy masseuse was chewing gum loudly the entire time and continuing a conversation with my partner\u2019s masseuse so there was no quiet space to relax and unwind. The unprofessionalism was so blatant and unapologetic.\n\nWe paid for a 60 minute massage with an additional 30 minute foot rub - they only massaged for 75 minutes and my masseuse did not massage my feet at any point, she only did my legs. My partner\u2019s masseuse had climbed on his table and was rubbing herself against his hand. I don\u2019t even know what to say about that. Just\u2026no.\n\nThe experience was awful. The employees clearly did not want to be there and customer satisfaction was of zero concern.  I don\u2019t know how they stay in business being surrounded by the top notch service of other businesses in the area but I highly suggest you avoid going here for any reason. Great staff and the place is awesome. The ambient is great, I highly recommend it! First you should know: The company is in legal battle and financial bankruptcy. There is a Facebook group called Interior Define Sucks. Third, they have bad reviews everywhere. STAY AWAY\n\nI personally had a terrible experience with this company and store. The staff at the Boston location were horrible. Always ignore emails to start. At the time of purchase, they did not make it clear to me there is a difference between the ottoman and sofa. 3+ months later (that's how long it takes for them to deliver) we got the two items with ottoman being at least an inch shorter. After many back and forth with the support team, they just pushed me back to the store. Kayla and Stephanie both continuously ignore emails and when I confronted them in the store, they made no attempts trying to solve the issue. They said only options are full return with a fee or pay 25% for exchange and they still can't guarantee the sofa and ottoman will have the same height. I never want to do business with them again. My husband and I had a wonderful experience at this store. Kayla was beyond helpful and really took the time to understand what we needed and were looking for. She was extremely knowledgeable on all the products and was very helpful quoting out the many options we were considering. The store is clean, welcoming, and has a nice layout allowing you to try many options. Would recommend coming to this store and working with Kayla. Stephanie Barbagallo at ID Newbury St. has helped my husband and I purchase many staple pieces for our new home. The customization process was seamless thanks to her. From start to finish, she was with us collaborating, researching, designing, and checking in even after the furniture arrived. We trust her completely and we look forward to our next ID purchase with Stephanie by our side!\n\nWe now own a large sectional with an ottoman, a love seat, a smaller couch and sideboard from ID, and all 4 pieces are absolutely stunning. We receive compliments every time our friends come over. All of the cushion covers are removable, making washing and drying simple and easy. They always look brand new after! We highly recommend considering ID when making your next home furniture or decor purchase, and ask for Stephanie B or any of the friendly and knowledgable staff members at their Boston Newbury St. location. I had been looking at the Maxwell sofa online for a month or two and was delighted to see that Interior Define had a studio in Boston. My appointment with Heaven was excellent! She was so helpful in pulling swatches, providing size advice, and ordering our sofa. She made the process incredibly easy and it was very nice to be able to feel the fabrics and sit on the sofas, which made me feel very confident with my purchase. Excited for my new sofa to arrive!\n\n*Post-delivery update:*\nThe sofa arrived about 8 weeks after ordering (8/3\u201310/4) and the white glove delivery was smooth. The sofa is so comfortable and I\u2019m so glad that we ordered the ottoman to go with it as sort of a pseudo sectional. The color is fantastic and we\u2019re so happy with the size. Would definitely recommend stopping into the showroom and chatting with one of the lovely design experts! Just received my gorgeous dining room chairs with the help of Stephanie in the Boston store. The delivery was seamless and speedy and the chairs are very well-made and absolutely perfect. I will not hesitate to order other furniture from this company. Thank you very much. Helpful and lovely staff- clothes are also beautiful. Wife thought that the selection was thin Saw a protest happening outside of Max Mara as I was walking by today. It turns out they sell animal fur still!! It's unreal, I thought most brands have made the ethical choice already to remove animal fur from their product line, but I guess Max Mara is behind the times. Shame on them How awful they sell fur in 2024.\nAnimals are tortured for their inelegant products.   MAX MARA has blood on their hands. I was unlucky enough to have bought a Madame coat in Italy only to find it had quality issue when I returned to Boston. Communication with Max Mara customer service was a nightmare and they simply disappeared after saying they would \u201ccontact relevant departments\u201d for the exchange request.\n\nThe Boston store, however, was more than helpful and kind. They helped send my coat to a local tailor and tried their best to fix without extra charge. Matthew, the store manager, was the best manager I have met so far. No doubt that he will thrive in the luxury industry. I cannot explain how divine my experience was here. Everyone I interacted with was kind and generous. But Natalie? A customer service superhero. Not only did she immediately find a solution and deliver on getting me the exact pants I needed *overnight,* but I also felt like I made a friend along the way :') DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THEIR \"NICENESS\". The workers are nothing but FAKE. I had the absolute worst experience. Recently I purchased a beautiful handbag from this store. I was so excited to walk out with this product, unfortunately they did not have one in stock, only the displays were available. The quality of the displays were fine, but seemed dirty and very wrinkle since of course they were on display & open for everyone to grab & play around with it. Nonetheless they had insured me that I could order a BRAND NEW one from the store and that it would be delivered the next two days FULLY WRAPPED. I get to the store within the next two days and the bag was not only not wrapped,  but it looked very dirty & wrinkly as the bags on display would look. Imagine my frustration of walking into the store with pure excitement, only to be shattered by the workers trying to trick me. They had not ordered a new bag, but had given me the bag on display and tried to pass it off as the brand new bag I had ordered. Even the protective cover (that is used to cover the bag when leaving the store so the bag won't get dirty) was very dirty and wrinkly. I was very sad and very hurt that they did this to me. Max Mara as a very high end brand should not only be ashamed of themselves but only also at their workers on Newbury St, they do not care about \"their customers\" at all they only care about making a sale. Sophia is amazing to work with! She is incredibly friendly, patient, and takes the time to truly understand your needs. Her knowledge about jewelry is impressive, and she offers thoughtful recommendations without ever being pushy.\n\nShopping with her was such a pleasant experience\u2014she made sure I felt confident and happy with my choices. If you\u2019re looking for someone who genuinely cares and goes above and beyond, Sophia is the one to trust. Highly recommend her to anyone in search of beautiful jewelry and excellent service! Great service from Tarcisio today when I was looking for a bracelet to complete a set for my wife. The store has posted that visits are by appointment, but after scanning the QR code to see if I could get a same day, security let me in. Tarcisio was very friendly and knowledgeable, confirmed the item I was looking for needed to be special ordered, and handle the entire transaction quickly. Given I\u2019m from out of town and we don\u2019t have a local VCA boutique, he even offered to be my point of contact for future sales by phone. Wonderful experience. I\u2019ve had my fair share of pushy advisors who don\u2019t consider my personal wants/ needs. There\u2019s increasing stigma around VCA\u2019s customer service, so I walked in with very low expectations. I am very pleasantly surprised that this was not the case at all with this boutique. Sophia Zhao is the friendliest and most patient advisor I\u2019ve ever met and I\u2019m excited to return to make future purchases with her! She is a polite, experienced, and professional individual. Despite the fact I walked in without an appointment (mistake on my end \ud83d\ude05 I feel bad for adding more to her plate) she handled it very professionally and didn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable. I loved how I got to connect with her and how she patiently listened to my concerns. If you are visiting VCA in Boston please make sure you book your appointment with Tarcisio. He is extremely informative, professional, listens to what you are looking for and ensures you find a piece you truly love. When I purchased my first bracelet there was a small wait time for it to be delivered as it was a high demand piece but, very worth it! I then had it resized and it took a very short amount of time. Communication was excellent throughout the process. I will for sure be purchasing additional pieces and booking my appointment with Tarcisio. Everyone in the store is so pleasant. Highly recommend. Worked with Tarcisio and cannot say enough about how outstanding the service and his attention to detail was during my purchase of a bracelet and necklace for my mother. He is truly a pro and provided excellent service. I will definitely be back! We worked with Will from Firestone & Parson for our engagement and wedding rings and had a wonderful experience! The team went above and beyond to meet our every need, answer every question we had, and provided the best service we could have asked for. Their expertise, professionalism and care are unmatched. You'll be in great hands with these folks! Thanks Will and team!! These guys are such massive jewelry nerds. I love it! Firestone & Parson combines superb taste in gem quality, integrity, and service.\nThe are highly, highly recommended. Never have I encountered such rude condescension. They will never get my patronage. Jewelry in the best of taste I bought a pair of brown oxfords from armani which I thought was top quality . Well it turns out one shoes colour die was not set and bleed after polish . Only one though,  the other one was fine and used the same product .\u2026take a look at the photos and beware when buying their leather shoes . I guess they are actually closed on Sundays. Drove in from another state to learn they are closed. Closed on Sunday. Been there twice already. They really should update the business hours. I go there for the t-shirts... but usually leave with more. Somewhat small selection. Told them what I was looking for and their recommend was way off. We love the Bvlgari Boston location,  all the staff are attentive and friendly.  I love to visit the store.\nTiya and her staff have helped me create a perfect collection of pieces for both day and night, and I couldn't be happier with all my Bulgari purchases. My husband is so happy with his Octo Finissimo Perpetual Calendar watch which is a really spectacular time piece.  Bvlgari pieces are really something else. Beautiful and extraordinary.\nThank you Tiya and all at Bvlgari Boston. Five stars because I absolutely love the Octo Finissimo. Minus two stars because with all due respect, Bulgari needs more in-depth training for sales staff. Because of the enormous success of the Finissimo, Bulgari now has serious watch collectors visiting its stores. The knowledge of the sales staff is not sufficient enough for what enthusiasts expect. I want to see Bulgari get better because I'm invested in the watches and brand.   Thank you. The staff xinxin is one of the most friendly staffs I have ever meet. She is professional, patient, nice and friendly! Really enjoy this visiting. Even though this is a high end store on Newbury Street, they do a great job making everyone that walks through the door feel welcome and appreciated. Since finding this shop, I do not bring my Bvlgari for servicing anywhere else! We had a fantastic shopping experience here. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. Will come again! Fantastic service.\nWe went in with one broken lock, the manager immediately noticed the second one was cracked also. Someone had probably opened the case with a screwdriver\u2026\n\nThey replaced both locks same day.\n5 minute drop off  5 minute collection, super efficient, did not waste our time.\n\nGreat shop & staff, highly recommended.\nIt\u2019s service like this that makes Rimowa worth every penny. I have been a very happy customer of Rimowa for over a decade, having purchased over 11 suitcases to date and used them without much issue. This sustained satisfaction was brought to an end due to the disappointing service standards experienced at this Boston store.\n\nI had brought in my trunk as some of the plastic studs on the bottom and back had came off, exposing the sharp screws that have injured me and others a couple of times and damaged my parquet flooring at home. Though it was not the latest model, the Frankfurt store had recently offered to fix it for free but was unable to do so then as I was enroute to the airport and the suitcase had contained belongings. In addition to having offered free repair, the Frankfurt store also replaced the light grey wheels with black ones to match my other Rimowas, completely free of charge. I also had similar excellent service in other stores around the world - London, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.\n\nWhen I was last at this store a couple of months ago, the staff repaired a dent in my aluminium trunk at no cost, though this other trunk was out of warranty and it involved more work than replacing a couple of plastic studs.\n\nThis time, I brought my suitcase in and had my details taken down. The staff that attended to me then said \u201cyou\u2019re all set\u201d. There was no mention of any charges at any point, so I had naturally assumed it would have been complimentary as I had experienced previously at this store, and in other stores.\n\nA business does not take in a product and say \u201cyou\u2019re all set\u201d without informing the customer of any (potential) charges and then continuing with repair works.\n\nThe store shortly afterwards rang me to inform me of the cost of replacing the inner lining (separate issue which I had enquired about in store). I then asked to be sure if there were any charges for the repair of the plastic studs and they quoted me $150. I asked why was I not informed of this in-store or on the phone call until I asked, to which no satisfactory answer was given. I then requested to discuss the matter with the store manager, who was not around.\n\nA few days later, I finally managed to speak with the assistant store manager, Dengi, and he gave me a long list of excuses as to why they had to charge for such a simple repair. I then explained my experience in other Rimowa stores, but he insisted that the charge remains.\n\nI then informed him not to carry out the repair and that I would collect it later in the day but he said that the repairs had already been done and he will ask his staff to undo them.\n\nImagine paying $2450 for a suitcase and having to deal with the pettiness and stinginess this store has. Repair had already been carried out (though I had said that I would first discuss the matter with the store manager), and they would undertake additional work to undo it because I did not agree with the repair fee.\n\nWhat took the absurdness next level was when I returned to the store to have my trunk picked up. Dengi told me that perhaps they would consider doing the repair without charge if I purchased something from them. Goodness, such low-level sales tactics.\n\nIf you need any after-sales support, don\u2019t bother coming here. Even cheap brands like Tumi, Samsonite or Delsey would provide better after-sales service. A Rimowa purchase is one I've long considered. For years, I immersed myself in far too many articles and videos about the differences between Classic and Original and carry-on vs. check-in. Armed with all the knowledge the internet can convey, I finally visited the Boston store. I worked with Kathe Berkeley who answered all my inane questions with the expertise and patience of a true professional. I'm ecstatic to finally own such a fine piece of luggage. Thanks Kathe, you made the experience a memorable one. This is a great location my sales rep helped me pick out the perfect luggage and was helpful answering all my questions. Absolutely awful experience. Wasted a full day communicating with this clueless store - when they even answer their phones.\n\nI\u2019ve been a Rimowa customer for 10 years with the metal large cube and all other metal classic line trunks (with which I\u2019ve never once complaint on how quickly they scratch and bend and are way too heavy etc - but perhaps now will). Unbelievable that they couldn\u2019t arrange a time sensitive gift for a client for delivery. I called from NYC for a purchase in Boston locally for a reason. After giving me and my assistant the run around all day their store manager, Benji (what he claims to be but I don\u2019t believe that even as he sounds like a kid) - told us that we need to come in in-person unless we have a purchase history. I have a huge history with the brand as confirmed by him directly and the he goes and says that I still need to come in in person - which is not feasible as, again, I\u2019m in NYC and for the exact reason that I need the bag in Boston delivered - I am calling this specific store. Again - all which was confirmed to be possible since the morning and we\u2019ve spent hours selecting the right product and checking availability of such in this boutique.\n\nNot only a loss of a customer and sale - a gigantic taint on the brand as a whole. Super shame and I doubt the Newbury store should be closed as it serve 0 purpose to be locally in Boston to fulfill orders for real global travelers. The most unprofessional experience I\u2019ve ever had at the Burberry store. All the two women at the store were very unpleasant! Nicole the general manager should be fired. A person like this should not work at a luxury clothing store especially at Burberry\n\nThey refused to accept my shoes for exchange because they had a little dust. I only tried them at home and never took them outside. They are just like they were at the store when I bought them. Staff has no idea what they are doing! Came in for a simple return. Had all items and recipes yet they still managed to return the funds on the wrong card! How?! Blamed POS system for it taking over an hour to process transaction, something about \"communications\". Then once I noticed and spoke with them about the funds being returned to the wrong card now I have to wait for Michael the store manager to call me back to resolve the issue that should of never happened in the first place! Keep it simple if going here, know what you want and hope you don't ever have to return or exchange. I have to update my review based on the experience we had post after my original visit. After purchasing a scarf and coat the coat required alterations estimated at two weeks.\n\n1. I never received a call notifying me the alterations where completed, after waiting three weeks I had to call in several times for an update\n\n2. I never received a card or follow up email thanking me for my business\n\n3. I informed Jeremy of this and he had taken the wrong phone number and address. That the thank you cards and phone call notification when to the wrong person.\n\nI do not think we provided the incorrect number / address and Jeremy was all excuses when responding. I thought that he would eventually correct this by sending another card or something to let my wife know her business is appreciated and make her feel special. This is why you shop at a luxury department store like Burberry, but it has been over a month since and no follow up.\n\nOriginal review:\nTop quality service as one expects from a prestigious brand such as Burberry. Give yourself the best experience and ask for Jeremy. A very very respectable British brand founded in 1856 .It sell luxury aperral and accessories . It is famous for it's Cashmere Scarfs ,trench coats iconic checks . There Customer service is great .The sale staff will generally walk  you through the store so that you can pick and choose what do you want .They have 5 floors of clothing,bags and more. I just bought a trench coat from them. However wasn\u2019t really sure about the size as a size smaller wasn\u2019t available in the store (mostly 34 US isn\u2019t available in any design in the store) and the size I bought was a tad bit boxy near the torso and waist. So went in for suggestion and styling advice and to see if I could tailor it to fit my needs. A sales associate took me in, named Jeremy, offered advice and he was fantastic. I commend him for the expertise in the area. I also appreciate that his goal was to ensure that I was satisfied with the product. Not many people do this. He was excellent at offering styling advice and I appreciate this a lot. However, he was getting irritated very easily by my questions. He was helping, but making it look like he was dealing and tolerating a bad customer. At some point he even said \u2018may be trench coat is not your style\u2019 \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Not sure what he meant by that and why was he getting so irritated by me very easily. All I was trying to do was to see if I have options where it fits perfectly in the shoulders and tapered down through the torso and waist so I could swap the current one with something that fits my taste. Apart from that, when I was trying to tell him that the wool cashmere coat fit me well and trying to ask him if I could swap this with that, he misunderstood what I was trying to ask ( by cutting me off in the middle assuming he knew 100% what i was going to ask), and kept on repeatedly telling me that the wool cashmere fit me because of the fabric, like 5 times also showing a bit of peevish behavior while doing so :) of course I understand it\u2019s due to fabric! I would have appreciated if I was given a chance to expound on the question if he wasn\u2019t clear. All I was trying to ask him was if i could swap the current one with wool cashmere one. Not sure he had any issues with me in specific! Shouldn\u2019t have, as I was seeing him help me for the first time. Someone else came in and he was nice to them and he even offered him water too! Lol. Anyway, may be it was a long day for him and a bit tiresome. I mean I didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t being helpful, he did help and throw in right styling advice, which I appreciate to the core, and he also called in the tailor and she advised me the same and hence validated Jeremy\u2019s advice, but I just felt he was getting irritated easily when I was asking questions and was forcing himself to be nice to me. Something that I don\u2019t expect from a brand like Burberry at least. The furniture is amazing, however the  delivery and customer service after delivery was disappointing, especially given the cost of the \"white glove delivery.  We had an admittedly challenging delivery; however we got an eye-roll when we told them we wanted the piece upstairs and the delivery staff left after less than 5 minutes of trying.  We had to move it ourselves.  We don't blame the company for the challenge, but the delivery is way too expensive for eye-rolls and almost no effort to help. thos moser Thos Moser I went in to purchase a pair of sunglasses. A asian gentleman tried to assist me and showed me three pairs of sunglasses that were far more expensive than the pair I was shopping for. I asked if the pair I was looking for was located at any stores near me and he told me it was sold out throughout the entire country. I called a client advisor in customer service who located a pair at the Sacks 5th Chanel. I walked over and purchased the exact pair I was looking for the same day. Walked in with a buddy of mine in casual street clothes, and who I assume is the store manager(the only asian lady on shift) immediately seemed to have judged us. Despite the fact they have about 20 workers posted up around every corner, this wack-job followed right behind us without saying a word during our whole stay at the shop. I honestly have to say I\u2019ve never felt so uncomfortable\u2026Am I not in the right tax bracket for your store? Am I not wearing the right clothes to shop at a Chanel? They should really go ahead and fire this lady. She\u2019s doing them a massive disservice. The worst Chanel experience ever. Asian sales women sigh everytime I asked to show the product. And not assisting customer properly like staring just phone and looking like upset as I am asking different color and different design. I was there just for five minute to see the product and already felt like not welcoming. Saks fifth avenue Chanel doing way better I walked in and told the sales associate what I wanted. She showed me a few options. I didn\u2019t love anything, and kept asking if there were other styles/colors, etc. She wasn\u2019t that helpful and suggested nothing. I walked around the store and found the bag I ended up buying by myself, ha. I have worked in retail, and currently work in marketing. When a customer tells you what they are interested in, give them all the options, slightly bigger, slightly smaller, different colors, I mean suggest something! She could have also showed me shoes, wallets, perfume, could have spent more money. I got nothing! I don\u2019t shop that high end that often, maybe that\u2019s the problem? I won\u2019t go back, should just order offline, or go see my girl Lulu at Gucci who is actually nice and takes the time to show me stuff she thinks I\u2019ll like. The store had a rude atmosphere, so I simply switched to Saks Fifth Avenue Chanel to enjoy my shopping there. Had to cancel my appointment because I was incredibly sick and bed ridden and they charged me over $100 for a late fee \u2026 never had customer service so bad. Will never be going back. I have been a consistent client for  over the past 2 years\nNever missed an appointment and never rescheduled!\nMy appointment was scheduled on the day of my surgery despite I made it explicitly clear that I had a surgery that day and I needed the following day! That was a booking mistake , which I missed! However I was told I will be charged a full price of the reservation regardless.\nI think it is a horrible customer service despite the Colorists   and Stylists team is amazing. One of the hardest parts of relocating is finding a new stylist. I was so fortunate to have Fiona cut and style my hair on 3/18/23. Professionally, she instantly understood what I needed and took my hair to the next level. Personally, she was such a pleasant person to chat with and I look forward to coming back. I\u2019m beyond grateful for her skilled professionalism and positive demeanor. If you are in Boston don\u2019t miss out on booking Fiona at Sassoon Salon on Boylston St as soon as possible. Initially I came in person to book an appointment, to make sure that by seeing my hair the correct service could be scheduled (blending of my grey hair that I have diligently been growing out for a full year)- which went very smoothly as they assured me they blend grey hair all the time (which make sense given the current grey hair trend).\nHowever, when I returned weeks later for my appointment I was told by the colourist that \u201cI WAS A WASTE OF HER TIME\u201d and she refused to help me.\nI was absolutely astonished that this lovely salon (it wasn\u2019t my first time there) would allow someone so cancerous to work there.\nThe rest of the staff was lovely and kind to me, however, unless the colourist (Laurel) had any type of corrective measures taken to never speak to a client like that again (which I did not see happen while I was there), then this bad behaviour is actually being endorsed and accepted by the salon staff and manager~ truly disappointing. I've been a regular since the late 90's (when I accompanied my girlfriend for her cut and styling appointment. I started soon afterward and haven't regretted it a day, since.)\n\nFor the past 10+ years, Amy has been my stylist. I've got tight curls that never seemed to grow out into a style I liked until I started working with a stylist, here. Amy is especially adept at really \"hearing\" me and cutting and styling to accommodate how my hair grows in addition to how it looks when I enter the salon and when I leave the salon.\n\nThe amenities here are fine. As others have mentioned, they varied during the pandemic (and whose didn't!?) I was thrilled they worked (at all) during the pandemic (and they operated safely for both employee and patron.) I don't come here to be waited on hand-and-foot. Their styling and cutting are honed to expert levels (at least in my experience. I tried other salons in Boston and the 'burbs before committing here.) Plus I've found employees to be cheery (even early on weekend mornings, my usual slot) and conversant.\n\nWorking so closely with the public isn't easy or simple. What I/we see on and around our heads isn't always what a professional sees (or recommends.) I believe this is a meeting-of-minds, and when I've deferred to the experts here, I've always benefitted. Worked with Pompanoosuc Boston to order a custom rocking chair for our nursery. We love it so much! It's beautiful and was made and delivered on-time. Highly recommend! Always fun to see what is new and to swoon over items I am saving up to buy. The Rupert sofa is a favorite and allows you to choose from three different cushion comfort levels. The Mission recliner I own is still gorgeous. Also love the flexibility to choose different woods, stains and finishes. We purchased three pieces of bedroom furniture- all pieces were from separate showrooms . The Boston staff , your online assistance , and warehouse staff were professional, helpful and NICE! The two gentlemen who delivered the pieces knew all about your products and the quality of the pieces. The pieces are beautiful. Thank you - we expect to purchase more in the future. Pompanoosuc Mills' furniture is beautiful and premier quality, and I use it exclusively.  I'd also like to give a shout-out to Pompy's delivery team, Mike and Justin - those guys are great!   -Kevin Great showroom.  Many styles and finishes on display.  Very nice design staff available to advise.  Nice follow up after showroom visit as well. If you want to feel disrespected while shopping, please make sure to stop here.\n\nTo provide some context, to enter into the store you need to walk into the building and then through another door into the store itself. The door to enter into the building was not opening (this was within business hours - Saturday at ~4pm). Luckily a customer was walking out after (multiple people) tried opening the outer door.\n\nUpon entering the store, we informed the staff about the door. Their response was arrogant and rude. \"This is an old building\" and more. It was their customer service and response prevented us from shopping there.\n\nI saw a dress online that I was interested in buying but wanted to try on prior to purchasing. However, after the way they treated us, we determined that we'd be shopping elsewhere. I had a great experience with may sister and friends at this store . They were very polite and helped me shop !I will be back for sure . Lovely shop! They don't have a huge selection but the clothes are all gorgeous and employees are really helpful in finding sizes and placing orders. Kyle helped me put together a cute outfit with some sale items and was overall just great to work with. I'll definitely be back again Second trip to Boston and the manager Mike remembered who I was from the last time I stopped in the store. Super sweet and knowledgeable, store was immaculate, always beautiful pieces to choose from. Finally made my first purchase there and I couldn\u2019t be happier. Definitely going back to Boston soon and look forward to running into him again Its my second time this year visiting Boston, and I had so much joy to shop in this shop . I really had such a good experience with both of the sellers: Steffanie  and second one who were do kind, helpful, understanding, and especially were there for me.\nI came this visit twice to the store snd felt wonderful. i always have the most amazing experience at this location (along with charles street). the sense of belonging that the teams foster is so heart warming. i always leave the store feeling satisfied. shout out to max who gets my curly coarse textured hair right every time and kailen for the top notch skincare rec\u2019s! xoxo I went into Credo to find a new skincare routine and Becca helped me find products that are best for my skin type and could help address any skin concerns that I had. She knew a lot about the products & brands and was really friendly! I love how there is a range in price points for these really high quality products so that everyone can find something they like here:) I'm not big on shopping in store, nor am I a clean beauty devotee, but I will be making a point to patronize this location. Not only do they have makeup brands that are hard to track down in person but the staff is absolutely fantastic. Echoing numerous other reviews, Ron is the best. I stopped by during their black Friday sale, despite the store being quite busy and initially planning on just trying to figure out what to get on my own, he saw me struggling to decide and offered to help. He then spent over 20 minutes (and past the end of his shift as I found out later) making recommendations, helping me swatch different products, and letting me know if he thought they would work for me. While my interactions with everyone else was limited they all seemed very sweet as well. The store was also spotless. Will definitely be back. Visited Credo for the first time today, solely because I had a gift card to use but now I know I\u2019ll be back all the time because the experience was so great! Ron helped me and he was extremely knowledgeable, kind, and helpful. The vibe of the store is wonderful and welcoming. They have every product or item you could want. My new go to spot on Newbury for skincare and cosmetics - great product selection and excellent customer service - everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable.   Ron offer his sage advice on helping me pick out the PERFECT shade of red lipstick.  Thank you! Ladies please take your business elsewhere on Newbury st, for a better service. Don\u2019t spend your hard earned money on this store that sells cheap material clothing that are thin and not even a designer. This store customer service is disappointing and yet with an ignorant manager. You shop at Cartier they will be treating you like their sisters and brothers. This place does not worth of your any penny. Went by today and had an amazing experience. Coming from Chicago where the service is not so well.  I was pleasantly surprised with the professionalism, attentiveness and care from the salesperson. Had a lovely experience. Thank you to the salesperson Carlos D for his assistance. Will definitely be coming back to this location. Went here last week to buy something for myself and my wife. The customer service from Olivi\u00e9 (hope I spelled that right) was unmatched. He listened to what I needed, gave me several options, and ultimately we found the perfect gift. I\u2019m a big fan of Aesop so I knew what to expect from the product but the customer service at this location makes me want to go back in person instead of ordering online. If you\u2019re unsure of what to get or would like to sample something, I highly recommend going here and asking for Olivi\u00e9. Shopping with Kristol was such a relaxing experience and truly captured the brands vibe. What stood out was the excellent product knowledge and empathy for the clients concerns. Would recommend you to visit the shop and experience the cool brand and staff. I\u2019ve always been a fan of Aesop and regularly purchase their products, but my experience at the Newbury store yesterday was disappointing due to the staff\u2019s unwelcoming attitude. The store didn\u2019t open on time at 11 a.m., and the staff member on duty Jessica was cold and unhelpful throughout my visit. After buying two products, I wasn\u2019t offered any samples, and when I requested some, Jessica reluctantly provided only three. She even charged us for THREE \u201cBag Charge Boston Paper Bag\u201d, which is crazy. I only requested one small paper pouch. Aesop is known for its exceptional customer service, which is why I\u2019ve been a loyal customer, but this experience was far from what I\u2019ve come to expect. I hope Aesop can train their staff better. Great perfumes and good customer service. Divinity spent adequate time with us ensuring we got the perfume that we love Products here are very good. I\u2019ve been using many product lines for couple years now. Yesterday went  to buy body lotion. The pump didn\u2019t work and had to bring back for replacement, disappointed and wasting time. This should not happen with high-end brand whatsoever!!! My all-time favorite store for apparel and accessories!!! I am an avid collector of \"art to wear\" at Peruvian Connection. The rich color palette, exotic designs inspired by far away times and places, comfy fabrics, and top notch customer service have been unrivaled in my experience for well over a decade. Beautiful, wearable art clothing. I am giving a low rating to this location because every time I go in it is impossible to get assistance from the staff. They are glued to their phones, decline to greet, make eye contact with, or wait on customers. It seems they think they are cashiers at a grocery store. And I am the store's demographic! For those prices, with zero service, I will either wait on myself online, or go to TJ Maxx for superior customer care. And I will contact the store manager with this feedback. The bohemian style women's clothing in Peru, South America, is very beautiful. Several female companions were ecstatically shopping. I rarely leave reviews but my experience here was so lovely, I just had to leave one!\n\nI am visiting from out of town and don\u2019t have a local needlepoint store near me, so I wanted to check Stitch Boutique out, and I am so glad I did! The moment I walked in, Kelsey welcomed me and offered to help if I needed anything. After browsing some canvases, I picked one out (see photo) and Kelsey helped me pick the perfect combination of thread colors and textures for this canvas. She even put it on stretcher bars for me, what service! She was extremely kind and personable towards myself and the other number of customers who came in after me.\n\nI will certainly be back next time I am in town! I highly recommend this store for any local needlepoint needs. They have an excellent selection of canvases, including New England themed ones and an essentially infinite selection of threads to choose from. Great selection of canvases, fibers, accessories (e.g. stretcher bars), and finishing services. I'm impressed by how well stocked this sweet little store is for the small size. There is also a second location in Winchester and they're able to easily send things between stores (or order) if Boston doesn't have what you need. Stitch Boutique helped me with my first ever canvas in Feb 2021 and have been so helpful along the way. An excellent local needlepoint store! Just recently took a beginners lesson with Susan. She was incredibly helpful, patient, and kind with teaching me how to begin and answered all of my questions I had. I can\u2019t wait to finish my first project and return to Stitch Boutique for more projects and guidance :) Amazing to have this great needlepoint shop downtown! They have everything you would need in terms of threads, needles, beads, stretcher bars, books, project bags, and a great selection of canvases. I've also had both custom canvas painting and finishing done and the work is excellent and had fast turn around. On top of that the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. Small shop but well worth the visit, per my wife as she purchased several kits. Location close to swan boat rides in Boston. Other locations further from the city. Super friendly staff and amazing product! Great price point too! Original stuff! I\u2019ve done research on months to find the perfect couch. We wanted something that would hold up to our 2 dogs, 2 cats and a toddler. We could not be more obsessed. Not only is the couch extremely beautiful and comfortable, simple spills/mud just wipe away with a wet cloth and all the pieces and I mean ALL are washable. My husband and I often discuss how happy we are with our purchase and look forward to coming home after work to lounge. I personally worked with David through 7th ave Boston and he made the process so easy! He was there to answer all my questions and wasn\u2019t at all pushy about the purchase. They offer virtual tours if you\u2019re purchasing online like I did. You can tell this company actually cares about their clientele. We purchased the sand beige in velvet and it\u2019s perfect for our space! It literally came in 10 days, unlike other companies where you have to wait months.  Absolutely worth the money and will probably never go without a 7th avenue couch! My new couch is a dream!  Perfect color so comfortable exactly what I hoped for. David from the Newbury Street store in Boston made the entire experience amazing. I was tenuous about buying a couch through a virtual consultation but he masterfully and patiently worked with me to figure out the right configuration for my space. He was responsive to all my questions immediately. I recommend anyone interested in 7th Ave to call David. Thank you David! David was an incredible help assisting me in picking out my configuration and color. The couch has just arrived and I am absolutely obsessed! Assembly was simple due to the clear and concise instruction video. Customer service has also gone above and beyond through this entire process. Even with a shipping delay the team called me to explain and apologize. Will be continuing to shop here as I move. Could not recommend enough. We visited the showroom on 2/10 and met Jaqueline. She was wonderful, answered all our questions and wasn't pushy at all about making a sale. She even poured soda all over the couch to demonstrate the repellant fabric. We did end up ordering the couch and it came just over a week later. We just set it all up and it looks great (it'll look even better once I steam those covers!) We just placed our couch order so this is less of a review of the product & more of a review of the service we\u2019ve received thus far from David M. out of the Boston office/showroom. I will report back with a review on the couch once we receive it.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure how the assignment works as we are based in Southern CA, but when I requested swatches, David contacted us to offer his consulting services. He\u2019s been friendly, helpful with our questions, & extremely responsive.\n\nWe are very excited to receive our couch. Thanks for your help David! After visiting other lighting showrooms around greater Boston, this one is THE BEST. Greatest selection of many styles and manufactures. But what really set them apart was our salesperson, Kimberly. She jumped up to help, was super knowledgeable about the showroom, eager to answer our questions and even thoughtfully asked about ceiling heights and wire length. Other shops with big names or big \u201cbest of awards\u201d were NOT worth the trip and basically ignored or insulted us upon our visits. Neena\u2019s and Kimberly made this a pleasurable experience and a joy to do business with. Thank you. Our condominium in Cambridge has been looking for new fixtures.  It has been a challenging process.  Giovanna has been positively amazing throughout.  She always suggests a variety of options within our parameters, and remains ever patient to changing preferences.  I couldn't ask for more! My designer and I have worked with Giovanna on lighting for a number of years and projects, most recently for an extensive renovation of a new home and attached barn.  Giovanna has been incredible every step of the way, both in terms of suggesting options and getting back quickly with responses to questions for the Manufacturer.  She's made the whole lighting process as easy as possible.  And for the few times she was not available, Kimberly filled in and was terrific as well.  The breadth of companies Neenas represents will allow for every style and finish possible.  Would highly recommend Neena's and the folks in the Boston/Newbury St location. Went in today to look for some entryway lighting and had the pleasure of meeting Jose. His enthusiasm for art and lighting design was infectious. He is not only an amazing ambassador for Nina's, he made the whole experience awesome. Everyone here is super helpful and nice - we had to go in a few times to get what we need, and I felt everybody there went well out of there way to support us. Very cool products too! I was very impressed with this store and its employees.  They were all very knowledgeable and were more than willing to help me with the look of my and my best man\u2019s wedding suits.  I had built the suits I thought I wanted online and after some questions from my now wife as to how some of the colors might look together, I became skeptical. I was helped by Elijah, and he could not have been more helpful.  Again, he had me try on several jackets and went over colors with me and persuaded me to change my colors.  He was totally right.  He suggested a white shirt with an ivory vest and tie.  He showed me all the materials and how it might look together and I agreed that it would look good.  He was right, the combination was great and looked incredibly tasteful.  Fantastic job! Great customer service. I am rather surprised by the amount of negative reviews as my experience was pretty much the opposite. I went there to buy a wedding suit and Calvin was amazing helping me during the whole process. Even though we had some last minute alterations to do, they managed to get that for me the same day. I would definitely recommend it! Terry guessed my jacket size at a glance and fitted me perfectly within minutes. Extremely professional. What usually can be overwhelming he made incredibly painless and simple. He recommended some well fitting and nice options all within my budget. Incredibly nice staff. Ask for Terrence he knows what he\u2019s doing. Needed a suit for an upcoming wedding and I dreaded this process since I am a difficult fit being overweight! I went to the Saugus store and Mike took my measurements, removed a suit off the rack, perfect color and fabric, and it fit me perfectly!  Also, he recommended a beautiful looking pair of shoes which matched the suit but I told him I am very difficult fit for shoes...wide foot and gout....and again the first pair I tried on fit better than any shoe I have. All this took less than 30 minutes...and with several big discount coupons.....I am one satisfied and happy customer! EXTREMELY RUDE AND IMPATIENT STAFF.\nEverybody were warm and welcoming the first time when I went to buy a suit. Had a problem with the fit and went again to get it fixed and was embarrassed by one sales rep who was rude and said he \"doesn't care\" for everything. Had to go again for alterations and had another sales rep show his attitude. When I asked him why everybody were rude all the time, he simply gave me a refund for the alterations and asked me to leave the store and said he did not wish to offer any services to me. (I simply rejected the refund and left the store). I was never humiliated like this before. Very unprofessional attitude and lousy customer service. I hate Men's Wearhouse now! Lugged all the clothing I needed altered over here on a Saturday afternoon. Sign and website say the place is open until 5:30 on Saturdays. Got here at 4:06. Gate is locked, store is dark. Thanks for nothing. My husband was on a business trip in Boston with a nice suit which didn't fit anymore and quickly needed a replacement. The very experienced and friendly Carmine not only found a perfect fit but he also adjusted the older suit overnight. Nice craftsmanship and very reasonable prices. Highly recommended! I struggled for years to find dress shirts that fit me properly off the rack. I tried several of the online \"made to measure\" brands out there with very unsatisfactory results. I decided to give Sordillo's custom-made shirts a try. Carmine took my measurements, showed me fabric options, recommended the right collar and other trim options, and promised a perfectly fit shirt. He delivered! He nailed the fit on the first try, and the fabric and workmanship are simply beautiful. Carmine is an old-world craftsman who knows what he is doing. He clearly loves his work and cares about his customers' satisfaction. If you don't appreciate the concept of \"su misura,\" then Sordillos might not be for you, but if you want the look that only bespoke tailoring can deliver, at a fair and reasonable price, then I would definitely recommend Sordillos. Absolutely amazing work! The owner Carmine has been in back bay doing business for over 20 years and it shows. His attention to detail, professionalism, and finished custom work are second to none. Prices are great as well. So long as I\u2019m in Boston I won\u2019t think twice about who to visit. It will be Sardilllo\u2019s every time. Carmen took my large cashmere two button pull over and trimmed it down for me; he did a beautiful job. He was referred to me by the people at Loro Piana The employees are kind and attentive!! It made my shopping enjoyable I love this store...great selection, excellent professional staff!  A true retail experience!  I wish I lived in the city but alas I'm a suburbanite.\nSo I can only get in occasionally.  It's a treat when I can!  Keep up the good work ladies! Horrible store design. All items mixed  together regardless of type of size - misses, petites and plus. The cash registers are ridiculously arranged within the store, they have a table and not a stand, hard to reach the credit card machine if you are a short person. Beautiful store.  Friendly workers. I'm thankful this has opened in Copley Place. I have experienced the same nightmare with USTrust investment advisors and now with the Client Service Assurance department. I have brought to their attention specific examples of negligence , specifically not following trust instructions.  I have done extensive research and review of the accounts and I am certain USTRUST Private Wealth Management has taking advantage of my 93 year Old mother for over 17 years. At this point they are withholding important records and have promised to reconcile the accounts, however, they will not return phone calls or emails from myself or my mother. This has been going on for several months(going on 6 months since I have repeatedly requested information on behalf of my mother) they refuse to return my calls despite the fact they have had full authority from my mother, in writing, to speak with me. USTRUST CANNOT BE TRUSTED! These people are horrible. No, wait, worse than horrible. They have hundreds of thousands of dollars of mine and won't give it to me. It's been six months. Totally unbelievable! I'd rather shoot myself than do business with these people again! US \"Trust\" my butt. My experience at Back Bay was overall pleasant. It\u2019s worth noting that this is a busy location, even on a Monday, which speaks to their popularity. Despite having an appointment, I did have a brief wait of about 15 minutes, but once I met my stylist, Jamelia, everything went smoothly from there. Jamelia was professional, attentive, and truly made me feel comfortable throughout the appointment. She not only listened to my preferences but also offered her expertise, which resulted in a hairstyle I\u2019m extremely happy with. The attention to detail she showed made it clear that she takes pride in her work, and her warm and friendly demeanor made the whole experience enjoyable. I am beyond pleased with both the results and the quality of service I received from Jamelia! I highly recommend her if you\u2019re looking for someone who can deliver beautiful results with a great customer experience. The Good, the Bad & the Ugly\nGOOD: There are great stylists. I'd love to be able to book directly w/ my preferred instead of dealing w/ the front desk. Really good price!\nBAD: It's impossible to reach by phone. 95% of the time it goes to VM. I've never received a call back when I left a message. Phones are often broken, so I'm told. Even if you're trying to cancel it's impossible to reach anyone. No way to cancel online even.\nUgly - the number of times I've waited ages is bonkers. 5, 20 even 15 minutes I can understand. 30 - 45 minutes & only a \"sorry\". Management should try to offer something for your time. An upgrade would be nice.\nThere is new ownership which sounds like they treat people better. But no one is truly minding the shop. I was really excited for my appointment at Dry Bar Back Bay, especially after having an amazing experience at one of their NYC locations. Unfortunately, this visit didn\u2019t quite live up to my expectations. I was in Boston celebrating my birthday, and while the stylist did a good job on my hair, the experience felt impersonal. She wasn\u2019t very hospitable or welcoming, and didn\u2019t even greet me with a simple \u201chi, how are you?\u201d The lack of warmth and customer service took away from what I was hoping would be a fun and celebratory appointment. It\u2019s a shame, because the hair itself turned out well, but the overall experience was disappointing. I went here when in Boston for a wedding. Unfortunately my appointment time had to be changed to accommodate a sick call but they were flexible and fit me in. The blow-out turned out great! I could\u2019ve done my own hair better. Edges were frizzy when I walked out. Way too loud in there and staff discussing things that clients don\u2019t need to hear Similar experience to someone else in the reviews, except I thankfully called ahead. I wanted to ask what the prices and turnaround times are like. Whoever answered the phone got aggressive and started berating me, repeating himself over and over saying he can't tell me prices unless I bring the clothes in. When I finally got a word in I said, \"Okay, I didn't know. I've never visited a tailor before\" -- he hung up on me.\n\nStrange experience, and I feel thankful I'm not leaving my designer suits with this unhinged person. Dependable Cleaners was much more normal about tailoring questions on the phone and I'm going with them instead, they do a great job with dry cleaning so I already trust them. Celio was absolutely wonderful. He did a perfect and very careful tailoring of my wedding suit pants. He genuinely went above and beyond. Very personable as well. They saved me on a dress I needed hemmed for a wedding! Appreciated the fast and kind service. When the zipper on a relatively new quarter-zip fell off, I asked the retail store if they would repair or replace it. They said no and suggested I seek a tailor. Back Bay Tailor attended me right away, repaired the zipper, and sewed it securely so it wouldn't fall off again. He would not accept payment. It felt like a neighborhood business interested in establishing long-term relationships with satisfied customers. Very nice, patient and professional place, today they fixed a button on a corduroy skirt for me, made sure to match the linen in the back of the button  to the rust brown color of the skirt. Very quick, I waited only 5 min and it was complete. Place was clean and organized. Staff were friendly. BUT big plus to curvy ladies, If you struggle with clothing that fit your hips but too big on your waist, this place is your holy grail . Easily accessible through Copley station. Dropped by the other day and was amazed by the customer service. I knew of the brand a bit but the Sales Associate made me feel welcome and was full of tips, product knowledge, and suggestions. It takes a real expert to sell to a sales person. This is going to be my new go to place for gifts. I did not catch their name but the person who helped me was wearing some amazing braids and told me they worked there for a long time and it really showed. Safety measures for COVID were in place and the best part of most skincare stores is that they have a sink so if you wanted to wash your hands you could. My review is totally overdue, but I had such a great experience shopping at Fresh's flagship location. Momo, the sales associate who worked with me, was extremely knowledgable, patient, and attentive. It was really relaxing to shop in the store, and I left with great products. Everything smells heavenly. Highly recommend stopping by if you're in Boston -- and definitely ask for Momo! Lovely hidden gem on Newbury street! Joanne was a treat and was very patient as I described all of my skin concerns and helped me find a super pretty, hydrating rose moisturizer that will live on my vanity and on my instagram for a very long time. Knowledgeable staff, beautiful clean interior, and the cutest packaging!! Definitely will visit again! The employees were really nice and helpful and they great perfumes. When I\u2019m just to have a look see, and what do you know... they have a ton of great skin care products. Ended up purchasing a few things I can\u2019t wait to try out. Great virtual customer service! I was served remotely by Abeje and she was super helpful and attentive. She helped me pick a new frame by asking the right questions and showing me options on Zoom. I am currently waiting for my frame to arrive but I am confident we picked the right frame for me. Love my Illesteva glasses. Incredibly friendly and helpful staff. They fixed the temples without asking when and where I had bought my glasses. They first tried to fix it on site, and when they saw they didn't have the necessary tools, they sent it in for me and the glasses were even sent back to my home free of charge because I couldn't make it back to the shop. NY office wouldn't take back defective glasses.  Crack was off of screw when manufactured.  wanted to charge me for repair Utterly incompetent, completely useless and very rude guy at the counter. Glasses looked good though. Shame. The most amazing employees. So cool and helpful The whole crew was fantastic, especially Nicole. Extremely helpful and were able to rush order a piece for me which arrived in 3 days just before Christmas. Will definitely be giving my business there again. This place is fantastic\u2014definitely my go-to spot for all things classy. Last year, Nicky, the owner, helped me pick out an amazing Christmas gift for my mom (safe to say, I won Christmas). Recently, I realized that all the cool people seem to have gold chains, so I went back. I spent quite a bit of Nicky\u2019s time making sure I found the right one, and she was incredibly patient as we looked at both heirloom pieces and catalog options. In the end, she hooked me up with a great deal on a chain that\u2019s, in my humble opinion, awesome. It was custom-sized to fit me perfectly, not just something off the shelf. Nicky even followed up with a text afterward to make sure I was happy with it. Top-notch service all around! Beautiful place with beautiful stuff. Also the guy with the British accent is very helpful and sweet.\n\nThat being said\u2026\n\nI bought a bracelet for my girlfriend and asked what it would cost to have it altered. The woman who owns the store said she could give it to the jewelers to have them appraise the alterations, and that she\u2019d call me back in a few days with the price. Awesome\u2026\n\nExpecting a call soon after, I forget about it and go on with my life. 2 weeks later, having not received a single call or text, I remembered \u201coh, they have my bracelet, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\nI call and the other owner, the husband, says \u201cohhhh yea. My wife gave you a call the other day. (She didn\u2019t) They finished the bracelet, you can come pick it up.\u201d\n\nUmm\u2026.. that wasn\u2019t the deal. So I head over.\n\nThe wife is there, and when I ask why I wasnt contacted at any point (NOT EVEN TO TELL ME TO PICK IT UP!!!!!) she has some story about how the jewelers messed up and just did it without checking. Thats fine, I understand, but then when I ask why I wasn\u2019t contacted AT ALL about this, she says very condescendingly \u201cwell what. Were you gonna take it somewhere else?\u201d\n\nSo, I just paid it so I didn\u2019t have to argue and decided to leave this review instead. :) I love this store! I recently moved back to Boston and got some stunning earrings. I did not feel pressured in any way and was genuinely helped in finding a style that worked for me. Nicole was super helpful and I love that it is a family business! Amazing service, very nice and flexible tone. It made everything incredibly easy and convenient, even from an out of state-purchase. Hope everything was just as well-received on my end. Looking forward to stepping in that place again in the fall! Great cut from Elle! I was a walk-in and took a shot, and I\u2019m glad I did. He put some awesome layers in my hair (which hadn\u2019t been cut in about nine months), and it\u2019s much more manageable. Will come back for sure! I walked in off the street for a cut and got sat with Razor. He proceeded to give me the cleanest cut of my life. I normally ask for a pretty basic style and square off the back but he suggested to go with a taper and it came out incredible. Will definitely be making Razor my go to barber going forward. Save yourself the nightmare\u2014your dignity, pride, and wallet will thank you. This was, without a doubt, the worst haircut experience I\u2019ve ever had. Not only was it outrageously expensive, but it was also physically painful. My hair kept getting stuck in the razor, and instead of slowing down, the stylist would just yank it out. He seemed to be in a rush, despite having no other clients after me, and kept hitting my ears with the comb repeatedly. To make matters worse, he made inappropriate and degrading comments about women, making the experience even more uncomfortable. If you value your hair, your peace of mind, and your hard-earned money, avoid this place at all costs. Nick is a talented professional with an eye for style and personality - I left the haircut with an incredible boost in confidence both internally and externally. I asked for a buzz cut, simple in theory, and Nick gave me one of the best buzzes I've seen around: personalized and detailed. Sharp in every sense of the word, would highly recommend. Nick is a very knowledgeable barber. He makes sure he understands what you want and gives you recommendations on how to get there. One of the most detailed haircuts I\u2019ve gotten and he makes sure you\u2019re comfortable along the way. Recommend 100% The girl at the front desk (January 3, 2025 around 11:00 am) made my shopping experience awkward and uncomfortable. Her attitude, staring problem past the socially acceptable amount, and following me around the store made me disengage and refuse to spend $200+ on a store that has poor customer service etiquette. I hope she finds the help she needs and confidence to not be so intimidated by the average customer. 06082023: Back in Boston shufflin' down Newbury Street. The female figure and I were stopped by the street mannequin with the black and white dress, stylish.\nOthers inside were equally stylish along with some well-shaped A-frame/cut skirts for summer outings. We had great service, but we also don't monkey around \"looking.\" If we're in the store, then something's getting purchased. A long-time established store with an owner that has seen the evolution of Newbury Street over time had fun stories to share. Why 4 and not 5 stars? The label said disappointingly to me for various reasons \"Made in China.\" I think a similar dress could be made/assembled in the US, and that would be for me at least preferred. If that doesn't concern you, then enjoy the pleasingly unique, clean-lined styles. For sure, you'll look great at your next gathering. Stumbled across this store to buy a graduation dress for my mother. The designs of the clothes are beautiful and unique! But the materials and craftsmanship are definitely not worth the price point. Mum wore her dress for half a day and the zipper broke! Manager refused to provide a refund and was quite rude.\nWould recommend if you are looking for something with a different design and don\u2019t mind paying an extreme premium. Definitely not if looking for quality and service. Great shop!\nJust bought a dress for a formal wedding and it is amazing. Fairly priced $400.\n\nThe girls working are very helpful. I am defnitely coming back. Great spot to bring my women when I\u2019m in town. Been bringing girls here since 2005 Too overpriced, and some products dont even have a price tag. Tell me why they charged me $16 for one pack of Sa Yang Buldak ramen that I can easy buy at Star Market for only $8.99. Also they charge $1 dollar for one plastic bag. Also, it seems they dont follow the prices on the only items that have a price tag on them. Watch out for the prices when they are scanning the items Local Gem . Open 24 hours even on holidays . Has a very large selection of snacks , candy , common household items, and a whole bunch of international items . Super convenient corner shop can\u2019t go wrong Found a gem in the confusion of an area that's new to me. Visiting from Maine while my bf gets treatment at Dana Farber. Got into town really late & needed food. Thankfully this place was open & not too far from our hotel. The guys that work there were super friendly and funny. The place has a great selection of groceries, cleaning products, snacks, and just all sorts of things you may need or didn't know you needed. Of course the prices are high but everything is these days. Besides you're paying for convenience. The price of fuel is driving the cost of goods and services way up so that along with the high rent of the area you're going to pay more. Definitely stop in to support this local gem! I would give five stars for their wide selection and friendly staff, but everything here is so overpriced. It seems like they just add $2 onto every item. The bananas they sell at the cashier are probably the biggest rip off, you could easily go to Whole Foods down the street and save money. You know it's overpriced when Whole Foods is the cheaper option. After all, it is a convenience store but if you're on a budget I would avoid this place. Really excellent experience using this shop for Bounce Luggage Storage. I would definitely use this location again and recommend to a friend. I\u2019ve never used Bounce before and I wanted an option for a place to leave my bags after landing in Boston and exploring the city before my friends got in. Employees were very friendly. My bags were untouched and in the same place when I returned for pick up. Thank you  Symphony Market! Kaitlin is an absolute gem! She really knows her stuff and went above and beyond to help me track down the last remaining bottle of Parfums de Marly Althair. Her product knowledge, professionalism, and genuine enthusiasm made the whole experience amazing. If you\u2019re shopping at Bluemercury and want expert guidance with a personal touch, ask for Kaitlin \u2014 she\u2019ll take care of you! I told the girl working exactly what skin problems I was having, and that I wanted just\none product and not a whole regimen or anything, and the associates suggestion actually works. Pricey but it did as advertised. It\u2019s a stick for fading dark spots which is interesting because I\u2019ve never seen one before, and I don\u2019t really like serums. And it has been working too. Very pleased My wife had an extremely bad experience at the Newbury St location.  The associate was a bald women who was dressed sloppy and inappropriate with a terrible attitude .  She was unprofessional and racist towards my wife and her friend.  The associate was condescending in the way she spoke to clients as well as other associates.   You should be ashamed of the people you have representing a store with such expensive products. If we are paying a substantial amount of money for things the associates should be dressed professionally and not like they rolled out of bed The sales associates were chatting in back. After several minutes looking at Chantecaille one associate finally came over and was very unprofessional and rude. I left. The store is dark and poorly laid out. This was lunch time on a Friday. I was excited to try this store since I have sensitive skin and they seem to have a lot of options. The store doesn\u2019t have a clear layout so I had to ask for help. They do not sell EltaMD in store, which is absolutely fine, but did not offer to help me with other sunscreen options. It didn\u2019t seem busy as I was the only person in the store so I tried to engage again but they turned around to do some paperwork. Disappointing encounter - hopefully this is a one time instance? The customer support was great! They fixed my glasses quick and easy and was generous to change my nose pads free of charge! Highly recommend Friendly, knowledgeable, super cute frame selection, and I got my glasses in an hour :) Thank you to the whole staff! I would have missed the rest of the competition without you! ( Visiting Boston and lost my glasses on vacation.) You will find the nicest people ever working here. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because their frame selection is bad.  Yes there are tons of options. But none of them are meant for people with strong prescriptions.   LensCrafters focuses on the current trend which is large frames.   I wish the ditched brands that make cheap low quality frames. They can use that space in their store for higher quality frames for strong prescriptions. I am visiting Boston from Australia and on my first day here the frame of my glasses broke. The hotel recommended LensCrafters and the lovely lady there had my glasses fixed within minutes and didn\u2019t charge me anything. It was a great welcome to Boston for me! Thank you very much - wonderful service. Booked a self pay eye exam on the LensCrafters website. The site directed me to their previous location, which is no longer open. Had to walk in very cold and windy weather to the new location. Self pay prices are not listed in a transparent manner on the website and vary widely based on location. My previous LensCrafters in Manhattan cost less than this Boston location (absurd). Ultimately, when voicing these concerns in a polite way, I could sense immediate attitude from the second receptionist, so I cancelled the appt and left. Go to Warby Parker and save some money. Luke at the Shade Store on Newbury was the easiest, most creative person to work with on my new curtain project! He was able to see my vision and find the perfect color for me! I am so thrilled! Horrible experience. Multiple remeasures had to be done. First order came with a wrong print and overall horrible look. Company apologized and offered to remake using a different fabric and style. I accepted remake and used renderings they made to pick a different print/style. Well, second time the style was wrong, the rendering color didn\u2019t match the fabric. I demanded refund - company refused to issue. They offered a re-make #3 for which they are trying to change me now again. What a scam! Excellent all around. Service, timeliness, ease, professionalism, product! Everything 100%. Couldn't recommend more.  Beautiful window treatments. Disappointing experience. First set of shades were delivered broken so we had to wait all over again. Second set of shades were finally delivered but with stains on multiple sections of the fabric, wrong length (supposed to be 3 inches from top of ceiling), and no blackout liner (when we purchased and ordered it). On top of that, the hardware is not even remotely hidden. Overall a scam for the price paid. Stay away as they clearly have severe production issues. First cancelled multiple appointments for installation while leaving gigantic wrong size curtain rods in our hallway for MONTHS and refusing to pick them up. Then curtains were finally installed but were crushed and wrinkled - refused to address this at the time of the installation but scheduled an appointment to come a different day - and they did not show up for this. Unlike some of the other reviews\u2014 I was there with my son. He received excellent customer service!! They were very respectful and helpful!!! They did not have the chrome he was looking for but not their fault. He did find great sweatshirt!! On the 1st of February I ordered the angel necklace priced at \u00a334. I have still not recied it. Could you tell me how long it will be please. great store with helpful staff! i scored a great sale on a pair of boots here awhile back and will definitely be returning! The best customer shopping experience ive had in a long time. Doug was able to help me track down an item ive been searching for and really went above and beyond.  N management really made me feel special being from out of state. Thanks again guys. I\u2019ve tried so many times to establish what I ordered from them, but they send the same reply that isn\u2019t relevant Pageo delivers quality jewelry with unique designs; however, I would think again before placing a custom piece that\u2019s time-sensitive. As returning customers, it took a total of 4 months before we finally picked up my anniversary ring after it was made the THIRD time, as the jeweler was not able to replicate the store model. Of course we didn\u2019t have a big rush in our case, but something to note for those who do. If you are looking for the best in customer service, quality and superior design, then Pageo is for you! The overall experience along with the most gorgeous jewelry made a happy occasion so memorable.  I will never go anywhere else! I was new to Boston and someone happened to mention this place for a repair on my wedding band. Unfortunately, I happened to lose a diamond the day before moving 1500 miles away from my current jeweler. I was nervous trusting another jeweler but not only were they professional, kind, and knowledgeable they assured me that they would take care of my ring! They treated my ring with as much love and care as I do. The price was fantastic and the turn around time was great. I will definitely be visiting again to add to my collection! Fantastic Experience.  Two thumbs way up.\n\nUrsula is a master of her craft.  She helped me along, was super patient with me in explanations and understanding the difference between specifics,  hunted out just the right stones, and then got me to a beautiful final ring that's unique for me and my soon-to-be.  Love it. Excellent personal service.  Pageo worked with me to reset several pieces of my jewelry into more modern settings and repaired several pieces.  All of the work was done beautifully. We used Winston flowers through our venue Mistral for our wedding. They were awesome as they worked with us within our budget to make our wedding dreams come true and made amazing table scapes for our event. We appreciate the work done by Winston flowers in adding to our amazing day! Terrible service guys!\nI walked in to order a bouquet for my mother for her birthday. The stuff was super rude and told me that they don\u2019t have the flowers I want available and overall treated me like I\u2019m nothing. Until I told them that I am trying to spend $350, when I mentioned the amount suddenly all of the staff came to up (3 people) and were offering me the flowers that they told me they didn\u2019t have minutes ago before finding out my budget. Customer service is total garbage, I do not recommend going there. For such upscale place I was expecting customer service be on a certain level but I guess they don\u2019t share the same interest. Amazing customer service and nice variety of plants + flowers.\nThey help me create a beautiful bouquet for my friend within my budget.  Definitely coming again It\u2019s difficult to express how outstanding of a job the Winston team (Molly, Bryan + team) did for our engagement party at the Isabella Stewart this fall. We had reached out to several other florists around New England, so we had many other floral studios to compare to, and Winston immediately stood out with how customer friendly and professional they were to work with. We felt very comfortable working with Winston and the team was incredibly accommodating and easy to work with. Most importantly, the floral arrangements were STUNNING and exceeded any expectations we could have had for our vision. I could not be happier with choosing Winston. Molly and Bryan - thank you, thank you, thank YOU. My brother ordered me birthday flowers as surprise and said that the service was great. So can\u2019t comment too much on that.\n\nHowever, the flowers I received did not look fresh at all and were honestly very disappointing. Half of the roses in the bouquet looked really sad.\n\nI had heard of Winston Flowers before in a positive light and never expected to receive this kind quality from a luxe florist for a bouquet that probably cost 100+. My friend and I had a very nice time here for a deluxe manicure, complete with a moisturizing hand mask. I love the Miniluxe polish selection (there\u2019s even a color called \u201cthe Big Dig\u201d). The interiors are super cute and clean, and May was lovely! I was excited to give MiniLuxe a try, given the claim that the performance plus dazzle dry polish option is durable and can hold up to gel in a way standard polishes do not- I rarely seem to get through a day before a traditional polish begins to chip. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be much better. Professional and friendly service,  and the nails looked nice out the door- and still do- but sadly,  just barely 24 hours later they are already beginning to chip, so I doubt they are going to hold up to the claims. No duress, just driving, reading, unloading the dishwasher, sleep...\n\nI also opted for the \"ridge filler\" add on,  which claims to improve durability. Came here as a walk in for an eyebrow wax and pedicure and am very pleased with the outcome of both! My eyebrows are nice and shaped and the employee was very meticulous with her work. I am unsure of her name but would highly recommend her! Aly did my pedicure and she did such a great job. She was very sweet and detailed with her work. I would highly recommend this place!! Best nail salon experience ever - this has become my go-to spot!\n\nAnthony is an exceptional manager, some of the best customer service skills I have ever seen, and always helps me pick a color.\n\nMaricruz is a true expert when it comes to waxing, my eyebrows have never looked better after leaving there!\n\nI can understand that the price point is on the higher side, but when it comes to the cleanliness, customer service, and quality - it's worth every dollar!! Nhi was so nice and really took her time to make sure the manicure was perfect. She also let me try on the color before fully committing to it. The salon is also very clean and everyone who works there is so kind. Will absolutely be back! Want to give a special thanks to Kimberly.  I called looking for the Cavalry jacket and she sent it out immediately. Her customer service was excellent. We look forward to visiting your store soon. While the store is small is feels cozy, and the staff are incredibly kind and welcoming. They won't hesitate to help you with a problem and they have a decent selection for the size of the store. The store manager is a professional, helpful guy who runs a clean store. He is great at what he does. He also keeps a great staff who are all helpful and friendly as well. Fantastic store! I didn't go to look for large clothing items but their selection of accessories was quite good. Staff was friendly even on a cold rainy day. Great place to try out the fit of Barbour jackets. Great team of salespeople. Very helpful. One of the nicest luxury stores on Newbury! Lina & Thomas went above & beyond to make our experience wonderful Go see Thomas, the store manager! He was amazing and very attentive. I had an issue with my order delivery, and he was able to take care of everything with an ease. He was such a pleasure to work with! great customer service and staff! They're absolutely wonderful, kind and knowledgeable.  very happy client! Didnt get much of a good vibe being in there. Whole time, the guy at the store had a stank face while packing our order. Im not at all sure how long this dress shop has been at this location however I do know the day program for poor and homeless women that I attend just across from them at the corner of Berkley and Newbury has been there since 1986. The smoking area  for this program is directly across from Valentino, we learned recently that Valentino is part of a neighborhood association that is actively trying to shut the day program down! We are told they regularly call the police on us for ...I dont even know what? Smoking while poor? Being too Transgender in the presence of a designer label? Please Valentino?! LEAVE US ALONE! Super great service everytime I shop, lovely store! I don\u2019t usually write reviews, but this boutique absolutely deserves one. From the moment I stepped in, I was impressed by the exceptional service. Tita, in particular, helped me gain a deeper appreciation for this brand. The fabrics are luxurious, the cashmeres are divine, and everything in the store reflects top-tier quality. The owner was also incredibly welcoming, and the entire team, including Tita, is truly amazing. This is a white-glove experience from start to finish\u2014highly recommend it! Just walked into this location while walking around Newbury street. My dad was wearing a pair of your sneakers, yet not one of the 4-5 associates on the floor could bother to look up and ask us if we even needed anything.  When I brought this to the associates attention they literally stared at me, and said nothing. We've spent a great deal of money at your store. The customer service at this store is a joke and so are the sales associates. Do better. Very unhelpful server, we had to chase our order and yet we bought two pairs of shoes only on that day. I received no email ( I am in their data base) no tracking number. I had to call and chase my order that they didn\u2019t know anything about it. The men who work there are not only rude but very passive and stuck up. A little reminder that they are the one who are serving us and that their salary is paid by customers like us, no need to try so hard.\nThe number associated with Loro Piana  in Boston is this from the photo. It\u2019s a Spanish speaker women who I couldn\u2019t even hear. This is sloppy disappointing and it was a horrible experience. Someone overseeing this, do something about it or this store will end up shutting down. I wouldn't give a one star if it were at all possible worst experience with the manager at the newbury st location Sheila Gillagan very unprofessional and rude trying to help one of our customer replace a pair of pants that discolored and shrank we followed the care label on the garment you would think a high end store like Loro Piana would bend over backwards to help replace the item not so in this case you should think twice of doing business with them The lady kept bringing me the wrong shoes while keeping me waiting for very very long time (no one was at the store except me),, at the end she pretended that she ordered my request and that it will arrive within 3 days. I kept waiting for the message but nothing happened. I called and they said i will receive a message, 3 weeks later nothing received ( obviously nothing ordered).. Very very unprofessional, not coming to this store again. I had the most amazing experience here that I could\u2019ve ever asked for. I had my mom\u2019s Cartier love bracelet in half in my hands and was seeing if somehow, it could be repaired without it being molded into a new bracelet. This piece has been so special to me over the years because she passed 18 years ago & it was just sitting in my jewelry box, broken. Jesse took great care of me and with one look, she said, \u201cif the person I\u2019m thinking of can\u2019t fix it, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll recommend. I\u2019ll be in touch\u201d. She called me not even a week later to tell me, this person was able to REPAIR it and NOT re-mold it. The price was extremely affordable and she took care of me. Within less than a week, she called me to tell me it was ready for pick up. They put it on me when I picked it up and I\u2019m just so thankful I finally found a jeweler that was able to repair such an important piece to me. They handled it with such care and of importance- I will be going back and if I could give them more than 5 stars I would. Thanks to Jesse, I\u2019m able to still feel like I have a piece of my mom physically with me! Highly recommend this Boston Shreve, Crump & Low - especially Glenn who took the time to educate and show our 24 year old son some watches. Glenn was friendly and knowledgeable and we appreciate the time he took with our son (even though we did not purchase anything). Not all Newbury St jewelry/watch boutiques are so welcoming & friendly. We will definitely be back and will recommend to friends & family. Thank you for such a lovely experience. Thanks Shreve, Crump, and Low for helping me to get one of my grail watch. Had the opportunity to work with Jenn Baldwin and can\u2019t ask for a better service. Communication is very prompt and transaction went thru very smoothly. Jenn was also keep me posted on the package tracker and it arrives safely without any issue. Thanks again and Looking forward for future purchase. My wife and I brought our son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, D, to SC&L yesterday to look at watches on the second floor since we purchased watches for our other two daughters-in-law, and want to continue this tradition.\n\nWe were met by Glenn who patiently took us around the floor, showing D the makes/models which could work with our price range and her aesthetic preferences.\n\nContrast this with the Rolex boutique where the guard informed us we would need to wait outside until a salesperson was available. Most Rolex boutiques don\u2019t actually have any inventory for sale, so waiting in the cold outside wasn\u2019t going to happen.\n\nShreve, Crump, & Low on Newbury has a terrific selection of high-end watches available for sale, and Glenn could not have possibly been more professional or personable. I had a great experience working with Jared on a recent purchase at Shreve, Crump & Low. Jared was knowledgeable about the various products and he was patient with me and professional as I considered the vast inventory of options (over multiple visits). Great store! The first store that carry good tons of adidas. People are super friendly and the store is just really dope. If you want ultra boost, iniki, gazelle, NMDs, adidas clothing, and concepts gear just hit up the store and poke around. Had a great experience. AB and Manny took care of my boys, made them feel special and gave us great service. We bought a bunch of stuff and will be back. This store is a totally different store from the other one up the street. The staff is extremely nice and welcoming. It\u2019s also very small store. You can quickly see every thing they have. The set up of the store is awesome. The people are awesome even if you don\u2019t like Adidas, I would recommend just taking a walk through something by jump out at you. The staff was extremely personable and willing to help with any question you might have. I wish I would\u2019ve taken some pictures. My apologies, but go check it out. It\u2019ll be well worth it. Just shopped here this past weekend. I brought my nephew for a new pair of sneakers for the start of his new school year. We were helped by AB. He was so helpful, kind, and extremely nice. I hope he is there every time we go back in the future! This is a great store! Feels like a community and the employees are very helpful.  Shoutout to AB for always taking care of me and remembering me every time I go to the store. You will find items here you don\u2019t find anywhere else. 10/10 Recommend I had the pleasure of working with Victoria when I was looking for a couple pieces to build my bracelet stack. She was extremely knowledgeable about the brand, professional and listened to what I was looking for to ensure we found the right pieces. We tried on several pieces. I initially purchased one and then waiting some time to decide on the other one and to my luck a new size (medium love bracelet) launched in fall 2024 and it was perfect! I also was informed asap even months after I had visited the store which displayed Victoria\u2019s care for customers because she thought of me and even after that I was invited to come back into the store to have my jewelry cleaned. Thank you for your excellent service and I look forward to continuing working with you! I reached a goal, and to celebrate this milestone, I wanted to make it memorable\u2014with Cartier. I chose a ring, a timeless piece that goes with everything.\n\nWalking into Cartier, I had a few apprehensions, fearing we might be treated condescendingly. But we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service. We were pampered and served with professionalism. For a first experience in an ultra-luxury boutique, I was very satisfied. Honestly, I had preconceived notions, but the staff there serve all types of clients\u2014from those dressed head-to-toe in LV to people in casual tracksuits. No judgments are made, and everyone receives service worthy of the Cartier name.\n\nI also wanted to have my ring engraved, but the only one able to do it was Mr. Wayne. We were advised to text him on his day off to ensure it would be done by Monday, before our return to Montreal. What incredible service\u2014he kindly agreed and completed it within the timeframe, even offering us a little cleaning kit, just as I had hoped.\n\nTop-notch service, worthy of a luxury house\u2014fun and warm. I highly recommend Cartier Boston. Looking forward to visiting again for my next milestone :)\n\nOh, and a small detail I really appreciated\u2014having made a few trips to their boutique, everyone remembered my name. A small gesture that brought me a lot of joy :) Recently visited and picked up a Tank as a gift for myself- was very happy with not only the product- but the process as well. Laurie made the buying experience very easy- it did not take long, but did not feel rushed- and we had good conversation while she handled the paperwork/bagging! Thank you Laurie! A very welcoming place. The staff is nice and helpful. Preferably to make an appointment. Very busy on weekends. Our consultant was busy that day but after 20 min wait we got an assistance. I was looking for a mini bag but couldn't make a decision and didn't buy anything. They have a nice collection of accessories and do not forget to visit the second floor with more beautiful items. After a sizing issue with a ring, Jai and her team reminded me why you shop at places like Cartier: the service & support are as amazing as their products which is unmatched!  She was amazing and I am very happy with the purchase (and additional purchases)! I don\u2019t normally post reviews but I must say my stylist at Avanti Salon on Newbury St. in Boston is fantastic. You can find her on the Avanti site under Jae Correa. She colored/blended my hair perfectly and gave me exactly what I asked for. The most unique part is that she had the confidence to direct me to my vision by implementing her own knowledge & expertise. J has always made me feel comfortable & confident during and after the appointment. Plus the salons atmosphere is relaxing & they have great coffee! Highly recommend!. Message her at @juliajcorrea Went to this salon for the first time for highlights after seeing the great reviews, and I\u2019ll definitely be going back! Chris was amazing\u2014he took the time to chat through what I wanted, made sure we were on the same page, and got the color absolutely perfect. Great experience overall! Cristian (Chris) is one of my favorite hairstylists I\u2019ve met in a long time and I move a lot and I\u2019ve tried many over the past decade. He took the time to really listen to my concerns and my desires and he gave me the most perfect bouncy 90s layers haircut and really nice highlights. He was a joy to work with and you would be luckily to get him. Chris cut my hair and did an AMAZING job. He\u2019s super detailed and does an incredible blowout as well. 10/10!! I was not feeling confident about my hair lately and this really turned everything around for me and left me feeling beautiful! I never ever get my haircut EVER! I wanted long layers like the 90\u2019s supermodels - my hair is VERY long, straight, and zero depth so I knew this was going to be a big change. Rob absolutely NAILED IT! LOVED the style. 10/10 no notes! Salon Capri on Newbury is a easy to access.  The stylist I have had for some time continue her practice there.  I enjoy my time there as the focus narrows giving me a great hairstyle! Its on Newbury Street what else do you want!!! Booked for my mom who is not so salon person but she loved it. Nick did a fantastic job and she is more than happy. He just understood what she needs and he executed like a pro. Can't wait to book for me now My boyfriend and I were in a pinch to get haircuts before a wedding we had, and we called Salon Capri who were able to schedule us for the next day. The morning of our appointments, the front desk admin called me to share the stylist I was scheduled with called in sick. They were able to schedule me with another stylist at the same time, and also offered me a complementary hair treatment for the inconvenience. I was totally floored by this amazing customer service!\n\nI got my haircut my Cameron and my boyfriend got his done by Marisa. They both did an absolutely amazing job! We are so happy with our new looks. Thanks Salon Capri! Wow!! First time trying this place. Nick was my stylist and not only was he funny, kind, and very outgoing, definitely one of the best hair cuts and styles I\u2019ve ever had. I have a long red hair that\u2019s very fine but a lot of it. A good hairstylist knows how to cut hair to make it sit just right. Four days later, it\u2019s still resting perfectly and I\u2019m terrible at styling myself. The staff was all warm and inviting to this newcomer. Sunny & warm day on Newberry Street, parking was quite easy. Pricing was very reasonable considering the quality. Like the review mentioned before me, I also had my appointment cancelled at the last minute. What irked me the most was the fact that the hair stylist did not appreciate that I was coming from 3 hours away to see her. My time is just as valuable as hers and should not be taken for granted. If you want my advice, look for a salon who see you as a human being with actual commitments, not just a number. Beautiful store, wonderful customer service. Susan is a great salesperson to work with. Thank you! Nice staff , but to my surprise they tell\nMe that the alteration will take 4 weeks\nTheir tailor is on vacation and they will try to see if they have a solution for me\nVery disappointed with the brand , I have been a customer more than 15 years and this is the first time that I see a store tell you to wait for 4 weeks\nManagement should   go out of their way to speed things up and figure out a solution Awesome experience working with Eddie. Looking forward to my next visit! So much better than Hermes. Eddie Jones is awesome. Very helpful. Great service Dr. Chan was fantastic! Very thorough and felt like I was actually getting the best eye health check and not just passed through rapid tests to get me in and out. He answered all my questions thoughtfully and was clearly an expert in all regards. If you can go here, definitely do it. I have been going to Studio Optics for a few years now. Dr. Chan is always very professional, efficient, and kind. He makes having an eye exam seamless and easy! Optical also has a great variety of glasses to pick from. Would recommend Dr. Chan and his practice!! I have seen Dr Chan for 3 years, and he is wonderful. He is efficient and professional and kind. He always gets to all of my questions and is thorough with the eye exam.  I cannot recommend him more!! Dr. Chan is THE BEST! I've been seeing him for several years and he is always so kind and explains anything I have questions about. Scheduling is easy, and the person who works at the desk is very sweet and caring. Everyone should come to this eye doctor. Dr. Chan and his team has seen me for three years.  He has been consistent and helpful.  Thanks for the thorough eye examination.  It has been quick and easy to book an appointment.  The eyeglass selection has been great plus the options.  The sharing of eye and vision knowledge was good.  I am grateful for everything he and his team does. Love this store! The quality of clothing is outstanding. There is nothing better than pima cotton for a baby. Customer service has always been excellent in store and when ordering online. Highly recommend. George was recommended to me by my sister who sees him for his color expertise. I do not color my hair anymore but I\u2019ve been getting extensions since I was 18 years old. I\u2019m 33 now\u2014 that\u2019s a lot of extensions. I\u2019ve tried every extension on the market and had never heard of nano laserbeam extensions until my sister mentioned them to me. I was immediately ready to try them since I had been using weft or tape ins for years and was always self conscious about the tapes showing. I don\u2019t mind that people know I have extensions, but I do feel uncomfortable when it looks like I have scotch tape all over my head \ud83e\udee0. Driving into the city for hair appointments feels overwhelming for me, but I went in for a consult and knew I was in the right hands. George underpromises and overdelivers by a long shot. He took his time with my hair, made sure it was perfectly installed, and blended the hair so beautifully and meticulously. I love that I can pull my hair back and braid it without worrying. Yes, George is a great hair stylist and has worked his ass off with continuing education, always staying up to par. But more notably, he\u2019s an incredible human with and incredible story and everyone would benefit from knowing him. Wherever George is, I will follow!!!!!!! Sal has kept my hair stylish and easy to maintain for at least 15 years!  For color, no one has been better than Amanda! She is terrific at suggesting tweaks to my highlights to keep them interesting and looking great.  This is why I keep going back! In addition to being talented, they are both  sweet and wonderful people! I contacted George a few weeks ago about the combline method of extensions as I have the dreaded cowlick at the crown and my hair is fine. I have had k-tip extensions for years, but those can't be placed very high, and my goal was to better hide the extensions at the back/crown of my head using combline. George did combline for me about 3 weeks ago, and the results exceeded my expectations. George managed to successfully hide all extensions along the crown of my head, and also placed long layers around my face, something I have never had due to my own hair being shorter with breakage/thinning in this area. I am still stunned by how amazing my results are! I can now wear my hair down whenever I want to, and straight which wasn't the case before combline since if I was outside on a windy day I would be concerned my extensions would show, and I wore my hair curly or wavy most of the time since that better hid the k-tip bonds. I have received so many compliments on my hair. At about 3 weeks since the appointment, my hair still looks great with good retention. I also want to add that George is an extremely kind and compassionate person with incredible attention to detail. George, thank you so much for helping my hair look amazing and I look forward to working with you. It\u2019s all about excellence with this salon. I got delicate color and a cut that somehow looks good in a ponytail when you don\u2019t have time to properly dry your hair.  The color is so perfect and the cut makes my low-touch style look like actual style. I\u2019ve been getting so many compliments about how I look, and the only thing that\u2019s different is my hair. A thousand percent worth the drive up from the NYC suburbs. It\u2019s right in the middle of Newbury street. If you have the opportunity, treat yourself to lunch and shopping and make a day of it. I first saw George for my haircut in 2012 and ever since he is the only one I trust my hair with. George is simply the best! He is very good at his job and can see what hairstyle looks good me . After every hairstyle my hair looked like a million bucks :) Even after moving to Connecticut I still drove to Boston to get my hair done by him!\n\nGeorge is a wonderful person too, it\u2019s always a pleasure to see him. I\u2019ll miss that I can\u2019t see him often after my relocation, but I think I\u2019ll fly down to Boston just to get my hair cut by him ! This is now my favourite hair Salon in the city! 10/10. Bella not only nailed my hair but also gave me the a relaxing head massage while washing it\u2014like, which other hair salon in boston does this? I appreciate how my requirements were carefully attended. I got exactly what I wanted\u2014long, voluminous hair with perfect curls at the ends.\n\nThe staff? So friendly, always smiling :)\nThe perks? Coffee, wine, and treats included in the service!\n\nGreat salon experience\u2014highly recommend!! All around great experience! Gaston did an amazing job on my balayage, the salon is beautiful and all around great vibes with the music and team of stylists chatting in French & Spanish and helping each other with clients. Would recommend to anyone! Gaston did my colour and cut and he was excellent! He absolutely knows how blend colors and give you a natural look and is a wizard when it comes to cuts as well!  The entire staff and salon was upbeat , social and friendly ! They have an amazing patio and service with drinks/coffees/pasteries/cheese board. Everyone is Super welcoming and do not push products on you ! They truly enjoy being there. Would HIGHLY recommend this salon! Gaston is not only a wonderful person but also highly talented and attentive. He truly listens to what you want. I had a perfect afternoon in his hands and left his salon with the most beautiful highlights and cut. I'm so happy to have found this gem and will definitely be back! Gaston is fantastic! He truly listened to what I want and gave me the perfect color and cut! The staff is so friendly too! This salon is highly recommended :) I love the Tie Bar. My fiance and I are big on getting dressed up and every time we go to the Tie Bar to pick up accessories for him, we are welcomed like old friends. The people who work at the Tie Bar are so attentive and make us feel truly cared for. Today we went in to get a tie and pocket square for our wedding and Steven was delightful and wonderful to work with. My dress is not traditional and he and I roamed the store, looking for ties that would compliment it, all while hiding my pictures and swatch from my fiance. My fiance then got to pick from a while bunch of options, and we went home with two ties and two pocket squares. As we walked back to the car, we discussed how we've never had a bad experience at the Tie Bar and how stellar their customer service always is. Ties are inexpensive and look great. Staff has a great eye for matching colors and patterns. I've had ties from here for several years and while they are not top of the line, they have lasted and look nice. I've gotten many complements and plan to shop here again whenever I need a tie. The Tie Bar has been the most amazing company to work with for our wedding and more! I have never purchased anything from a company and had the experience Stephen Keary provided. He went way out of his way to track down four matching ties that were at four different tie bar locations and had them shipped to me even though I was on the other side of the country!! He turned my Covid wedding prep grief into something I hadn\u2019t expected. Over the phone, he truly displayed genuine enthusiasm to help me out. By far the BEST company I have had to work with!!! I came in on a holiday weekend shopping for ties for my groomsmen and I was not disappointed.  Darren was cheerful, welcoming, and had a keen eye for picking out the ties I needed (ultimately chose the polka dot version).  I bought all five right then and there and he helped me ship them to my groomsmen who are scattered all over the country.  Tie Bar was great and Darren was awesome.  Very highly recommended. Extremely helpful and insightful group of people working at this company.  They have a wide variety of ties and other accessories to choose from. I highly recommend working with The Tie Bar.  I have been here several times to purchase ties and each time the employees go above and beyond to help me out. super creepy vibes from the guys who worked here, called my girlfriend beautiful and proceeded to follow us around the store about a foot away from us at all times. then 3-4 other guys showed up behind the counter and all stared at us. we left pretty quickly. also SUPER overpriced. Great store, customer service is very, Evan was the coolest guy ever I appreciate his help and generosity. Serena is the best! She is so helpful and friendly, always has a smile on her face. Everyone here is so personable. I highly recommend going this store in particular on the fourth block of Newbury st! I went here today and met ET for the first time I\u2019ve been to other smoke shops around Boston and hands down this is the best one! He was very welcoming as a friend you haven\u2019t seen in forever! His personality was the best to be the front of the store \ud83d\udc95 thank you ET for that experience! Love the atmosphere when I walk in and ET takes care of me! Always have the best experience with him and he always gives me great feed back on what I should get! Will definitely be coming back for his great service! I could have had a great experience here. I came in with dip on my nails and was asked if I wanted dip or gel. I said dip but the guy decided to do gel. When he did the shape of my nails did not ask if it was okay just started painting. When he did the base layer of nail polish he did not ask if it was okay just started painting the tips. Clearly the base was not enough if I can see my natural nail under the polish. He did ask me if I wanted the tip small or large to which I said medium. When he did the tip I asked him for more polish to which he rudely replied \u201cyou said small and now you want more\u201d and I replied no I said medium. He clearly didn\u2019t care about providing a good service but made sure to ask if his tip would be on the credit card. I\u2019m a tipped employee and understand it\u2019s hard not receiving a tip for your service but also understand you should be giving a service the client is happy with. The main concern of this man seemed to be getting me out of his chair as quick as possible. They so nice! I came with no appointment and didn\u2019t have to wait! Mia did an amazing job!! I got powder (SNS) on my nails! Thank you Mia :) The most top notch and luxury nail salon in the Back Bay. The customer service is of the highest quality and everyone here is so nice and professional. I HIGHLY recommend Mike, he shapes my nails to perfection and really takes his time - truly shows how much he values his craft. The salon is very clean and the owner truly cares about customers and ensures their comfort throughout the entire service. I\u2019ve been to various nail salons in the Boston area, but none of them meet the high standards set here. I felt very relaxed and stress free throughout my service. Thank you Jennifer\u2019s Nail & Skin Salon. Went to Jennifer\u2019s for my nails, they look stunning and the salon was INCREDIBLY clean. The entire time I was there, every one was cleaning the place top to bottom. Extremely friendly service from everyone at Jennifer\u2019s, Jennifer herself was incredibly sweet and helpful, too. Highly recommend! My nails are so weak after getting gel nails from here - they drill so hard and fast that your nails will be so thin and brittle. Also not nice customer service here and doesn\u2019t know how to do simple/complex art. I passed by this store on my way back from another suit store bc the first place had a turnaround time of 6 weeks (I needed them sooner). It\u2019s my first time getting a custom anything so I asked a lot of questions (how does this work? what\u2019s the first step?) and Britney was very forgiving and helpful. I wasn\u2019t sure what kind of a fit I was looking for, until Britney started pinning the trial suit in different areas and made suggestions along the way. I ended up getting the shirt as well bc she was so capable and trustworthy, and figured best to get it from someone who clearly knows what they\u2019re doing. I took my father here to get a suit made for fathers day. Daniel has a great sense of style and showed lots of color and style options.  It's a little nerve-racking to have to make so many decisions.. buttons, pockets, cuts, stitches.. I mean things you would never even think about. The attention to detail through out the whole time, from measurement to fitting was remarkable. Besides the end result of a perfectly fitted suit, Daniel made it a great experience. Thank you! Knowledgeable and professional, Britney was able to size me up to measure in a simple and straight forward process, answering all my questions, all in about 45 minutes. I valued her opinion on current trends and took her advice on the lengths. Excited to get my made to measure suit in the coming weeks! Since I have a non-average body build, it is always hard to find the right fit or I need to alter the off-the-rack clothes. Also, women's standard business clothes on the market don't offer a wide variety of colors and styles to choose from. Kashiyama was the right choice for me. I made a few different jackets and a pair of pants. After taking measurements, they were delivered to my home in professional packaging. They made adjustments after the initial completion with no extra charge. They are very-well-tailored and VERY comfortable. They may be relatively pricey, but definitely justifiable. Received my second suit from this location in Boston.  The fabric I chose was outstanding, the overall selection is plentiful and of high quality. The consultation experience was awesome, attentive and detail oriented. I plan on coming here again and again. I had a very positive experience working with Ikhlaus at L\u2019elite Boutique this past Saturday. She was very professional, knowledgeable, patient and listened to my preferences while suggesting a few of her own. Her professionalism and attention to detail were excellent and she provided honest feedback when I asked her opinion. I would highly recommend Ikhlaus; she is absolutely lovely. I went into L'elite Occasions with my daughter who needed a winter cotillion party dress.  We met Violette and she so incredibly patient while my daughter found the right dress. They did not have her size so we had to order it, we cannot wait to go back when it arrives!  I have a gala in May and I may need to go there for my dress too! Beautiful designer selection. Thank you Vio for making my daughter feel special! Thank you to Violet who made the experience and entire process of finding bridesmaids gowns smooth and possible! She is amazing to work with, efficient and ensures you are always taken care of. Highly recommend working with them! Such a great experience! Ikhlaas was super patient and so helpful! I love my dress and can\u2019t wait to wear it! I just had my first appointment with Priscilla and I am so amazed by how talented she is. She had me in and out within 20 minutes with perfect looking brows. She also does an amazing job of making her customers comfortable. Would highly recommend! Priscilla did a fantastic job with my eyebrows. She was really nice, thoughtful and walked me through the whole process and what she was doing. She clearly loves what she does and is great at it! I changed to this location when the Charles Street one closed. Priscilla is amazing and taught me while she was working on my browser. I found this really helpful so she could give me tips and I can replicate at home. I will be coming back to this location for sure, thank you! First time I visited benefits in downtown area. Priscilla was great. She was very friendly and professional, welcoming ,Her customer services were outstanding. My eyebrows look lovely and she gave me techniques how to make my eyebrows look more thicker. Priscilla did an amazing job on my eyebrows! I\u2019ve been looking for a good spot in Boston and I\u2019ve found it! So kind and helpful and super knowledgeable about everything she does! Looking forward to coming back to Priscilla for my next brow wax! Its a nice store with nice clothes, but poor customer experience and little attention to detail. There was a friends & family sale, so I tried on a beautiful pair of jeans and explicitly asked the saleswoman what the final price would be. She said 201 after f&f discounts (even showed me the number on the screen), but when I was ready to pay the final price was 246 or something like that. I asked about the difference and she said I was mistaken, she had never said 201. I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve been really nice jeans but I cannot trust a brand that underestimates their clients and doesnt care about customer experience. Ari was amazing helping me find the perfect pair of jeans! She was kind, not pushy and genuinely helpful. Hard to find these days. Her co worker Layne was so sweet too. As a business owner, I take extreme pride in customer service and they exceeded in that. Great shopping experience overall, see you guys again soon! Stopped in today and was styled by Ari.  She is a fashion genius! She brought me styles I would never consider that were so flattering. If you need flattering jeans stop in and see Ari! I\u2019ll definitely be back! Ari was awesome! Super helpful in getting me two pairs of jeans that fit. Great store. I love FRAME jeans but the customer service at this shop was above and beyond. I highly recommend this location! Lauren was fantastic! I've had butternut squash soup, beet salad and a lobster sandwich. The soup was very flavorful and had good texture. The salad was equally good--it had nice textures going on and wasn't overdressed. The lobster sandwich wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. Overall, I was pleased with the experience. I'm a big fan. The people are fun and warm As good as it can get! As a local, this place is such a great addition \u2014 even being in the Canopy Hotel! The hotel is beautiful and this restaurant is delish. We come here on and off for meals and today was a great experience. Anna helped us decide what we wanted and was very hospitable and nice! We\u2019re staying here for a few days so can\u2019t wait to come back and experience more of the food and talk to the bartenders! 10/10 recommend! Had a great brunch at this spot inside a hotel. The atmosphere is surprisingly open and inviting. The food exceeded our expectations\u2014beautifully presented and delicious. We ordered the wings, which were crispy, perfectly sauced, and juicy on the inside. Highly recommend! For our entrees, we had a build-your-own omelette, eggs Benedict, and a chicken sandwich\u2014generous portions that left us feeling satisfied. Just a heads up, they serve brunch until 2pm, then reopen for dinner around 4-5pm. It's a trendy, stylish place perfect for a fun outing with friends or a casual date night. This is a great place with food and tapas. It gets full during the rush hours and you see the crowd of local business people standing and getting a drink a food to go. Prices are OK for Boston. Location is perfect, close to the old town and not too far from the Italian district. Wonderful live music, even better service. Chill atmosphere. Anna is very attentive and makes incredible cocktails! Our first time staying in downtown Boston. Will definitely be back! Had a wonderful meal! Love the interior and the location is right by hotspots like the North End and Faneuil Hall. What we ordered: buffalo chicken pizza, meatball parmigiana, cranberry feta salad, short rib shiitake pappardelle (favorite!), wagyu smash burger. Asked for fruity mocktails and those were tasty too. The service from Heather was great! I\u2019m really sad to say the quality has gone down hill here. I\u2019ve gone to Elizabeth Grady for 6 or 7 years and up until a month ago, Elizabeth Grady is the only place I\u2019ve trusted with my brows.  I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever come back. I started going to your financial district location because it\u2019s right around the corner from my work.\n\nI went about a month ago, and I\u2019ve been letting time pass before writing this. I was shown the mirror, and when I noticed a bald spot on my brows, I asked the esthetician. I felt the wax sloppily dripping down my face the entire appointment ! She told me it was a scar! A scar that I don\u2019t have!  If I had a scar I think I would\u2019ve known! So I tried to discuss it with the manager at check out and she was basically like \u201csorry\u201d . To be quite honest with you, her lack of customer service was appalling . I don\u2019t think I will be coming back any time soon. Came in to get my husband some new work shoes. The manager, Christine, is so helpful and enthusiastic. She was extremely knowledgeable and educated me on the different styles. Thanks Christine I will definitely be back Middle-aged brunette lady had an attitude from the moment I walked in and clearly wasn\u2019t interested in helping. As a customer who has bought numerous AE shoes, I won\u2019t be coming back. Worst customer service I\u2019ve ever experienced at Allen Edmonds. She should be fired. Go to another AE location. Great environment, the staff were attentive and helpful without being pushy. Highly recommend stopping by if you\u2019re looking to invest in your first quality pair of leather shoes!\n\nChristine sized my partner and helped him pick out a beautiful pair of Chelsea boots. She gave us care tips for my partner\u2019s most expensive shoe investment thus far and also helped him realized he\u2019d been wearing the wrong shoe size for his entire adult life, haha. We\u2019ll be back for his next pair! Marley was fantastic working with, great service and nice footwear. Excellent experience. I worked with Victor who was very patient and fielded all of my questions around getting the right dress boots to match my suit. I have wider feet so I wasn't sure I'd be able to find anything that would fit but I did and was in and out pretty quickly. Highly recommend stopping by to check out their stock. First time in my life I\u2019ve deliberately been sold two shoes from different pairs!\n\nAt first, I thought it was just a mistake, so I returned to the store to get the correct shoe. But I got told it was no mistake and that's why they were discounted, let me laugh !\n\nThankfully, I noticed they were mismatched before wearing them, so I was able to get a refund and that's why I give 2 stars.\n\nI didn\u2019t even realize it when trying them on because honestly, who would ever expect to be given two different shoes?\n\nWhile your shop looks great, this felt like a scam to get rid of unwanted stock. It wasted my time and really pissed me off. My favorite place to shop in Boston. Wide range of selection with prices ranging for everyone. A place that makes you feel like home. Staff is the best and is super accommodating. This is a must go if you are in Boston Guy behind the counter was annoying and unhelpful, asked about an untagged item and he couldn\u2019t provide any info. When I found the tag for the jacket he stood there and held the tag and wouldn\u2019t leave. After I told him I didn\u2019t need his assistance he proceeded to stand there holding the tag just looking at me. I pulled out my phone to write down the item number and he snapped at me saying I couldn\u2019t write down the item number (can\u2019t take pics but there\u2019s no sign saying you can\u2019t write down item numbers) The staff is extremely helpful and kind . The store is very well stocked with the latest fashions . Alan Bilzerian\u2019s is our first stop when we hit the city. Alan is very accommodating and makes sure you feel welcomed . I bought a shoe from here two months ago and\nthis veja brand shoes opened\nand they said they can't get a refund\nthis is a very sad situation\nfriendly people but their shoes are bad and they don't take returns. Do not shop here because if there is a problem they will not take care of you after the sale. Cool shop - lots of stuff, from apparel to shoes and candles and other stuff.   Not too high end either - sometimes shops like these are unapproachable and this store wasn't at all.  Even the staff was friendly which is not usual in most stores that self-identify as being a cool!  Would go back.  Bought some nice dunks and the prices seemed very reasonable. *Note that I am not talking about the quality of products they sell or about their customer service.\nThis store is one of the few FUN & interesting contemporary interiors in town, serving a true fashionable audience. I had a great time! Best sneaker shop in Boston! Big thank you to AB & DEEMZ! Definitely coming back to see them. Amazing selection of niche skate brands. And of course all the hypebeast staples that you would expect.\nGreat staff, will be back for sure\ud83e\udef6 I thought the curation in the store was pretty nice, they were a lot of pieces I liked which isnt always the case with streetwear shops. They had selections of Marni, rick owens, etc. and some more affordable labels too.  The shoe selection was not bad but they dont have too many sizes or options- pretty hit and miss, but good for browsing.\n\nTook a while to be helped but the staff was at least apologetic about it Will Charles Salon is amazing place to get your hair color and haircut! Everyone is absolutely professional and experienced, staff is the most friendly!\nThank you Bri Klimas for wonderful experience and confident look! Please do yourself a favor and schedule an appointment with Bri Klimas - she is innately a magician with color. I am a natural brunette and have always wanted to look naturally champagne blonde.\n\nI met Bri last fall after I abused Sun-In then had a horrible dye job at another salon that left me looking wildly brassy orange... Bri was fearless and spent 6 hours fixing it and used over 100 foils. She added dimension, toned it, did a treatment - and took her time. She approaches hair like an artist approaches a painting. She is intentional, skilled, listens to you and also provides expert direction (which I need!). She recommends shampoos and products for my hair - and never pressures me to buy anything or do any service.\n\nNo one else will ever do my hair besides Bri! I even plan to bring in my boyfriend to see her :). Will Charles salon is lucky to have Bri as a hair stylist! GO TO BRI!! I have naturally dirty blonde hair and had been getting it highlighted but wanted a smoother balayage that looked more natural. Bri worked her magic and made my hair look ABSOLUTELY stunning. She fixed my hair completely! It blends so well and no damage was done to my hair which is extremely important. Not only was the dye job immaculate but the experience was amazing too. Bri was so accommodating and made sure I was comfortable the entire time. She really takes into account how her clients are feeling and works towards YOUR best interests. I couldn't thank her enough and don't think I could ever go to anyone else to get my hair done. Definitely will be coming back every time I need a touch up. This is one of the best salons I have been to, especially moving from place to place. My stylist Bri is so creative and is a hair genius! She envisions what you want and brings it to life. She also gives her honest opinion on what styles best fits your profile, if you are unsure on what you want. If you are new to the area, just visiting, or looking for a new place to get your hair done, go here! Will Charles salon is amazing! I get my hair cut by Bri and she is hands down the best hairdresser I\u2019ve ever had. Bri pays close attention to detail and listens to all of my wants/needs! I would 100% recommend her and Will Charles salon to anyone looking for quality, flawless hair care! I\u2019ve gotten haircuts from multiple barbers here, and while they\u2019re all great, Zak is the one I keep going back to and would recommend. If you\u2019re trying to find someone who will consistently give you his best work, this is the guy. I went to Barbershop Lounge to get a beard trim / shave from Zak. The atmosphere is laid back with nice music and good conversation. Zak was super friendly and did a nice job with my beard. I would recommend Barbershop Lounge, and Zak specifically, for any shave / haircut needs you may have! Darrin is the Best!\n\nJust got a fantastic haircut from Darrin at Barber Shop Lounge, and I couldn\u2019t be happier! He did an amazing job\u2014very stylish and professional, exactly what I needed for my career in sales where looking sharp is key.\n\nThe entire staff is top-notch, super friendly, welcoming, and professional. You can tell they take pride in their work and care about their clients. The shop itself has a great vibe, and the location on Newbury St. is perfect\u2014I always grab lunch nearby after my cut!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great barber and a top-tier experience, I highly recommend Darrin and the team at Barber Shop Lounge. I\u2019ll definitely be back! \ud83d\udc88\ud83d\udd25 I have been coming to Barbershop Lounge on Newbury Street for years. My son went first and recommended it. Rosa has always been the one to cut my hair. She is THE BEST.  An artist with a scissors and razor, Rosa is a perfectionist who always makes me smile when I leave. Whatever event I have coming up, Rosa always makes me look and feel my best. I hate to say it, but I didn't have a good first experience with Gama. I brought pictures of the haircut I wanted as inspiration but he left me with something thicker and poofier than I wanted. When I prompted him to take my beard line lower, he looked incredulous and talked down on the idea. It wasn't a very collaborative discussion, and he was a bit rough with the comb. Finally, he left the back of my neck raw and inflamed from the shave. I did my hair with Rezi and she was absolutely amazing. She was good. Kind, with patience and the other staff were also friendly and kind BUT\u2026.\nUPDATE:\nTheir products completely ruined my curls. I highlighted my curls 2 and half years ago and my curls were completely okay and very much staying fresh and beautiful. But after I went to this salon my curls are now ruined. I am looking for a place to cut it completely and for some reason do not trust them to go back there.\nMy hair was beautiful for the first week. After the second week I started seeing how horrible my curls have turned out. I don\u2019t know what to do.\nThe salon may be better for those who don\u2019t have curls but for me\u2026not so good. I also tried to reach out and ask for their help and they told me just put some oil and hair cream and my curls would look good. I knew that already !! My curls are ruined!!!!! From Julie Joyal (HMS MEDscience)\nFIVE STARS FOR Lee Combs!  I have been around the block over the years! Up and down Newbury Street and I am very picky! Lee is hands down the best hairstylist I\u2019ve ever been to! Her precision, technique, and her attention to detail are unmatched. It is a dream to have her cut my hair and her blow drys are the best I have ever had. Lee brought my cut to life flawlessly\u2014better than I even imagined! The cut was perfect, stylish, beautiful, and suited me perfectly. Her haircuts grow out perfectly! On top of that, Lee is professional, friendly, and really listens to what you want. If you're looking for the best haircut experience, look no further than Lee Combs. Highly recommend! I am so picky about who I will allow to touch my hair. Sal is absolutely amazing and has been doing my hair for the last few years. I\u2019m so happy I connected with him because my hair has never been healthier, especially after years with extensions. Since I started seeing him, I have literally never gotten so many compliments on my hair. He is more than just a hairdresser, he is a friend that makes you feel and look amazing as well. I can\u2019t recommend him enough. Another reviewer commented the new location is charming and comfortable. In my opinion it is not. The seating area is decorative and extremely uncomfortable. Area in between there and the wash area is like a maze and if you don't look out you will run in to people. Plus the fact multiple visits there I have seen dogs unleashed sitting on furniture. This is so unsanitary, clients need to leave the dogs at home. I greatly preferred and miss the 9 location. It was easier and everything was better including the reason you go for the services. I only went to one person for my color but I had to wait 5 months last time for her. I gave up and decided to see David at the Seaport location. He was fantastic. Now I see he is not on the website for bookings? a loss if he has left the salon I was highly disappointed with my appointment at Salon Mario Russo. It was my first time visiting the salon. I booked online and once the hairdresser saw me in person, she visibly sighed. She washed my hair and then informed me that someone else would have to do my hair because of a booking issue. I was then lead to a very friendly woman who did not speak or understand English. To be transparent I am an African American woman with ethnic hair. It was clear to me that the salon was not trained in the art of styling black women\u2019s natural hair. The whole ordeal was disappointing and this \u201ctop rated\u201d salon should be embarrassed. Take a master class and get with the times people!!! My wife and I couldn't be more pleased with Angel and the team at Boston's Rolex Boutique. Angel was absolutely fantastic and made our first Rolex experience truly unforgettable. He took the time to understand our tastes and interests, thoughtfully showing us a range of timepieces we might enjoy. His patience and attention to detail ensured that we felt confident and satisfied with our decision. After working with Angel to find the perfect match, we left the store with our very first beautiful Rolex watch. We would wholeheartedly recommend this store to anyone in search of an elegant timepiece. The experience was exceptional from start to finish. To the Long's Rolex Boutique,\n\nThank you so much for providing such an incredible experience during my visit to the store and the purchase of my very first Rolex. From start to finish, the entire process was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nA special thank you to Angel, who went above and beyond to help us choose the perfect watch and size for me. Angel's expertise, patience, and genuine enthusiasm made all the difference. When the watch arrived in less than a month, the pickup process was smooth and effortless.\n\nI highly recommend Long's Rolex Boutique and Angel to anyone looking for a remarkable experience and top-notch customer care. Acquiring your first Rolex is more than a purchase\u2014it\u2019s a milestone etched in time, a quiet testament to resilience and triumph. It\u2019s not merely about the watch itself, but the experience that shapes the moment.\n\nIf you have the privilege of stepping into the 8 Newbury Street boutique, seize it. The service there transcends expectation, elevating the act of choosing a Rolex into a memory to be treasured. I had the distinct honor of meeting Michael S., the boutique director, whose warmth and expertise transformed the experience into something truly extraordinary. His thoughtful guidance through different models and sizes reflected not just professionalism, but a genuine passion for the craft.\n\nNow, as I fasten my new timepiece around my wrist, I feel the weight of accomplishment and legacy. This Rolex is not just a symbol of success\u2014it\u2019s a piece of my story, one I\u2019ll wear with pride and pass down through generations. To Peggy and the Long\u2019s Jewelers team, Thank You! I have been dreaming about owning a Sea Dweller and Peggy made that dream come true. This is my first Rolex and Peggy made the experience truly memorable by going above and beyond. The boutique is exquisite and all of the staff were very friendly. I highly recommend Long\u2019s and will be back again. I visited Long\u2019s shortly after moving to Boston this summer, and Marc made the experience fantastic. He was very welcoming, honest and walked me through the entire process of getting my Air King serviced. He took the time to answer all my questions about the servicing process and even let me try on models I was interested in.\n\nLong\u2019s handled my watch service by sending it to their service center in Pennsylvania, and they did an outstanding job. Certainly a great experience\u2014I highly recommend Long\u2019s and Marc for their professionalism and transparency. Robin is incredibly knowledgeable and skilled in beauty! Her skincare line has left me glowing and feeling so confident in my skin. JP also does phenomenal lash extensions with such attention to detail. Both of them create such a welcoming space in the cutest salon on Newbury St! Robin is so great at solving any skin problem, I love how she customizes her facials to whatever she feels that you need. If Robin started a cult I would definitely join!! Robin did a great job with my acne. My face has gotten better. My face is starting to get flawless. I have been having bad acne since high school. Most acne is gone after a few treatments with exfoliation. This was my first time here using a Groupon for a Brazilian Wax. I usually do not write reviews but I feel compelled to share my experience here.\n\nThe space is nice & aesthetic. I was greeted upon arrival.\n\nRobin started educating me about her process and materials, which I applaud, yet after reflecting on my experience, I question the validity of it.\n\nWe talked a bit while she set up her station. Upon the small talk, we discussed my Puerto Rican heritage & I discovered she is an ignorant white woman with poor listening skills. It did not feel like a welcoming space to POC.\n\nAnyways, I was nervous as I\u2019ve only ever received this service once before elsewhere & I knew how painful it could be. I warned her about my experience and she persisted that it would be better. It was not.\n\nI knew it was going to hurt and the pain I felt is not why I am giving it one star, but more so how my pain was handled.\n\nRobin invalidated my reaction to the pain I experienced and gaslit me by saying \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt that bad. I think you are just scared because you aren\u2019t in control.\u201d and when I told her, advocating to myself while in tears \u201cNo. It just hurts.\u201d She proceeded to laugh and said this was the worst she has seen in 20 years, still insisting that I was overreacting with multiple condescending comments after that.\n\nObviously, this did not make me feel better. I felt dehumanized and unseen. It was a terrible feeling not only physically, but emotionally. Also, the room she did the waxing in had windows with the curtains open and the view faced other office windows so it made me uncomfortable and exposed.\n\nThe overall end result was good. She did a good job getting majority of the hair, but her as a person & her interpersonal skills were not good at all.\n\nI do want to continue getting brazilian waxes but I will NOT be coming back to Robin or recommending it to others. Been going to Robin for my lashes for honestly about 4-5 years now and I can\u2019t live without them! Robin is great and I am constantly getting compliments on my lashes! She is always able to work around my crazy schedule as well which is a huge benefit! Just purchased a topper from The Salon 10 Newbury. My daughter had previously purchased a topper which looks great, so I went for my thin hair. Love my new topper! The entire staff made this the best experience! Respected my concerns and taught me well on care of my topper. The owner and staff are true professionals. I highly recomend this salon to every gender looking to feel great and look great!  April 2025. My experience at The Salon at 10 Newbury St exceeded my expectations. Anyone experiencing hair loss understands the emotions that come with it. The staff understands and offers such respect.I  had a gorgeous hair topper created made for me with gorgeous hair, reflecting my own natural hair texture and style. It needed alteration, styling and several visits. Jamie exhibited such talent and patience which was so appreciated. Pat, the owner is an absolute rock star. She is kind beyond words and a true saint for many! When I walked into the Salon at 10 Newbury, I was sobbing (not a person who cried much before my cancer, but I was in shock and devastated). I loved my natural blonde mermaid hair. I didn't want to change anything about it. My shag fit my face perfectly. But I didn't have a choice. My cancer was Stage IIIC, and I needed to complete a high dose difficult chemo program that was not amenable to cold capping. 1.5 weeks in, my hair started falling out. One day in strands, soon after in clumps. Before that happened, I went to the salon. Pat talked with me about wigs, gave me tissues when I cried, showed me a few options. The stylist, Jamie spoke so kindly to me and my partner. He measured my hair, asked me questions about it, studied it closely. I wasn't ready to shave my head so he gave me a bob, told me to come back when I was ready and that he'd work on the wig in the meantime. When I came back, they put the wig on me, and I pointed out every little detail that I didn't like. Most people probably would have thought it looked great. Most salons probably would have said they did their best. They resewed the wig by hand to make a tiny change to the shape, made a very slight alteration to the color, adjusted the cut by millimeters  When he shaved my head, me fully in tears, he didn't look at me with discomfort. He handed me tissues. He checked in. He gave me a moment. When he put the wig on me the next time, I cried some more, but this time tears of relief. I thanked Jamie for helping me feel beautiful again. I wore my wig regularly. When people who knew me saw me with the wig on, they couldn't tell it wasn't my hair. They told me how good it looked. I went back one more time for a slight trim to the bangs, and every time, Jamie was happy to help. He wanted me to have the best wig, to be satisfied. I didn't want to let go of my hair, but I felt lucky to work with such a compassionate stylist who did such beautiful work. Here are two pics of me in the wig. 10/10 - We had the absolute best experience at this salon choosing a wig for a friend going through cancer treatment. Start to finish they made us feel comfortable, gave us plenty of time and space  to make the right choice and incredibly thorough instruction on care and maintenance of the piece. Highly highly recommend for anyone seeking assistance choosing a natural looking wig for long term wear! Jamie helped my partner get the best possible fit for her wig while she underwent chemo and radiation cancer treatments. He also styled it perfectly. Very kind and patient staff who also have the necessary expertise and skills. Best bed I\u2019ve ever had. I am ruined/spoiled after eight years on a dux, and hotel-sleeping is now uncomfortable.\nNever an issue or a bad nights sleep on my dux. Dux makes the best beds I have ever experienced, and I am delighted to be purchasing my second Dux bed. Their service is great, the store manager is great. I heartily recommend! The staff was really friendly and knowledgeable about the brand. She offered professional recommendations matched my preferences perfectly. The store has a great selection of collections. Highly recommend to visit the store on a weekday, the cozy and quite atmosphere is perfect for browsing Such a great experience with Matt today.\nPerfect representative of the brand. Couldn\u2019t be happier!\nThank you! As always le labo store was neat and service was great . The staff on the store was knowledgeable and helped us figure out what we wanted. Great perfumes. Poorly run store. Don't trust the store hours.  Hate to leave a 1-star review, but they have been closed 3 times that I've tried to visit during regular hours in the past 2 weeks. I even called to confirm they would be open this time, showed up, and they're closed.  Maybe the other location is better? Who doesn't like a cute little shop on Newbury St? The product speaks for itself. Loved seeing them hand craft my order in front of me. I'm a Chemist, so iykyk I was very excited to see it!\nWill be returning! I typically love frequenting this Tiffany\u2019s, as it\u2019s the closest to me location wise. My family has purchased numerous Tiffany\u2019s pieces and I often drop off my pieces here to get cleaned. Usually my experience is amazing, and the sales representatives are kind, attentive, and friendly. Today I had the most negative experience picking up a couple of my pieces. We waited almost half an hour to be helped. The young man at the front was kindly checking in on us and letting us know the next sales rep would help once she was done with another customer. Once we finally were helped, she brought the pieces out, had me sign and handed me a Tiffany dust bag and gestured to me to pack up the items and we were set. I was picking up two rings and a bracelet and was only given one bag so the pieces would be bumping up against each other until I get home. The previous time when I picked up my pieces. the male sales rep asked me to check every piece to ensure I was happy with the cleaning, packed each piece up for me and put it in a bag for me. That\u2019s the level of service that has made me a fan of Tiffany\u2019s and continue grow my collection. However this experience today with the sales rep has really soured my experience with Tiffany\u2019s. I wish I caught the sales rep name but she is tall with straight black hair and was wearing a Valentino belt. I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to Angel, whose exceptional assistance facilitated my discovery of the coveted 'narrow ring' from Tiffany & Co.'s esteemed T collection. Following a delightful serendipity, Angel presented me with the T1 ring, which I found equally captivating. My enthusiasm led me to make an impulsive yet delightful decision: acquiring not one, but two exquisite pieces. While my husband's reaction was somewhat reserved, I was thoroughly enthralled with my purchases. I received a ring from Tiffany for a gift. It was beautiful, but unfortunately not the right size. I brought it back to the store to exchange it, but the gemstone in the ring in my size at the store was dull and had basically no color to it compared to what I was returning, even though it was the exact same ring. The saleswomen, who was very professional and accommodating, suggested ordering from the wear house to try and get a ring that is brighter and truer to the original ring I received, and the picture that Tiffany posts online advertising this product.\n\nI received my replacement ring from the warehouse today, and frankly it is hideously ugly and looks like costume jewelry. To say I am disappointed in the quality is an understatement. The stone looks like the same exact color as the setting. I called and spoke to someone else who was also very nice, but their only suggestion was to try going to different stores to see them in person, and it just doesn\u2019t seem worth the hassle. I will be returning and no longer have faith in Tiffany to provide a quality product My partner and I had a great experience. We're younger and I saw a lot of people saying they felt judged, but Albert gave us an amazing experience. We told him our price range (which for Tiffany people was low) but he didn't care. Gave us exactly what we wanted and was also super interesting to talk to. We love you Albert! I went to the Tiffany store in the Copley mall to purchase a Smile necklace. The salesman (John) who helped me was great, he was very friendly and very patient in showing me the different colors and letting me try it. However, while we were in the process of him assisting me with the different necklaces to try on, there were 2 associates standing very close to us (they looked like assistants rather than salesperson) that kept snickering and laughing right beside me. It wasn't clear to me what was funny or whether they were laughing at something I said, the salesman or something else but they left me feeling very uncomfortable. I would think a high-end brand like Tiffany would hire more professional people so that was quite a disappointing experience. I ended up making my purchase and John, again was very nice throughout the entire process but this isn't a store I would want to step in again if the standard is so low for certain employees. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. Incredible store, clothing, and customer experience! Sarah always goes above and beyond to help you find your ideal clothing, and she is so kind! It\u2019s a stunning store and every employee is a joy to talk with. They also host phenomenal events to benefit local businesses & charities. Sarah is fantastic! I returned something in-store purchased online a few weeks ago and she was warm and welcoming. This was my first time in this particular store. She helped me find other suitable options\u2026. I came back over a month later with another return and Sarah was there and knew me by name and immediately helped with my return and selecting alternative options. Love VB love this store! Store is ran as beautifully as the clothes itself. The absolute kindest and efficient managers and sales team. Costumer service was impeccable. Thank you to Sarah and Reegan!! This store has the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE\nThe Regional Mgr Lauren Reader happened to be in the store, made me a fantastic offer then disappeared. The sales associate Sarah was snarky and totally useless\nGo to Neiman\u2019s or Nordstrom they carry VB, and they stand behind the quality of their products Walked in with my sister because she loves this store. Granted we are coming straight from the airport, so we aren\u2019t dressed our best but the girl working said hi to everyone but us. I would like to think it wasn\u2019t due to us being Hispanic but that was the only obvious difference other than her probably thinking we didn\u2019t have money to spend. Would rather shop online. Save four self a trip to this store. Oksana is an eyebrow wizard!!! Boston\u2019s best eyebrow shaper. I would never trust anyone else. She\u2019s so precise, and never takes off too much. The best massages during facials that you can imagine.  Not to mention she\u2019s a wonderful person! Never had my hair done here, so this review is for waxing. Oksana is efficient and professional, and I have yet to find anyone else who can match her skill. Seriously, shell out the $25 for a really excellent brow wax and I promise you won\u2019t regret it. I find the salon to be extremely unprofessional when it comes to booking and keeping appointments. I would not recommend this salon. I've been Oksana\u2019s client for several years. She is incredibly talented, precise in her work, and kind. I would highly recommend her to anyone! I have been getting my hair cut/color at Salon Pini for the past 15 years! Yes 15 years, Loredana has always made me happy after each visit. I drive about an hour each way but I some how get home faster because I'm happier on the way home. thanks Loredana and Salon Pini :-))))) At this store, an employee can help you scan your feet to determine your shoe size, width, and arch type. These things will help determine the type of shoe best suited for you. The staff tend to be busy running around getting shoes for all of the guests, but if you have an hour or so to spend here and patience, it is well worth the experience. The staff are knowledgeable about a variety of foot needs and will make the shopping experience easier and your feet happier. The worst customer service, which will ruin the Brand. We came in the store for a while and no staff took care of us at all, which was fine as they maybe too busy. Then my wife tried on a pair of display shoes by ourselves, and one staff , called KJ, jump to us and blamed us for trying display shoes, and \u2018educated us\u2019 of their store rules. He also pointed out how customers feel if they purchased a pair of shoes that was tried on by other customers. It is very interesting, and I am curious if new balance sell customer display shoes or all their stock shoes were never be tried on? You are not only showed us how unprofessional yourself, but also  how bad of new balance evaluate their salesman. I highly recommend the new balance flagstore though. Thank you for ruin my day, and good luck for your career. If I could give this place a million negative stars I would. I never leave reviews however, I felt the need to here. The young man trying to wait on people was as rude as they come. I asked about a certain shoe and he said nothing on that wall will fit you. Wait don\u2019t you need to know what size shoe I wear? Then I asked for another shoe is a certain size and he had the nerve to rudely ask is that the size you are wearing now? I think I know what size I want. I would never give this shop my business and will be calling in a complaint to corporate. This man lost you a lot of money that day because it was packed in there and everyone walked out because of him. Horrible customer service. I am a manager for a company that prides itself on customer service and this stores employees made me realize how much bad employees can effect a business. The staff member who assisted me was hostile and obviously didn\u2019t care. He brought me out the completely wrong shoe in the wrong size and just dropped them in front of me and walked off. He was extremely rude when I asked for help. So I decided to go to another store where the employees were friendly and helpful. I witnessed the employee doing this to every customer. Never coming here again or recommending it. Staff was impolite and offensive. Came in at 5:40 knowing that they were closing for the day at 6pm, and needed to choose a pair of running shoes along with shorts and a jersey. They were unwilling to help and rushing me out. Even one of the members said: \u201cyou have two minutes\u2026\u201d, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was set to spend 200+ on my running gear and was totally discouraged to make my purchase. Walked out the door and took my business elsewhere. Outraged. This is an amazing place for brunch and dinner. I was there for brunch and the food was tasted amazing! I loved my Eggs Benedict. I also had a drink called Bellini. This place has a nice location, you can make a reservation online or call them. I never had a problem being seated. Customer service is good, everyone is so friendly and nice.\n\nI have been there for dinner. The dinner menu is good. I tried their Lamb meatballs. It has a great combination of meatballs, hummus, and pita. I ordered an Espresso martini and it was perfect. The barman is a nice guy who always suggests you drink something cool depending on what you like. He did a great job on my boyfriend's drink. We both were satisfied with his job.\n\nThe place by itself is big and it has a cool design.\nI love this place and I will be back for sure. This place should be absolutely packed, but on a mid week afternoon, it was almost empty.  My wife and I arrived, and we sat down, at a table that was absolutely covered in food crumbs from a previous customer.  There were no less than 4 young ladies standing right where we sat down,  who all promptly ignored us. I asked one of the girls for a rag, so I could wipe our table,  and she looked at me blankly. I had to repeat myself three times. Finally, one of the other girls went over and wiped down the table. Service is not their strong suit for the Deli. We ordered, and waited about twenty minutes for two sandwiches. Thankfully, they were quite tasty and well made. Again, with the quality of the products, and food they put out, this place should be packed every day. They also have an adjoining dinner location that looked quite well decorated. Would I  go back, yes, but with lower expectations.... we had gone there based on very good reviews...... This place is popular among locals public. By the time we arrived the place was packed. But since we had a reservation they were able to set us right away.  We were served with some deep-fried pasta with truffle salt and cut sausages. Our group of five ordered a lot of appetizers and everything that we ordered was tasty. Our service was fast and pleasant. Food is good, however value leaves something to be desired.\n\nBefore you call me out for taking issue with the restaurant please know that the manager came by on her rounds to make sure people were satisfied with the product. I told her everything I am going to write here. She was polite, gave me some information I didn't have, and thanked me for my input. So she is a 5/5. Forgot to ask her name, sorry.\n\nDelicatessen is not a word I would use to describe this counter service sandwich shop. You cannot buy meats by the pound or portion thereof, potato salad and coleslaw were only available in single serving sizes, and they only have sweet bread and butter pickles. Delicatessen this place is not.\n\nCraft meats is true, daily made truffle chips is true, meat (and cheese) sandwiches is true so provisions is a much better description.\n\nNormally when you order a sandwich for $13 it comes with - chips, fries, coleslaw - something. Not here. Here you get a sandwich that is maybe $9 worth of food. The sandwich is good, but for the price they need to give you something more - more filling, a side, maybe actual glassware for when you dine in - something.\n\nI did find out that they make their own meats in house. While the manager was less than fully informed on prosciutto's curing process, her point of craft meat over commercial meat was taken into consideration when considering value.\n\nI won't choose to eat here a second time. Having Italian meats for Italian sandwiches, a better value for the goods they are offering, and not using single use plastic for in restaurant dining would go a long way to changing my mind. Awesome place for sandwiches for lunch and breakfast as well. The staff wasn't as engaging in services. Sandwiches were good and tasty with fresh ingredients and deli meat that wasn't to salty but just right. The truffle chips were worth the extra price. The pulled pork sandwich was more lightly flavored with seasonings and a bit messy. Would definitely recommend take out for lunch! My experience with Gembox was amazing. They were able to get me a sold out Messika ring I had on my wishlist. The shop is beautiful and they are so easy to work with. We love Brilliant Earth! We went in this past weekend to look at wedding rings, after we purchased my engagement ring here about 2 years prior, and met with Bridget. She was knowledgable, kind, and personable. Everyone in the office has been welcoming and genuine both times we've visited! Bridget easily guided us through the different options without being too pushy. We quickly landed on the rings we wanted, and she made the purchasing process quick and easy! My engagement ring is great quality - it looks just as beautiful today as the day I received it! We can't wait to receive our wedding bands and can't thank Brilliant Earth enough for their role in our story! My fianc\u00e9 and I went to Brilliant Earth for our wedding bands. We had a wonderful experience working with Mandi! She was very knowledgeable, helpful, and made us feel comfortable when looking at a variety of bands. We are very happy with our choices. Highly recommend booking an appointment with her! We worked with Aij Jardim to find wedding bands that went with my Brilliant Earth engagement ring. Aij really listened to us and showed us a variety of different options. We went in thinking we wanted very specific bands but as we tried in different options and  looked around we discovered the exact bands we wanted. Aij showed us options in a variety of price points but we really felt like rather than being pushed to the largest or flashiest ring, Aij looked alongside with us and helped us determine which bands were best for the aesthetic we were looking for. We had a wonderful experience and recommend Brilliant Earth to all of our friends and family! If you go to Newbury Street, work with Aij, she was fantastic! We worked with sales associate Abby who made it such a great experience. She was friendly, engaging and it felt like she was truly invested in helping us find the rings we love. She explained the processes clearly and followed up with a detailed summary of our visit. I am so glad we had this session! I am incredibly disappointed with the quality of the engagement ring my husband purchased from Brilliant Earth. About seven months after we got engaged, the band developed a strange purple tinge. When we reached out to customer service, they initially blamed me, claiming I must have damaged the ring while blow-drying my hair\u2014a ridiculous assertion as I take it off when doing just about anything. I've worn gold jewelry my entire life without any issues, including a ring I\u2019ve had since I was five years old that now fits my pinky.\n\nEventually, they agreed to fix the band, but now, not long after getting it back, the band has *snapped in half* at the back. I am meticulous with my jewelry\u2014I don\u2019t wear my rings when showering, washing my hands, doing my hair and makeup, working out, cleaning, at the beach, in the pool, washing my face, and even going to sleep. Yet this ring, which holds such sentimental value, has been nothing but a disappointment. For a company that claims to offer high-quality, ethical jewelry, the quality has been severely lacking.\n\nI would not recommend brilliant earth, and I will never be purchasing from them again. Overall it was a nice experience. There were not too many people in Stephanie's the day we visited, but the food might have taken a bit longer than expected to be served. I orderd a Tuna Tartare and a Ceasar salad, my friend ordered some fish and chips, the meal was fulfilling. The portion is good for the price, and the atmosphere is also cozy on a cold day. Great place for brunch. Food was great and service was super friendly. Our server, I don\u2019t remember her name \ud83e\udee3, but she was super friendly and funny. The country Greek salad was really good, the portion size is large! It was very fresh and a good option if you want something that will make you feel light afterwards. The tuna tartare was really good too and the chips it comes with were super crunchy and delicious to pair it up. Thanks for everything. Food is AMAZING! For the price you pay for the items on the menu is completely worth it. I feel everywhere else in Boston is overcharged for what you are getting.\n\nVery disappointed that the banana bread with the raspberry and PB is no longer on the menu\u2026 it was DELICIOUS! Had a great brunch outside recently and it was flawless. Great vibes, great food, amazing service.\n\nWould highly recommend. Food is top notch, great quality, with amazing portion sizes.\n\nIt's in the heart of Newbury in the best location and very easy to get to (very walkable).\n\nDefinitely make a reservation, too. It can get pretty busy given how popular Newbury is. Stephanie\u2019s on Newbury is a wonderful spot for casual yet upscale dining, offering classic American comfort food with a twist. It has a cozy and stylish atmosphere, perfect for brunch, lunch, or dinner. Their menu is diverse. The outdoor seating is a great option during warmer months, allowing you to enjoy the lively Newbury Street vibe. It\u2019s an excellent place for both locals and visitors to relax and enjoy a good meal in the heart of Boston. Big fan of the clothing but the quality and durability is a joke for what you pay for. Good style but cheaply made The two guys working there were really helpful! I had spent almost 45 minutes walking down Newbury St trying to find just a basic, black, SnapBack, hat. And either none of the stores had one or they were over $100+.\n\nI walked into Outerknown right before they closed ready to give up on my hat journey but somehow, some way they psychically knew EXACTLY what I was looking for. He handed me the  hat and it was a very reasonable price at $30. They were so attentive and super nice! So grateful to finally have a basic black SnapBack again. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude29 Customer service is excellent, and they stand by their commitment to sustainable, durable clothes. While expensive, you\u2019re getting what you are paying for, especially with their warranty on denim The staff here is incredible!  Max, Chantelle (?) and Val were so friendly and willing to challenge me to try on new & different things.  The blanket shirts are amazing and there were many wrapped under my tree this year for Christmas!  The store is beautiful! I have to agree with what another reviewer noted:  I like the brand and their products, but they have no concept of customer service.  You simply cannot reach this Boston location by phone. It goes into voicemail automatically and no one ever gets back to you. Worse yet, if you try to contact their national customer service department, there is no such department! You simply have to email them and wait for someone to get back with you. I\u2019ve never experienced a clothing brand lacking the ability to reach a live body either at their local store or by way of national customer service.department. Pathetic. I had a very positive experience working with Ikhlaus at L\u2019elite Boutique this past Saturday. She was very professional, knowledgeable, patient and listened to my preferences while suggesting a few of her own. Her professionalism and attention to detail were excellent and she provided honest feedback when I asked her opinion. I would highly recommend Ikhlaus; she is absolutely lovely. I went into L'elite Occasions with my daughter who needed a winter cotillion party dress.  We met Violette and she so incredibly patient while my daughter found the right dress. They did not have her size so we had to order it, we cannot wait to go back when it arrives!  I have a gala in May and I may need to go there for my dress too! Beautiful designer selection. Thank you Vio for making my daughter feel special! Thank you to Violet who made the experience and entire process of finding bridesmaids gowns smooth and possible! She is amazing to work with, efficient and ensures you are always taken care of. Highly recommend working with them! Such a great experience! Ikhlaas was super patient and so helpful! I love my dress and can\u2019t wait to wear it! Just found out about the Google Store today and I went there with my Google Pixel 7. The Google product I want to get the most would have to be the Google Nest security camera. For $15 a month you can have 60 days of video which is really useful and I am going to get one for my mom. I looked at the other Google Pixels my question is why they are trying to look like an iPhone. I like plastic casings on cell phones I have had in the past. The Google Pixel 9 s fold in half. I don't have much use for a tablet maybe for drawing. Chris is super helpful at finding out product information and used Gemini to ask about GPS tags to locate dogs. The current locator tags have a range of 300 feet unless uses a network of tags within range to find if beyond 300 from the Android. I also found out what the Google Home app is for. I like the circular shape of Google watches compared to Apple \ud83c\udf4f watches. A friend of mine stopped by the store last year and told me how great it was so I knew I had to see it for myself. The team working here are super friendly and even when I told them I wasn't planning on buying anything but just wanted to talk shop they were all ears. Very cool store and love the nature/earthy themes. Surprised to find this Google Store.  I have mostly Apple devices and have spent time in an Apple Store, so I was intrigued.  It felt a bit similar to an Apple Store, but not nearly as expansive, or impressively designed.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  I ended up buying a couple of promo apparel items; cap and socks.  They will make nice gifts for other family members. I came upon the store by chance, I had no idea it was there \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f It was very active in the store all the phone agents were busy with customers\ud83d\udcf1\nI was unexpectedly approached by this guy who politely asked me if I needed help. In speaking with him I found out that it was Google's 27 Anniversary today. They were giving out these tasteful cookies \ud83c\udf6a \ud83d\ude0b Talking more with Wilson I found he was working floor security. I told him that he should do both since he was so informative. He could B like a Phone Agent\ud83d\udcf1& Store Security\ud83d\udc6e\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f being since he was so good \u263a\ufe0f\nI really did like the look of the store\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe Margo helped me pick out the most perfect purple \ud83d\udc9c Pixel phone and purple phone case! She helped me transition my old phone and also helped me with organizing my apps. Super knowledgeable with great friendly customer service! She was very patient with all my questions.\nShe made upgrading very easy for me.\nThank you! Great store. People are friendly and helpful but there is one or two employees who don\u2019t have manners or even a hello at the register. Today I said thank you the checkout person. Not even a you\u2019re welcome. Some young people should have a little more manners if they are to interact with the public. Management please speak to them. I hadn't been to Boston for a while so this store was a welcome surprise.\nIt's so much bigger and better stocked than the store on Newbury street. The newest TJs in Boston does a good job of being big and spacious. They also have alcohol in this one whereas the other location aka \u201cthe smallest TJs on the planet\u201d does not. The artwork is what I\u2019ve loved about Trader Joe\u2019s and this location doesn\u2019t miss! Finding the entrance was a bit hard at first. It\u2019s just before the light at Berkeley St on the right hand side. Across the street from Nordstrom Rack on Boylston St. and right next door to Wayfair. It is very huge and spacious but for those of us with a car, you\u2019re forced to park on the street (metered parking) and might not necessarily be closeby. So that\u2019s a challenge bc you can\u2019t take shopping carts to your car. Not worth coming here because of the parking issue, made more for those who are just walking. But still a much better alternative than the very small TJ closer to Mass Avs. Dear Trader Joe\u2019s,\n\nI want to start by saying I absolutely love your store and am a loyal customer. However, I have to express my frustration with your Organic Caesar Salad Kit. While I appreciate the convenience of the product, I\u2019ve noticed a recurring issue: nearly half the bag is filled with the hard, white parts of the lettuce\u2014the kind most people don\u2019t eat unless they\u2019re a rabbit.\n\nEvery time I buy this kit, I end up having to throw a significant portion away, which feels wasteful and unfair, especially for a product marketed as organic and premium. As someone who values quality, I expect better.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll consider addressing the quality control for this product or perhaps even reevaluating whether it belongs on your shelves. I know Trader Joe\u2019s is known for its commitment to excellence, and I\u2019d love to see that reflected in this salad kit.\n\nThank you for listening, and I look forward to seeing improvements!\n\nSincerely,\nAngelo Abysmal Service, Dreadful Quality\n\nI've never felt compelled to write a review or complain about any business before, but this one truly deserves it. Absolutely atrocious! I handed over my $1000 jacket for them to shorten the sleeves, believing they could handle it. The first time, they quoted me around $70, then suddenly it jumped to $90, and finally they had the nerve to charge me $98. Despite that, I still hoped for a decent outcome.\n\nAfter 10 days, they returned my jacket with damaged seams! I complained, and five days later, I got a replacement jacket. But guess what? When I got home and inspected it, the stitching was abysmal\u2014completely different from the original, and poorly done. Furious, I sent them an email, and their response was, \"The seams on the inside are not seen.\"\n\nAre you kidding me? They think it's acceptable to deceive customers just because the inside seams aren't visible?! I made the grave mistake of trusting this business and ended up sacrificing my $1000 jacket. Never again! They do great work, but it's a bit expensive.\n\nI had a pair of selvedge jeans hemmed with a chain stitch. As far as I know, this might be the only place in Boston that has the right sewing machine to be able to do this. The hem was gorgeously done, perfect length, and clean stitches.\n\nDespite what it says online, it currently costs $60 for a chain stitch hem. For that price, it's cheaper to send your pants to a place in NYC and get them chain-stitch hemmed there. I won't go into details, but there's a few online services where you can mail in your jeans and get them hemmed for around $30. But if you want to go to a tailor in-person, I believe this is the only option in Boston. I never write reviews, and I hate to complain about people's business, but I feel compelled to share because this was such a terrible experience I'd hate for you to have a similar one.\n\nWhen I picked up my clothing, not only did they try to give me 3 of my items back even though they had not been altered at all, but they messed up a few things. Carlos agreed and apologized asking me to come back in a few days so they could fix the items for free. When I went back, I was shocked to see they didn't fix the things, but made them worse.\n\nThey put a button in the wrong spot on the pants and used some random button with white font on it instead of something discreet. They took the zipper out of the other pair, but then didn't close the top properly - instead threds are loose and if you pull one, the stitches unravel. The bathing suit was even worse - not only did they make the cup fabric ripple, but they reattached the straps in two different ways so now the cup flares out and is not stable (harder to show in pics but it's unwearable now). Carlos and the front staff agreed the work was low quality and said a manager would call to refund me.\n\nI spoke with the manager Sonya today and asked for my money back for those 3 items. At first she seemed nice, but quickly she began to argue with me about a refund. She told me she's going through personal things and that she has \"more important issues to deal with than this\" and hung up on me.\n\nThen she called me back and agreed to refund some of the items, but upon sending me the receipt, I saw that they charged me to \"fix\" the items that they messed up!!\n\nFor example, to remove the zipper and stitch up the pants was supposed to be $38 total, but then they secretly added an additional $18 to \"close the pants at the top.\" In fact, Carlos confirmed there would be no additional charges because they messed them up. So instead of refunding me in full, Sonya only gave me the $18 back and said the $38 was because they removed the zipper \"even though we did not close the pants at the top.\" What kind of alteration business would ever dream of charging you for pants that they never finished?? Moreover, this was the second mistake - the first was they didn't alter them the first time around.\n\nI told Sonya that this is bad business and that I wanted to talk with Carlos because I know he'd vouch for me about the pants, but she said \"thanks for telling me about business; then go somewhere else\" and hung up on me again and stopped answering the phone.\n\nWhen I looked through the receipt closer, the amount charged does not correspond with what I was told in person for some of the items - for example, $35.78 for darting the bust of a blouse - I was told that would be $15/20 max, but because I had so many items, I just agreed to the full price and they never gave me a breakdown in writing so I didn't see they were upcharging me. That's my own fault.\n\nBottom line, the work is low quality, the manager was incredibly unprofessional and rude, they lie about how much they're charging you, and if they mess something up, they screw you over and don't do a good job fixing it. Even with personal things on her mind which I normally would have grace for, I've never had a manager be so unprofessional and unkind. I used to go to Newbury Tailoring when it was on Newbury St and they were excellent, but unfortunately their quality has dropped and they've become very unprofessional. Learn from my mistake and take your clothes elsewhere. 0/5 stars (if I could give negative, I would).\n\nThe absolute worst of the worst. I visited this establishment in 2018 and left utterly disappointed.\n\nFrom the start, the experience was unacceptable. The person taking my measurements made me extremely uncomfortable, running his hands around my legs, squeezing my calf, and even \u201cmassaging\u201d my inner thighs\u2014all under the guise of a simple hem job.\n\nTo make matters worse, he completely botched my Brunello pants. The tailoring was atrocious. When I brought up the issue, the customer service was not only dismissive but outright rude, shifting the blame onto me. They attempted to gaslight me into believing that suit pants are meant to be tapered so tightly and unevenly. Even as I pointed out the obvious flaws, they continued insisting the fit was \u201cperfect,\u201d rolling their eyes in condescension.\n\nFrustrated and out of options, I left with the damaged pants and never looked back. It took another skilled tailor\u2014and a hefty price\u2014to correct their disaster.\n\nTL;DR\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs. Unless, of course, you enjoy being overcharged for incompetence, insulted for daring to expect quality, and leaving with pants that look like they were tailored by a blindfolded apprentice on their first day. NO ONE COME HERE!!! Complete rip offf !!!! I wasted $107.00 ($40) storage feee ** explain that later \u2026 but Yes HORRIBLE TAILORING PLACE PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID .. I went here because I was recommended by Joseph French cleaners ( Love them ) he told me she can fix my Moncler Jacket \u2026I had a tear on the zipper to get stiched as well as the jacket pocket stitching \u2026 the side pocket NEVER GOT fixed an this women told me I have to pay $40 for a storage fee of my coat after 30 days of not picking up but did not mention Anything about it before HAND .SONIA IS A HORRIBLE HORRIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES . I paid $67 FOR ONE STITCHING an not fix the other pocket DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY We went to the store and were treated poorly from the start. Staff were unhelpful when we asked for assistance with sizes or trying items on, and their attitude felt dismissive and uninterested. Even after we made a significant purchase, we were still not treated with basic courtesy. The overall experience was disappointing and made us feel unwelcome! Was in Boston this weekend visiting my son at BC and went to Alo on Newbury street shopping with his girlfriend and her mother. Lately wherever I go it seems the world has lost the meaning of customer service BUT the customer service in this store was exceptional, from the GM Jake, who was on the sales floor helping customers to his staff who were friendly, eager to help and had great personalities to go with it. Definitely will be back to visit them and shop there. This store is absolutely stunning! And very professionally managed. Alo is one of those companies where you pay for quality. Their clothing is so soft/comfortable and their colors are so unique.\n\nThis store in particular has very kind employees. I don't normally ask for help but they were very knowledgeable and helpful.\n\nI ended up meeting one of the workers, Jake, who I believe is a manager - he was the best! He really cares about the brand and has so much energy that really exudes the vibe of the store.\n\nDefinitely stop here and shop! I love Alo, but I have to say that I LOVE this store! I really enjoy that it's not in an enclosed mall so you get sunlight and fresh air while you shop. \ud83d\ude0c\n\nThe store has this light and airy feel and everyone that I spoke to was so friendly and helpful. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a smile and everyone seemed to work well together to help me pick everything out. It was a good mix of doing my own thing when I wanted but also getting help from the experts when I needed it. \ud83e\uddd9\n(I'm adding the wizard emoji because they really worked their magic and gained a loyal customer)\n\nNot to mention, the aesthetic is on point - everything was thoughtfully arranged and easily accessible, even though it seemed like a busy day with lots of people coming in and out. It's visually appealing and, as someone who works in retail, I can appreciate the effort put into not only making the store look great but keep it that way throughout the day. Their shoe wall drew me in and I went with classic white. They are SO comfortable! \ud83d\udc5f\n\nAs a bonus, their playlist is right up my alley! It's feel-good music that has great energy and I really enjoyed the vibe in there. I love house music, so that might be why it resonated with me lol. \ud83c\udfe0 \ud83c\udfb6\n\nI'm typically an online shopper, and I don't live nearby, but I will make another trip to this store for sure. Can't wait for new colors to drop! \ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\udd25 Needed a new pair of workout pants so I stopped in on a slow day to try out a pair. Not a single staff member greeted me or offered me help, overall had a very holier-than-thou attitude. While I was searching for the fitting rooms, one staff member managed to notice, but yelled across the store at me that they were around the corner. Overall experience was very demeaning, which is sad considering when I browsed at the Seaport location, the sales staff were very friendly. Overall it was a nice experience. There were not too many people in Stephanie's the day we visited, but the food might have taken a bit longer than expected to be served. I orderd a Tuna Tartare and a Ceasar salad, my friend ordered some fish and chips, the meal was fulfilling. The portion is good for the price, and the atmosphere is also cozy on a cold day. Great place for brunch. Food was great and service was super friendly. Our server, I don\u2019t remember her name \ud83e\udee3, but she was super friendly and funny. The country Greek salad was really good, the portion size is large! It was very fresh and a good option if you want something that will make you feel light afterwards. The tuna tartare was really good too and the chips it comes with were super crunchy and delicious to pair it up. Thanks for everything. Food is AMAZING! For the price you pay for the items on the menu is completely worth it. I feel everywhere else in Boston is overcharged for what you are getting.\n\nVery disappointed that the banana bread with the raspberry and PB is no longer on the menu\u2026 it was DELICIOUS! Had a great brunch outside recently and it was flawless. Great vibes, great food, amazing service.\n\nWould highly recommend. Food is top notch, great quality, with amazing portion sizes.\n\nIt's in the heart of Newbury in the best location and very easy to get to (very walkable).\n\nDefinitely make a reservation, too. It can get pretty busy given how popular Newbury is. Stephanie\u2019s on Newbury is a wonderful spot for casual yet upscale dining, offering classic American comfort food with a twist.

It\u2019s an excellent place for both locals and visitors to relax and enjoy a good meal in the heart of Boston. Great location and view of the city.  Service was fast. Food was yummy. Bathroom was clean and stocked. The place is a little small and stuffy in the first floor, but great otherwise! Agonizingly, unbelievably slow service. Pictured are all employees with their back to customers, a common sight in this location. Short or long line makes no difference, it takes ages to get food. You'll also notice the employee Angela without a mask on, in direct violation of the local mask mandate.\n\nDo not be sucked in by the low prices and mobile offers, do not come here. I ordered ahead on mobile thinking it would shorten my wait, but instead it caused 10 minutes of confusion as I was passed from one staff member to the next, none of whom could locate my food or recall my order. If I hadn't already spent the money I would have left out of frustration. It's a fine Wendy's, although at least during my visit, there was lots of mess on the tables. But the food was fine, especially the fries. Fast service reasonable prices. Food tastes good enough for what it is. Several healthy salad options too. The kids burgers had very thin patties and too well cooked....might be for safety.....but my picky girls ate them without complaint. Find it much!!! better than BK not McD though. This is an okay place the only Wendy's around that I'm aware of. The last time I was there there was a cashier with a language barrier and she seemed to get frustrated when I did not understand her, I was equally frustrated on my end not understanding what she was trying to tell me. The food was good, temperature good and the place was clean. Not a regular stop for me, it's a place I go into now and then. I'm not really a meat eater so I usually get a baked potato or fries and a coffee. Really wish they had friendlier staff who was able to speak the language that I understand, which is English. Can't even roll a basic burrito, not even with 2 wraps. Also, there is nothing but trash in the upstairs dining area, which they evidently never clean. Don't come here, but if you do, definitely don't get the burrito. Normally, a burrito is supposed to come apart when you eat it. But with this Chipotle, the burrito is already apart when they give it to you. It's technically not even a burrito at that point, just a bunch of glop with a tortilla. If you crave Southeastern food, there are many better options nearby.\n0/10, stay away. I chose a bowl with white rice, brown beans, salad, white sour cream, and chicken. It was just okay; I think part of the reason it didn't taste great was that I was there at 9 PM, and none of the ingredients, especially the chicken and guacamole, felt fresh. While this isn't a huge issue, the quality shouldn't depend on the time of day. The service was probably okay, but the atmosphere was disappointing with dirty tables and a dark, dingy ambiance. My one complaint about this location is that the seating area is overrun with migrant door dash drivers lounging. They take up half the seating. I\u2019m not exaggerating, every time I\u2019m here there are no less than 20 delivery scooters parked in the bike lane out front. I\u2019m convinced all the door dash/Uber eats drivers hang out here and wait for orders. I was gifted this free entree card, and the staff was helpful\nbut needed the assistance of the manager, a young woman, to\nsee  how the card could be processed.\nThis was on Tuesday, December 17, 2024, around 6 pm.\nThe manager was extremely helpful & pleasant, even with a busy restaurant, so i just wanted to express my appreciation. Service was terrible, my friend didn\u2019t get her drink, chips, my burrito fell apart, i couldn\u2019t cap my bowl, my friend couldn\u2019t cap hers. food decent, a fellow costumer spilt the drink, this is the outcome of my burrito, and my bag wouldn\u2019t fold, so i had to use a hair tie. Incredible place that we just happened upon while walking to a different place. The food is incredible and very, very cared about with the flavor and presentation. Service is top notch - Patrick took amazing care of us and our family throughout the whole visit! Visiting from out of town, this will definitely be a place I come back as often as I can. So good! The elote chowder was very flavorful, and the sweet & sour chicken strips were really good too. I would order each of those items again. **Review:**\n\nParish has a cool, laid-back vibe that makes for a great dining experience. We tried the eggplant burger, and it exceeded our expectations \u2013 absolutely delicious! Lucy served us today, and she was wonderful. Her kindness and friendly demeanor made our visit even more enjoyable. Thank you, Lucy, for the great service, 5-star well deserved! We highly recommend this place! What a deliciously unique concept! Love the selection of chef-created sandwich options... and their cocktails were uniquely crafted.\n\nPumpkin Espresso Martini\nSweater Weather Cocktail\nPaolo's Peasant Panini with Turkey + Salad\nTomato Bisque (dipped sandwich in it)\nClam Chowder\nSpaceboy Shawarma (spiced SO well)\n\nEverything was very good! The food came out very quickly (within 10 minutes of ordering). Service was nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, would recommend for couples, family, kids, etc. Lots of menu options! We went for half off sandwiches and it was absolutely delicious. The house made pickles they put on the sandwiches were amazing as well, I had to ask if I could buy a small container. They were super nice about it and allowed me to buy a small one. We also got their strawberry mint lemonade mocktail which was really good. Would definitely come back to try their other sandwiches! I was not looking for dinner \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f but I was becoming hungry. I walked past the window \ud83e\ude9f seats of this restaurant and the food looked good! After walking Newbury Street, I decided to try here. Expecting a window seat \ud83e\ude91, which to me is great \ud83d\udc4d, I was taken downstairs to a comfortable booth to my surprise \ud83e\udee2.\nI had multiple servers and all of them were great! I had the Chicken Piccata with complimentary fresh bread \ud83c\udf5e and butter. Yummy \ud83d\ude0b!\nClassic rock \ud83e\udea8 played at a quiet level \ud83c\udf9a\ufe0f. The overhead lights dimmed a bit as the sun \u2600\ufe0f set.  The bathroom was in good shape. I used to run janitorial crews so I cannot help but notice.\nI had a better time than I expected! Prices are typical of running a business in Boston. You are a \ud83e\udea8 stones, not Rolling, throw from the Commonwealth Avenue Mall if you want to walk off a few calories.\nI recommend a visit! From the girls that seated me to my waitress Anna was top notch. If you wanna eat good n feel good come here. I don\u2019t have 215k views for nothing. Amazing place amazing people amazing food. Joe\u2019s actually really surprised me. My sister and I kicked it off with a round of espresso martinis which were great. My brother got coffee which they pour straight from a nice little pot.\n\nI got the classic American breakfast which was delicious. The sausages were flavorful and the potatoes were perfectly cooked + seasoned. The eggs were very basic but that seems to be the norm at breakfast places these days. I stole bacon from my dad and it was great as well. Lastly, they have a gluten free toast option which was way better than I expected. Reservations for dinner on a weekend trip to Cambridge. Busy place! Service was okay. Thankfully the chef took my wife's food allergy seriously because it felt like the server blew it off but then she was back after the chef had more questions. Food was very good. Instead of dinner we got a bunch of apps and sides. Starter bread was fantastic. Place was pretty cool, only wish it was less family friendly because some parents were not controlling their children. Very good bourbon sour. Me, my husband and friend ate here for the first time, made a reservation the night of and had no problem getting in. All the food was really good. I had the cheeseburger egg rolls, meatloaf and my husband got a burger. My friend hot the chicken pot pie. Overall it was a good priced menu with good options to choose from. If you\u2019re looking for bagels in Back Bay, this is one of your few options. This two-story spot has seating and is pretty quick in terms of service. There is a nice quantity of meat on the egg and cheese sandwiches. The bagels are kind of too soft even when toasted but generally good. The service was quick when we went on a weekday morning. We ordered online and it was ready in less than five minutes after placing it. They have a large variety of bagels to choose from. We got the chocolate chip and sesame bagels, which were okay. I would warn that the bagel with butter was very greasy so take napkins if ordering that. I recently ordered bagels from here and they were just okay. They felt like they were starting to get a bit stale because they did not taste as fresh as I might have expected. The cream cheese was good\u2014I enjoyed that. I prefer my bagels to have a crunchier outside but then soft as you bite into it and so these bagels did not quite deliver. I would be willing to come back here and try again, but overall I would say they were mediocre at best. Perfectly baked bagel, really fluffy, nice cheese cheese! Highly recommend, would always get back! We went here specifically because I saw that they had whole wheat everything bagels, which I usually love and haven't found elsewhere in Boston. I ordered the bacon egg and cheese on a bagel. The egg and bacon were well cooked; the yolk was soft but not runny (I love runny eggs but have to avoid them right now, so this worked well for me). The cheese (I think a white cheddar) didn't totally mesh with the flavors the way I had hoped, though that may just be down to personal preference. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the bagel itself. I ordered a toasted sandwich, and my impression is that  they put the whole sandwich in the toaster rather than toasting the bagel and then constructing the sandwich. Because of this, the interior of the bagel was soft and didn't have any crunch to provide texture contrast with the fillings. For that reason, with many other bagel shops to try in the area, I likely won't be back.\nService was friendly and fast. Can't even roll a basic burrito, not even with 2 wraps. Also, there is nothing but trash in the upstairs dining area, which they evidently never clean. Don't come here, but if you do, definitely don't get the burrito.

I\u2019m convinced all the door dash/Uber eats drivers hang out here and wait for orders. I was gifted this free entree card, and the staff was helpful\nbut needed the assistance of the manager, a young woman, to\nsee  how the card could be processed.\nThis was on Tuesday, December 17, 2024, around 6 pm.\nThe manager was extremely helpful & pleasant, even with a busy restaurant, so i just wanted to express my appreciation. Service was terrible, my friend didn\u2019t get her drink, chips, my burrito fell apart, i couldn\u2019t cap my bowl, my friend couldn\u2019t cap hers. food decent, a fellow costumer spilt the drink, this is the outcome of my burrito, and my bag wouldn\u2019t fold, so i had to use a hair tie. Incredible place that we just happened upon while walking to a different place. The food is incredible and very, very cared about with the flavor and presentation. Service is top notch - Patrick took amazing care of us and our family throughout the whole visit! Visiting from out of town, this will definitely be a place I come back as often as I can. So good! The elote chowder was very flavorful, and the sweet & sour chicken strips were really good too. I would order each of those items again. **Review:**\n\nParish has a cool, laid-back vibe that makes for a great dining experience. We tried the eggplant burger, and it exceeded our expectations \u2013 absolutely delicious! Lucy served us today, and she was wonderful. Her kindness and friendly demeanor made our visit even more enjoyable. Thank you, Lucy, for the great service, 5-star well deserved! We highly recommend this place! What a deliciously unique concept! Love the selection of chef-created sandwich options... and their cocktails were uniquely crafted.\n\nPumpkin Espresso Martini\nSweater Weather Cocktail\nPaolo's Peasant Panini with Turkey + Salad\nTomato Bisque (dipped sandwich in it)\nClam Chowder\nSpaceboy Shawarma (spiced SO well)\n\nEverything was very good! The food came out very quickly (within 10 minutes of ordering). Service was nice and attentive.\n\nOverall, would recommend for couples, family, kids, etc. Lots of menu options! We went for half off sandwiches and it was absolutely delicious. The house made pickles they put on the sandwiches were amazing as well, I had to ask if I could buy a small container. They were super nice about it and allowed me to buy a small one. We also got their strawberry mint lemonade mocktail which was really good. Would definitely come back to try their other sandwiches! I was not looking for dinner \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f but I was becoming hungry. I walked past the window \ud83e\ude9f seats of this restaurant and the food looked good! After walking Newbury Street, I decided to try here. Expecting a window seat \ud83e\ude91, which to me is great \ud83d\udc4d, I was taken downstairs to a comfortable booth to my surprise \ud83e\udee2.\nI had multiple servers and all of them were great! I had the Chicken Piccata with complimentary fresh bread \ud83c\udf5e and butter. Yummy \ud83d\ude0b!\nClassic rock \ud83e\udea8 played at a quiet level \ud83c\udf9a\ufe0f. The overhead lights dimmed a bit as the sun \u2600\ufe0f set.  The bathroom was in good shape. I used to run janitorial crews so I cannot help but notice.\nI had a better time than I expected! Prices are typical of running a business in Boston. You are a \ud83e\udea8 stones, not Rolling, throw from the Commonwealth Avenue Mall if you want to walk off a few calories.\nI recommend a visit! From the girls that seated me to my waitress Anna was top notch. If you wanna eat good n feel good come here. I don\u2019t have 215k views for nothing. Amazing place amazing people amazing food. Joe\u2019s actually really surprised me. My sister and I kicked it off with a round of espresso martinis which were great. My brother got coffee which they pour straight from a nice little pot.\n\nI got the classic American breakfast which was delicious. The sausages were flavorful and the potatoes were perfectly cooked + seasoned. The eggs were very basic but that seems to be the norm at breakfast places these days. I stole bacon from my dad and it was great as well. Lastly, they have a gluten free toast option which was way better than I expected. Reservations for dinner on a weekend trip to Cambridge. Busy place! Service was okay. Thankfully the chef took my wife's food allergy seriously because it felt like the server blew it off but then she was back after the chef had more questions. Food was very good. Instead of dinner we got a bunch of apps and sides. Starter bread was fantastic. Place was pretty cool, only wish it was less family friendly because some parents were not controlling their children. Very good bourbon sour. Me, my husband and friend ate here for the first time, made a reservation the night of and had no problem getting in. All the food was really good. I had the cheeseburger egg rolls, meatloaf and my husband got a burger. My friend hot the chicken pot pie. Overall it was a good priced menu with good options to choose from. If you\u2019re looking for bagels in Back Bay, this is one of your few options. This two-story spot has seating and is pretty quick in terms of service. There is a nice quantity of meat on the egg and cheese sandwiches. The bagels are kind of too soft even when toasted but generally good. The service was quick when we went on a weekday morning. We ordered online and it was ready in less than five minutes after placing it. They have a large variety of bagels to choose from. We got the chocolate chip and sesame bagels, which were okay. I would warn that the bagel with butter was very greasy so take napkins if ordering that. I recently ordered bagels from here and they were just okay. They felt like they were starting to get a bit stale because they did not taste as fresh as I might have expected. The cream cheese was good\u2014I enjoyed that. I prefer my bagels to have a crunchier outside but then soft as you bite into it and so these bagels did not quite deliver. I would be willing to come back here and try again, but overall I would say they were mediocre at best. Perfectly baked bagel, really fluffy, nice cheese cheese! Highly recommend, would always get back! We went here specifically because I saw that they had whole wheat everything bagels, which I usually love and haven't found elsewhere in Boston. I ordered the bacon egg and cheese on a bagel. The egg and bacon were well cooked; the yolk was soft but not runny (I love runny eggs but have to avoid them right now, so this worked well for me). The cheese (I think a white cheddar) didn't totally mesh with the flavors the way I had hoped, though that may just be down to personal preference. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the bagel itself. I ordered a toasted sandwich, and my impression is that  they put the whole sandwich in the toaster rather than toasting the bagel and then constructing the sandwich. Because of this, the interior of the bagel was soft and didn't have any crunch to provide texture contrast with the fillings. For that reason, with many other bagel shops to try in the area, I likely won't be back.\nService was friendly and fast. The restaurant offerings are all vegetarian, with some vegan. That\u2019s ethical. But all the entrees are deep fried, laden with fat. That\u2019s bad. The employees are paid upwards of $20 an hour. That\u2019s good. But small lunch, served over the counter, costs almost $30. That\u2019s expensive (and they still expect a tip, too). The long wooden communal table is nice, but it is so dirty, it's gross.\n\nOverall: this is not a new place. It should do better. So delicious! I had a kidney bean, cilantro, and banana salad and the falafel skewers which were both fabulous and affordable. I\u2019d highly recommend the food here and the mission of supporting local food and food producers is such a wonderful bonus. The sandwiches and the mushroom soup were both amazing. Nice bright atmosphere with a big shared table, and we appreciated the AC on a hot day in Boston. Pros:\nvegan restaurant.\n\nLiked the food.\n\nGot chickpea platter, with soup on the side.\n\nIt's easy to reach here via public transit or blue bikes.\n\nCons:\nwe were a group of 22 people so finding seating in the same dining space was difficult, half of us sat inside and the other half outside.\n\nRestrooms were not super clean. Mediterranean cuisine fresh and fast. Best fries in Boston. Have the fritter sandwich; it's great, Bread somes right out of the oven. The felafel sandwich also great, with tangy toppings and sauce. WOW Last minute choice and pleasantly surprised the flavor of the chicken sandwich was \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d. Everything was amazing can\u2019t wait to try more dinner options!!!! Modern take on Chinese bowls. The Classic BBQ Tofu was my choice. Terrific. My partner made a bowl of farro, carrots and salmon. So good! An amazing place to have a quick bite and satisfy those hunger cravings. I loved the vibe in there and the atmosphere.\n\nWe had ordered two vegetarian bowls.\n\nThe first one was a no protein with a base of brown rice, sided with herb marinated cannellini beans, tomatoes and cucumbers and charred broccoli with lemon.\n\nThe other one was a crispy tofu (it wasn't maple glazed and surprisingly wasn't crispy at all). It had a spiced farro base sided with cashews kale caesar and charred broccoli with lemon.\n\nI loved the sauces (Pesto, Sriracha and Garlic Aioli)\n\nThe only concern I had was with the quantity of the food and the price paid for it.\n\nThe food was delicious without a doubt, charred broccoli was just astonishing and cashew kale was the best! I even tried spiced farro for the first time and it was amazing!\n\nIf you have quite an appetite, one bowl is NOT enough for you but if you have a decent appetite, one bowl will get you through the time. The workers at dig back bay are very accommodating and friendly. Great service, great food and great location. They build relationships with frequent customers which makes the experience even better. By far my favorite place to eat in Boston! Food so good I could eat the veggies everyday. The employees looked miserable n9t one smile . No one was conversing with each other or the guests. The eat in areas were messy and the bathrooms were not clean but the food itself one of my favorite spots in  Boston Although it can seem a bit pricey, it is fantastic value because of the high quality sashimi grade fish they use! Rivals those of even the fanciest restaurants in terms of freshness, but at a far better price. Even their fried ice cream is great (and a wonderful way to finish off a meal)! Quality of sushi is okay, price (especially for dinner) is also not the greatest given the quality. Everything is simply mediocre. The sushi is definitely better than the appetizers (don\u2019t get the tempura, shrimp tempura, katsu) they\u2019re not worth your stomach space \u2014 other than maybe the fried pork gyozas. Those are okay. But the sushi is okay\u2026 honestly I\u2019d rather spend $38 on a la carte sushi that tastes better!! You don\u2019t need to eat 40 pieces of sushi anyways lol\u2026 Sushi took a while to come out but everything tasted really good and fresh! It\u2019s okay given the price and it\u2019s all you can eat, I\u2019ll suggest visit during lunch time cuz the price for dinner it\u2019s higher and probably not worth it. The breading for tempura is too thick but the sushi is good. It takes a while for the waiter to take your order when there are many people. If you don\u2019t eat much, it is not the best place, since you can get better quality food for the same price.\n\nBut if you want to eat a lot, including sashimi and rolls - this is the place.  The quality of fish is fine.\nService is fine too. *positive*\nThis restaurant is a must try! Great atmosphere, good food and just very chic overall.\n\n*not so positive feedback*\nUnfortunately, we (party of 4) didn\u2019t love our server. Our drinks took 20minutes to come out, we ordered hot sauce to come out with the drinks (bloody Mary\u2019s) and it never came.\nWe asked multiple times but we were unsuccessful getting it with the drinks and actually for most of the apps as we wanted to put it on the caviar and tinned fish.\nAlso, the tinned fish (another app) came out much later then the first two apps and when the server brought it over, he told us the delay was because he was checking the three cans to make sure there were no peanuts in them as my friend had a peanut allergy. It just seemed like shifting the blame so we weren\u2019t upset that it took so long.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our brunch, but the service could\u2019ve been a lot better and faster. This server could\u2019ve been more attentive.\nI definitely would not recommend the rolled omelette. Overcooked.\n\nI would definitely go back in the future for the atmosphere in the food. Saltie Girl is hands down one of the best dining experiences I\u2019ve had in Boston. From the moment you step inside, the chic, intimate vibe sets the stage for an unforgettable meal. It\u2019s the kind of place that manages to feel both upscale and relaxed at the same time.\n\nThe seafood here is next-level fresh and beautifully prepared. I started with the tinned fish board\u2014an absolute must-try\u2014and every bite was a flavor explosion. The lobster roll was buttery, perfectly seasoned, and loaded with fresh lobster, easily one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. The warm buttered brioche just took it over the top.\n\nDrinks were also on point. The cocktail menu is creative and well-executed, with options that pair perfectly with the menu. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable and made great suggestions throughout the night.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a local or visiting Boston, Saltie Girl is a must for any seafood lover. It\u2019s worth the hype\u2014and then some. I visited for a solo lunch on my birthday. I decided to be seated near the window to enjoy the beautiful weather! My waiter was so sweet and attentive. I enjoyed everything. I ordered the petite tower and everything was SUPERB! The best oysters I\u2019ve ever had \ud83e\udd70 I ordered the Pineapple x 2, which was very refreshing and not too sweet. The French Burgundy Snails were perfect. And lastly the warm spicy king crab roll was the perfect warm item I needed after eating all the delicious seafood tower choices. I also had the chocolate caviar and espresso martini for dessert. Michelin style dining without pretension. Everything was wonderful, and everyone there was so friendly. At first I thought \u201cwhy fry good lobster\u201d, but decided to try the waffle and fried lobster. Absolutely perfect! Same with the tinned menu. Such a good way to start the meal. My wife got the fish and chips, and kept saying \u201cwow\u201d hahaha We will absolutely be back when in town! My husband took me here for the first time for my birthday. We enjoyed everything we ordered. I love picking apart fish, so the Halibut Collar was a great dish for me. The scallop was exceptionally good! We got the pistachio tiramisu for dessert and it wasn\u2019t too sweet! Just sweet enough that I can still taste other flavors. Overall a great experience! I\u2019m a regular happy CAVA Prudential customer and love the food and their customer service but past Wednesday I went to the Back Bay one and for my surprise, I was treated just as special as I\u2019ve always been by their team! For my surprise this gentleman Martino was there on that day and with the biggest and happiest, smile he ran from inside the kitchen to say hello to me and personally helped me with my order! What a genuine and  welcoming guy! His friendly and professional attitude made my day and also made me think how important it is to love what you do and it will naturally shines out to the world. Very inspirational!\nThank you CAVA for keep bringing us delicious Mediterranean food and for having the greatest staff that in many cases might be as important as the meal itself for keeping us coming back regularly!\n\nCheers!!!!! I\u2019ve been ordering online pick up for a few years for lunch. Recently, the portions are getting worse. For $16 you\u2019re basically getting 8 bites from it. Best if  you go in stand in line for 30 min to receive a better portions\u2026 Compared to the other CAVA locations I have been to, this location is SO superb it is not even comparable to any other. If I wasn't currently employed I would want to work here. Their managing staff must really be incredible. I love this location so much that I would travel across Boston simply to eat at this location. Any type of franchise is always hit or miss but this CAVA?! Rest assured, this is where you want to have lunch today and EVERY day. CAVA, fast-casual build-your-own Mediterranean, is very high on our taste-per-dollar index. Everybody should know the advantages of the \u201cMediterranean Diet\u201d by now, and this place offers these benefits at a very high taste quality but low price point. For gut biome fans, you can get your 20 different vegetables on one plate here, quickly, without wasting food.\nThe grilled meats are divinely seasoned as they sizzle on the flame grill, the sauces are diverse and savory, and the staff cares about what they\u2019re doing, knowing that they\u2019re doing good for people with the food they serve. Fresh and tasty. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of ingredients. Quick serve restaurant that does it well. I ordered the spaghetti and \u2018meatballs\u2019. One of the heartiest and healthiest meals I\u2019ve had from these health food restaurants. It was made of zucchini noodles, eggplant meatballs, marinara, kale, grape tomatoes, and parmesan grated on top. SO GOOD! However, the burgers were subpar and I wouldn\u2019t recommend them. This place is about the bowls! Staff that cannot take an order. On her phone. Forgot the cheese. It hasn\u2019t rained for three hours, it\u2019s a beautiful summer night, yet the staff has not dried off the outdoor tables. Cava, next door, is on top of things. Ha, and my 7 year just told me, \u201cThey have terrible burgers.\u201d  She\u2019s right. I'm sorry to write a mediocre review for such a nice place, but we visited on a Sunday at lunch time and the service was slow and mediocre, apparently because they were understaffed. People were waiting in line just to place an order, as there was no one at the cashier.\n\nHigh prices, small portions. No shade umbrellas outside. Not a great experience  :-/ We chose this for our first meal in Boston during a recent visit to the city, mainly because of the good reviews. And we couldn't agree more. The food is flavorful and filling and was priced fairly. We also liked the cozy and non-intimidating vibe of the store.\n\nThe store also has some neat things on display. One is a small greenhouse by the dining area where they grow the mint used on their food. Another is a sign by the entrance that shows where they source their ingredients for the day - from Sharon, MA to Monroe, NH. Great to see them promoting their local partners. Will definitely come back next time we're in the city! I had an amazing veggie burger for lunch at B.Good!\n\nHere are some details on how they built my burger:\nAvocado Puree\nChipotle Puree\nTomato - Sliced\nPickled Red Onions\nVeggie Burger\n\nI also had some random drink. Lol Sweetgreen is one of my top places for a great salad. I always get the Kale Caesar, and it never disappoints. The service is fast, and the staff is consistently friendly. Definitely recommend for a quick, healthy meal. I\u2019ve previously been to the seaport location, so I thought to give this place a try as well. Tight seating, but the interior was clean. Ordered the Ranchy chicken+rice kids meal since I wasn\u2019t feeling too hungry. Unfortunately the rice was inedible because it was almost raw. Tiny pebbles in my mouth. Either a bad batch or inexperienced staff. The chicken was also a tad dry, but my girlfriend\u2019s green goddess salad wasn\u2019t too bad. Kale Caesar salad from this place is my favorite health food at around 450 calories. The staffs are very polite and friendly and there\u2019s not much wait time. The only caveat is the store does not have a water machine. Addition of water to the store would be really great. I love sitting on the chair outside the store and do people watching at Copley Sq. The store is conveniently located right off Copley Square green line MBTA. The prices are reasonable. The portions are filling.\n\nUpdate: today I tried guacamole \ud83e\udd51 greens with green goddess dressing and I really liked it. Highly recommend it. Sweetgreen is always reliable for a fast and healthy lunch. They have bowls and salads to choose from, but you can also build your own. Ton of options for vegans and vegetarians. Outdoor and indoor seating. Space is a little tight and it was very busy during lunch time, but the staff were very fast and friendly. Today I went there for the first time. I ordered  a bowl and a salad and both of them included hair strand (long and curvy) which is  nauseous :(  I wasted them, never will go again SG. Fantastic place for quick eats. As their name goes, Pr\u00eat-a-manger means ready to eat. I\u2019m completely hooked on to their tomato & feta soup. Perfect taste, served hot. Just add a bit of pepper to enhance the taste a little more. Their orange-mango juice is worth trying too. I\u2019ll definitely recommend a visit and the next time I swing by, I\u2019ll try out their coffee. Friendly staff, food was frehyand good quality but this is NOT a vegan friendly place. They only had two vegan food options (not counting an inexpensive cup of miso soup that was pretty good) and one was sold out. No automatic door but otherwise very accessible for wheelchairs, especially spacious interior and moveable chairs and tables. Service was particularly courteous. Love it. Organic food and seems healthy . Good atmosphere Same as the UK.   If you're looking for a good sandwich, snack and coffee this is  the spot.  We should replace our fast food culture with this we'd be way better off. Sat here for a coffee and being from abroad I wondered to myself where is the building they used in Boston legal. I Google searched and what do you know it's right across the street So I\u2019ve been going to this restaurant for years. It\u2019s very close to the Copley branch of the library and so conveniently located and just a super reliable spot for lunch. Probably my default option when I\u2019m looking for something near Copley.\n\nToday I had the spicy tofu lunch special which came with some small pork dumplings (I could have had spring rolls instead). The flavor of my meal was spot on, just the way I like it. Tofu wasn\u2019t great by themselves but the flavor was there. Dumplings were also just fine. From prior experience I would recommend the basil fried rice and they have this eggplant thing which I think is my favorite thing I\u2019ve tried there. Also the fresh Basil rolls are also really good.\n\nI will say, it\u2019s extremely standard Thai food and I don\u2019t think it cracks my top three Thai restaurants around boston, but it is tasty, reasonably priced, and great location. I\u2019ve probably eaten there close to twenty times. For me it\u2019s a comfort lunch at this point. I was excited to visit this restaurant as my two friends that just moved in the area had a good experience. Sadly this time we had a pretty disturbing experience. Personally I enjoyed my food, which was the Spicy Chicken and Garlic Wok.\n\nOur server, the older woman who I assume runs the place, was pretty rude from the beginning when I asked her if they had sweet iced tea. Me and the two other people in my party were very easy guests, ordering a total of 1 appetizer, and each a meal and a beverage. We were never checked in on and once the food was ready, the server came from behind me and basically shoved the first plate in front of me with an abrupt \"excuse me.\"\n\nBeing that our server was not very attentive and even aggressive, I left a modest 10% tip. Our server came back to our table after I paid and hounded me on paying what she claimed was a standard 18% tip. I was astonished as that has never happened in any restaurant I've been to. My party and I immediately left after I ensured her I would leave a review.\n\nIf I were not with such close friends, this could have been much more disturbing/humiliating.\n\nI would not give this woman business. I recommend Bangkok Bento down the road!!! Ok they didn\u2019t have flat noodles that\u2019s why it\u2019s 4 stars. But over all pretty good flavors. I ordered the late which was good. And yes they adjust to your spice level. It's my go-to spot for thai food, the flavors are fabulous, the food comes out quickly and the service is amazing. Portions are VERY generous for the price, and the service is always good. Greta for walking in or reservations, I only have lovely things to say about it! The food was okay, but it lacked flavor; however, the portions were good. We left a tip, but before we left, the staff questioned us about the amount and suggested we adjust it to a figure they preferred. We found this request to be quite rude, so we decided not to change it and left the restaurant. Had higher expectations of this place seeing as it\u2019s just a skip and hop away from the convention center. Not sure how folks are rating so high (perhaps lack of other options or limited palate or.. who knows what).\n\nAtmosphere was fine. Kind of reminiscent of a female college dorm after multiple trips to Target\u2019s home section?\n\nThere\u2019s large fan on behind the counter which may have been the problem behind the cashier mishearing an item on our order (gave us the Classic Burger instead Guac Burger). Fries were standard, beet ketchup is fine but would be nice to offer regular ketchup.\n\nThe Classic Burger was boring and had nothing special about it - the \u2018special sauce\u2019 was undetectable. Red Robin\u2019s vegan burgers are more memorable.\n\nThe Chicky Salad was mostly romaine lettuce with the equivalent of two Gardein chicken fingers diagonally cut. Nothing stand out here either.\n\nThe redeeming points about the restaurant was that it\u2019s vegan, a decent selection of drinks (less common seltzers, kombucha, water boxes, etc) and price point. For a burger, fries, salad, and two seltzers - $36. Meh? Love love love this vegan restaurant! It was my first time in Boston and we googled Vegan restaurants.  This one came up so we thought we\u2019d give it a try.  So glad we did! We ate there for lunch and then returned for dinner that same day.  Customer service at the counter was just okay, but the food was amazing and prices were reasonably low!  Highly recommend! My partner recently found out that he is lactose intolerant. Lately I have been looking around for places that we both can enjoy together and came across Beatnic. We both aren't vegan however we like to try new things and switch it up. Absolutely delicious! Definitely will be ordering again Luminous and huge 100% vegan restaurant with amazing burgers. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\n\n\ud83d\udc96We ordered:\nTHE GUAC BURGER\nTHE BCB BURGER\nPEANUT BUTTER COOKIE\nTWO DRINKS (yuzu and lemon flavour). Went here when it was known as ByChloe - different name now but the menu and interior is still the same!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find out that food is 50% off from 3pm-9pm which was amazing! I got the loaded fries and it was great. It\u2019s very quiet compared to how it used to be but I like it a lot. Will definitely be visiting soon\u2026 The restaurant was busy, but it didn\u2019t take too long to find a table. The food was excellent, very fresh and healthy. The staff were very busy, but did a good job, the only possible, it would be more frequent table wiping after people have finished eating. There's a good selection of warm healthy food. I enjoyed the cold pressed juices which were so refreshing. The cafe was so busy and it was difficult to get a table during lunch. Had to wait for quite a while to get sitting space even at the front counter area. The avocado toast and breakfast burrito were good. The food portions were good. Came here for the first time, after seeing that it was ranked #1 Boston for healthy eatery. I'm always trying to find a place that is both healthy and yummy. It DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Impressive assortment of healthy options in both meals, acai bowls, and drinks. They are not particularly TRADITIONAL (eg no green beans or Red beets in true Korean bibimbap) but definitely an healthy alternative with the same concept and design. I'm not sure what exactly defines a Buddha Bowl (is it the particular ingredients or the sauce... The last one I had it at another place had pumpkin/sweet potatoes but this one had avocado with mushroom). It was tangy and flavorful however. Went well with the Brown rice and chia seeds. Also my friend of Lebanese origin mentioned that the falafel was crispy and \"not bad\". Tried the Blue Breeze, it was thick and tasted mostly like ground banana. Will try something else next time. The tahini latte tasted like latte and much lighter. Next time I want to try to bibimbap and also some of the acai bowls.\n\nThe place was full of people and noisy, it was hard to find seats. I found their system really efficient, however, where you wait in a line to order at the counter and pay, and then get a table number, get seated, they bring you the food, you eat and leave. No need to wait around so long to grab an attention of a waiter. The bathroom was clean and well-maintained. The staff were friendly. I liked the vibrant feel of the place. It was an interesting design (there are a lot more tables INSIDE, FYI). Gave 4/5 for atmosphere because we struggled to find a table and found a little corner of a larger table to gather together, and no-one seemed to offer assistance with the struggle... And sometimes it got too noisy. But speaks to how popular this place is!\n\nWould definitely come back!!! food was pretty good, we got the buddha bowl (which was fine) and the peanut butter smoothie (which i love). straw kinda broke though. i also think there could be more seating and the atmosphere could be quirkier and less \u201chippie-style-corporate.\u201d but great for a fun lunch. We discovered this place by chance and were pleasantly surprised. They have an extensive selection of vegetarian dishes and were very accommodating of my dietary restrictions. The ambiance is clean and inviting, and the service is warm and friendly.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Peanut Noodles, and they were absolutely delicious\u2014just what I had hoped for.\n\nThis spot is definitely worth checking out. I stopped by this Smashburger in search of two things. A filling meal, and a restroom for paying customers. I was thrilled to be served with both.\nThe burger i got was delicious on the egg bun used. Adds a special flavor to the cushion that is the bun.\nThe sweet potato fries were 9.8/10 salted perfectly.\nStaff was very friendly and seemingly family or very close. I enjoy seeing many hard workers here in Boston Great experience! They were understaffed and trying to keep up with the lunch rush on a Wednesday. But they exceeded expectations! The woman running the front was so sweet to us and got food to us so fast while also handling a 15 item order at the same time. The cooks were fast and made AMAZING food. They accidentally gave us sides of fries instead of the tray, but the manager who was also running the floor gave us a tray of fries as extra just because. She gave us the smash fries topping on the side for us and treated us with such care. 10/10 loved this place and the employees. Stopped here because it looked good and so glad we did! Food was perfect and the smash fries were to die for! Bianca was so kind and helpful and made sure our food and service was to our satisfaction. I\u2019ll definitely be back!! 10/10 We\u2019ve ate here before in the last few years.\nIt was good before. Can\u2019t say same for this visit.\nFood was ok but service and place was bad. Pretty much every employee on their phone. Smashburger recently had me thoroughly impressed with both their food and service. As soon as I stepped inside, I was greeted with a warm smile from the friendly staff, who said her name was jonairy.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the classic Smash, The patty was complemented by fresh toppings and a soft, toasted bun. I also had smash fries! They were delicious.\n\nWhat really captured my attention at Smashburger was their outstanding customer service. The staff was attentive yet not overbearing, ensuring that my meal was just right and that my dining area was kept clean and comfortable. They were also knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations.\n\nDefinitely would come again! \ud83d\ude0e How many times have I been to this place: 1\n\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbc Summary: Another disastrous experience.\n\ud83c\udf79 Juice Quality: I visited Juice Press for the first time, craving a fresh and delicious smoothie. However, I was disappointed to find that the regular smoothie cost over $12 and lacked freshness. It was bland and did not live up to my expectations.\n\ud83e\uddf9 Cleanliness: What shocked me even more was the store's cleanliness. The place was dirty, and it seemed like they never swept the floor. It's disheartening that a place that promotes healthy lifestyles neglects to keep their establishment clean and inviting.\n\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Would I revisit this place? No, I would not return to Juice Press. Instead, I would prefer to get fresh fruits from Whole Foods and make my own smoothie. The high cost, lack of flavor, and poor cleanliness make this an unsatisfactory choice for me. Nice , modern shop of healthy drinks and snacks.\n\nFruit/vegan/healthy smoothies, drinks and shakes. Protein addition available. Special, innovative recipes for the drinks and the smoothies with healthy and fresh ingredients.\n\nHealthy and vegan bowls, and packaged finer , granola/oats and other healthy snacks and refrigerated snacks available.\n\nGiving it 4 stars because service could be faster. Pretty good spot if you\u2019re looking for recovery or something healthy. They have bowls and smoothies. I got the chocolate protein smoothie with blueberries and two additional scoops of protein. Taste wise it was alright but it does the job actually very good! the a\u00e7ai was flavourful and not too sweet or tart. same goes for the granola. there are several reviews complaining about the size of the bowl and the price, but i actually thought it was a very decent amount and the price wasn\u2019t a deal, but i didn\u2019t think it was above average for the size of other smoothie bowls. the only comment i would have i that i wish there were more options for fruit toppings rather than just frozen blueberries. other than that, i really enjoyed the a\u00e7ai bowl and love that it\u2019s all vegan! #Racism# I walked in to Juice Press in the BackBay area near my job on12/26/2023 around 11:55am.  I ordered green smoothie and the cashier questioned me several times about my \u201c$20 dollar bill\u201d. She thought I was paying with fake money, even though I am clearly dressed up. I had to tell her that I work for the real estate development company that is down the street from this place and I had to assured her that my $20 dollar bill was not fake! The guy that was standing behind me was also very upset at this situation and unprofessional behavior from this person. As a person of color, I was extremely offended and I will never go back to this place. The cleanest fast food chain I've ever visited. The food and the chick-fil-a sauce were delicous. I recommended u to order the chick-fil-a  chicken and chick-n-strips. The price was also affordable. The waitresses & waiters were fast and friendly. I really loved the christmas decoration, so beautiful. One of the fastest Chick A Filet I ever visited, the Director expedited all customer orders.  All the servers helped retrieve the orders from the kitchen and in the dinning area, the worker: Christian kept the dinning are very clean and assisted me with a cup of water.  The sandwiches tasty excellent. Amazing chick-fil-a, did not disappoint at all! The chicken deluxe was fresh and tasty, just like how I remember it. The waffle fries are great, and of course the signature sauce is delicious. On top of that, great service and they take your order while queuing. I have never seen such a well run restaurant.  They are quick and efficient.  The prices are not reasonable anymore but that is to be expected anywhere in Boston.  We decided to eat upstairs and the staff member upstairs was super friendly and courteous. The first time I dine in, and one item that caught my attention was the fresh flowers on the tables!\nChicken sandwich and fries are delicious as usual! You can see the picture! Decided to try Capital burger for the first time based on the reviews! Let me start by saying I am a burger lover and was quickly disappointed. I\u2019ll start by saying the actually burger meat had zero flavor, I had to put salt to give it some sort of flavor which was strange because for the amount of cheese and onions it had I thought that would at least pop but not even that! Now the truffle fries were absolute perfection so flavorful, not greasy and crispy just how I like! The pickles were a nice addition too. And the wings were okay nothing out of the ordinary. Would I come back most likely not but it was worth trying! Great service, waitress attended to all our issues quickly and was very cheerful. Calamari was the best I ever had and I've had it across the world. Burgers were cooked to perfection hitting a perfect medium for my capital burger. 10/10 would recommend! The best burger that I have ever had in my life. The capital burger is a burger that is a French onion soup reconstructed into a burger. Wild mushroom burger was truly amazing with the blend of mushroom and patty. The burgers had patties that had amazing flavor of beef that resembled a very good quality steak. Thanks for amazing food and service which made our Valentine\u2019s day lunch very pleasant! Service was very good, and atmosphere is very nice. But, food is overpriced for what it is and its quality of flavors. The capital burger, fried chicken sandwich l and bacon cheeseburger left us underwhelmed. The bacon was good, but cheese had no flavor and the meat didn't standout. Fries were good, but at this price, charging $4 extra for Gouda fries (and making the portion smaller) was disappointing. Definitely come for the atmosphere or service, not the titular 'burger' offered here. Best burger I've had in a long time. Given that Burger is in their name, they sure know how to cook a burger to perfection. I ordered medium rare ant that's exactly the way it came. Plus, the place has great vibes and a beautiful view of Newbury Street. Best gluten free pizza I've ever had!! The crust was a perfect texture and even had a tad of yeast flavor, making it feel more authentic. We split 4 pizzas amongst 5 people and it was the right amount of food. My favorite was the truffle, and we also had the Bianca, pesto, and artichoke. The waitress was an interesting character but we had good service nonetheless. We didn't realize they only take reservations, but the restaurant was empty when we walked in so I think they made an exception. Overall just an amazing vegan and gluten free restaurant that was much more artisanal than a typical pizza pub. Giving 1 star for vibe and ambiance.\nAnd 1 star for service.\n\nMusic was a bit too loud, it was hard to hear each other. Design and atmosphere were nice as well as the service.\n\nFood was terrible. Definitely worst vegan restaurant I\u2019ve been to. We\u2019ve ordered Cesar salad and Pepperoni, both were disappointing.\nPizza wasn\u2019t cut and it was hard to eat, dough was so soft that it was impossible to hold a slice. The \u201cpepperoni\u201d was crunchy and flaky, it was falling of the pizza. Tasted terrible too. On top of that it had a sweet syrup on top, which was a bit confusing to my taste.\n\nOn of the worst dinners that I had, sorry.\nDo not recommend. The staff were very friendly and clearly working hard. It was possible for us to get a table on a Saturday night at 7pm without a reservation. This restaurant sells vegan food only. The restaurant appeared understaffed with two cooks doing everything and two hosts/waitstaff for the whole restaurant. Double zero was out of several things like the truffle pizza and cacio pepe on their menu. All of the pizzas and calzones were soggy. The imitation meat products did not closely represent meat. The eggplant parm was good but somewhat burned. It took us a very long time to get water. It might be worth going back if with vegans or if the restaurant is able to fully staff in the future. We absolutely loved our dinner, the Cabernet and the desserts!!  We ordered the meatball calzone and the artichoke pizza.  Both meals were outstanding.  The Cabernet was silky smooth and the bottle was the perfect amount for the two of us to enjoy with dinner and desert.  We ordered both desserts on the menu and they didn\u2019t disappoint.  Everything was delicious.  The only small issue was the seating.  There were long tables and we sat across from each other and right next to strangers.  We prefer a bit more personal space. It was my first vegan pizza in Boston. Being from Europe, the Double Zero crust has an almost perfect flavor of an Italian pizza. The place has a nice, a bit hipstery vibe, and while we were there the only thing odd was that they were blasting 80's hits a bit too loud for our taste, but other than that the ambience is really cozy and perfect for a quick sitdown with friends for some wine and pizza.\nWe chose two different pizzas - artichoke and truffle. While artichoke was fantastic - the freshness of the ingredients with just right amount of sweetness and saltiness, the truffle we found to be a bit bland. It still tasted good, but definitely could be elevated. Overall - a tasty and recommendable find on otherwise pretty pricey Newbury St. We have dined here for both brunches and dinners. The most recent couple of brunch meals were disappointing so we now come only for dinner, which is still consistently very good. We love the squash carpaccio, meatballs, veal Milanese, lobster salad and pizzas. Service is always very good and efficient.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and has a great relaxing vibe, a great setting for enjoying good food and conversations. The only complaint that we have is that the desserts are a bit simple and boring. We are happy though that we can always count on a good meal for dinner. Located atop the prestigious five-star Newbury Hotel, this Italian restaurant boasts an unbeatable location with breathtaking 360-degree views of the city. The interior is thoughtfully designed, featuring a sophisticated vintage aesthetic that adds to its elegant ambiance. Every detail, from the furniture to the d\u00e9cor, reflects a refined sense of style.\n\nWhile the atmosphere is exceptional, the food itself did not fully meet our expectations. We sampled a variety of dishes to explore the menu\u2019s range, but the flavors did not quite justify the high price point. However, the stunning setting and vibrant ambiance created an uplifting experience, making it a great spot to start the day on a high note. A very nice rooftop restaurant. It has an amazing view on Boston and very good food, especially the French toast and the Fresh Baked Cornetto. However, the service can be a bit disappointing.\nFirstly, one of the hostesses doesn\u2019t show any enthusiasm to when people enter and doesn\u2019t even smile.\nSecondly, we were quite annoyingly scammed as the waiter told us \u2018it\u2019s not the water we charge for; it\u2019s the service\u2019. That added 10 dollars per person. Please ask for complimentary tap water instead! However, the other waiters which we had were very kind and attentive. A huge shoutout to them! I had such a wonderful experience here! The views are absolutely stunning, and the ambience is elegant and inviting. It\u2019s definitely a hard place to snag reservations at, but it\u2019s worth the effort.\n\nEverything I tried was delicious\u2014the squash carpaccio was light and refreshing, and the spicy lobster capellini was a standout. It had a real kick of spice, and the flavors were so rich and addicting. And don\u2019t even get me started on the desserts\u2014I was completely obsessed! The tiramisu, in particular, was perfection.\n\nOverall, it was an unforgettable dining experience, and I can\u2019t wait to go back! Celebrating New Year\u2019s Eve at Contessa was an experience filled with highs and lows that left us with mixed feelings. We booked in advance, anticipating a set menu that was not cheap but promised a luxurious dining experience. Upon arrival, the ambiance was undeniably beautiful, with an elegant setting that matched the festive occasion.\n\nOur evening started on a disappointing note when we were informed that they had run out of caviar for the burrata dish we ordered. Although they offered a truffle alternative, it didn\u2019t quite hit the mark for us, especially considering the expectations set by the menu\u2019s description. This minor setback was compounded by the uncomfortably cold temperature in the dining area, which forced us to dine in our coats, somewhat diminishing the elegance of the evening.\n\nThe wine selection was impressive, offering a wide variety that catered to diverse palates. However, the overall value for the price we paid didn\u2019t seem justifiable, especially with the compromises we had to make, such as eating under a large, awkwardly placed planter that added to our discomfort.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was undoubtedly the DJ, who provided an excellent soundtrack that truly captured the spirit of New Year\u2019s Eve. The music and the lively atmosphere he created were the saving graces of our celebration.\n\nDespite the beautiful decor and the festive ambiance, the combination of service missteps, seating discomfort, and the chill in the dining room led us to decide not to recommend Contessa for future New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations. While the night had its moments, the overall experience didn\u2019t live up to the expectations, leaving us to consider other venues for our next big celebration. Small cozy coffee shop at the fancy Newbury street.  You can savour the quality of coffee in the first sip.  The service is awesome and the ham and cheese croissant as well.\n\nPeople may think it\u2019s pricey but the quality of ingredients is high. So you pay for what you get.\n\nThere is a bathroom for customers only. Blue Bottle Coffee on Newbury Street is an absolute gem! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The minimalist, cozy vibe made it the perfect spot to relax. I tried their pour-over, and it was hands down one of the best cups of coffee I\u2019ve ever had. You can really taste the freshness and care that goes into every brew. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, making the experience even better. If you\u2019re a coffee lover or just enjoy finding new places, I highly recommend stopping by! 5 stars all the way! \u2615\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1f I do like BB, with consistent quality pour over. And yes, I\u2019m totally willing to wait like 3 min. I\u2019d wait longer. If it made a difference. In terms of 3rd wave, I\u2019d place it near the bottom, on its way possible to be a bland mega-chain. Coffee overall is like a 6, but that\u2019s pretty darn good, compared to big box batch brew places. Just having more variety would make a big difference - more options for beans, especially lighter roasts and natural process beans. I would like to see more food options too (esp GF). Ambiance/music - I love the 90s grunge and other 90s throwbacks. OK friendliness. For all the coffee lovers out there, this coffee is absolutely delicious! While it might be slightly pricier than competitors like Starbucks, Thinking Cup, or Caff\u00e8 Nero, it\u2019s hands-down my favorite. The flavor is everything to me, and this coffee delivers\u2014its rich aroma, smooth texture, and robust strength are truly amazing!\n\nThe atmosphere here is just as great as the coffee. Ryan, the manager, sets a warm and welcoming tone that resonates throughout the team. The positive vibes make every visit a pleasure.\n\nI can\u2019t recommend this place enough\u2014it\u2019s worth every penny! Fantastic coffee. I would highly recommend committing to the fact that if you want coffee here it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. So go in knowing that. It\u2019s typical for a busy city location. The staff did a great job with getting our order together. There was a lot of people and it took about 10-15 minutes. So not bad at all. Really great atmosphere and there is a lot of people using the space to do school work in. I would recommend grabbing a drink and going. Enjoy the city, walk around, and enjoy your coffee.\n\nCheck out my photos to get a sense of the space. There are eight working treadmills here - which are all over 20 years old. Another dozen have been sitting there FOR OVER A YEAR with signs saying \"we are working on this\" but no repair activity ever seen. Lines of folks waiting every day for those who like to scroll on phones while they walk for an hour. Absolutely ridiculous. Another pet peeve is the custodian mops the entire locker room and showers every weekday at 5pm the very busiest time - really?? Tons of machines are broken and they don\u2019t fix them. About half the treadmills are broken and don\u2019t work.\nAlso they have screaming kids here a lot of the time. Why are children at a gym you might ask? So they can ruin the pool.\nDo better. This is a bad gym. I only go there because it is the closest to my house. The machines are rusty, the locker rooms are always dirty, the towels are small and washed out, the showers are very dirty, there is not always hot water, there are some insects and mold, the pool is rusty, the sauna is cold. Update 4.20.2021- BSC added an option from their APP that is awesome! One can book a time for a swimming lane reservation 'Pool Reservation' and proceed up to 2 weeks in advance. In addition, if one needs to cancel because of a personal or professional schedule change, there is also the option to do so, freeing that time frame for other Member to use the time to make his or her Pool Reservation. Click on Find a Class and it will take you to Pool Reservation!\n\nWhen the Club reopened, I went to visit at the end of August 2020 to see what measures were taken to ensure the safety of the Members who wanted to go back to the Gym or the pool. I liked the automatic take of each member's frontal temperature, the questions asked at the desk and the obligation to wear a mask while in the premises. I went back the next day to swim at the pool and have been 5 x week since. I feel very comfortable and safe in this location with the pool restrictions and the very frequent cleaning of the pool & the locker area and, as I noticed, in the gym area as well. Thumbs up to BSC Boylston for having put that in place and for keeping it safe that way. In addition the team working there has always been very welcoming. Gerard Riveron\nsince my last review, the Club has successfully put in place a reservation rule to swim. One can just call a day before of stop by the desk to reserve a swimming lane for a 30 minutes swim at a specific time. This allows to enforce the limitation of 3 swimmers only at the same time in the pool area, each in his or her own swimming lane. Bravo ! Well, the staff are friendly and the gym is sufficiently equipped. However, this location cannot handle the new volume of customers induced by the closure of the Prudential Center location at the beginning of January. The gym is very busy at all hours, and management has not taken steps to add basic equipment, such as benches. I used to enjoy this space, but if you are new to the area and searching for a gym, I recommend looking elsewhere. Filthiest yoga studio I have ever practiced in. The classes are fine. I love that they offer yoga sculpt which gets my strength training and cardio in one hour....but OMG....the hygiene is seriously a problem. I am sure there violating all kinds of sanitation codes. I seriously worry about catching some kind of fungus or bacteria every time I step into the changing room.\n\nFor the price I pay here for a monthly membership....I honestly expected better. Very disappointed.\n\nOn top of the filthy studio....beware that classes are randomly cancelled. I signed up because I loved the various times they offered class. I am a very busy professional and usually plan out my week ahead of time and add my yoga classes to my calendar at the start of the week. Many times cancels are simply cancelled.\n\nVery disappointed. Do not recommend. I really wanted to love it, but unless there is improvement on cleanliness and random cancellation of classes will need to rethink giving them my business. After being caught in an unexpected meeting at work I was denied entry after showing up at 12:02pm for a 12:00pm class.  Be careful with this studio if you're a working professional that may not always have the flexibility to show up 15 minutes ahead of schedule.\n\nEdit:   Adding this after receiving the response from the owner.  Your yoga studio is literally the only one I've been to that won't allow it's members to be a minute late before shutting them out.  Your classes aren't nearly full enough to be turning away potential customers with a policy like that. Had an excellent experience at corepower back bay! Amy\u2019s playlist was incredible! Her instructions are clear and she offered modifications to meet the level of fitness I desired. This studio rocks, my favorite is Nicole R. sculpt on Thursday nights, perfect temperature and a great balance of motivational while also being challenging. Cannot recommend enough. Def take her class. Only thing I sometimes dont like is that the studio is in the basement so no windows and sometimes like fenway studio better since its street level w big windows Bella F is the best instructor EVER!! it was a great workout and so much fun. I highly recommend taking her class!!! Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!!

Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. The restaurant is designed in a Lolita-inspired style and is housed in a historic building, creating a unique and cohesive aesthetic. The attention to detail in the d\u00e9cor enhances the overall dining experience. Service is excellent, with dishes served promptly. The food is authentic and expertly seasoned. I ordered nearly all of the restaurant\u2019s signature tacos, and each one delivered an amazing taste. Dark theme but lively vibes inside. Tapas style plates were delicious. I will warn the carne assada even though it was very good is an extremely small dish with just meat and sauce. Drinks were so tasty as well. Would definitely go back again Absolutely eat here. We were visiting for a few nights and always look for unique places to eat when we travel, this did not disappoint. The atmosphere is cozy, exceptional staff and the food and drinks were beyond our expectations. It's a great experience. We have been planning to visit it for sometime and we finally got a chance today.\nWe went for lunch with an appointment which I highly recommend to get before walking in. We got seated immediately.\nAmbience is amazing, with little darker tone of colors. It was valentine's Day and skull with roses was a nice touch.\nWe started with drinks, I had broken heart, with others ordering mojito and one mocktail. Drinks were good with nice presentation.\nWe had lobster roll, ribs and veggie burger. We ordered lettuce shrimp for appetizers. It was very good. Main course was also delicious with good portion size.\nWe had tres leches in dessert, it was finished very quickly among three of us.\nService was good, and parking is road parking in front.\nOverall a great experience and a must visit place in Boston. A great place for tacos and other tapas with a unique atmosphere. We made a reservation online and we were seated right away. The appetizers were all great which included the trio of guacamole, calamari, corn bread, and Mexican street corn which was my favorite. My mojito unfortunately was not good. No mint at all and tasted nothing like a traditional mojito. A nice free cotton candy treat at the end was a fun touch. I would recommend if you're in the area! I was not looking for dinner \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f but I was becoming hungry. I walked past the window \ud83e\ude9f seats of this restaurant and the food looked good! After walking Newbury Street, I decided to try here. Expecting a window seat \ud83e\ude91, which to me is great \ud83d\udc4d, I was taken downstairs to a comfortable booth to my surprise \ud83e\udee2.\nI had multiple servers and all of them were great! I had the Chicken Piccata with complimentary fresh bread \ud83c\udf5e and butter. Yummy \ud83d\ude0b!\nClassic rock \ud83e\udea8 played at a quiet level \ud83c\udf9a\ufe0f. The overhead lights dimmed a bit as the sun \u2600\ufe0f set.  The bathroom was in good shape. I used to run janitorial crews so I cannot help but notice.\nI had a better time than I expected! Prices are typical of running a business in Boston. You are a \ud83e\udea8 stones, not Rolling, throw from the Commonwealth Avenue Mall if you want to walk off a few calories.\nI recommend a visit! From the girls that seated me to my waitress Anna was top notch. If you wanna eat good n feel good come here. I don\u2019t have 215k views for nothing. Amazing place amazing people amazing food. Joe\u2019s actually really surprised me. My sister and I kicked it off with a round of espresso martinis which were great. My brother got coffee which they pour straight from a nice little pot.\n\nI got the classic American breakfast which was delicious. The sausages were flavorful and the potatoes were perfectly cooked + seasoned. The eggs were very basic but that seems to be the norm at breakfast places these days. I stole bacon from my dad and it was great as well. Lastly, they have a gluten free toast option which was way better than I expected. Reservations for dinner on a weekend trip to Cambridge. Busy place! Service was okay. Thankfully the chef took my wife's food allergy seriously because it felt like the server blew it off but then she was back after the chef had more questions. Food was very good. Instead of dinner we got a bunch of apps and sides. Starter bread was fantastic. Place was pretty cool, only wish it was less family friendly because some parents were not controlling their children. Very good bourbon sour. Me, my husband and friend ate here for the first time, made a reservation the night of and had no problem getting in. All the food was really good. I had the cheeseburger egg rolls, meatloaf and my husband got a burger. My friend hot the chicken pot pie. Overall it was a good priced menu with good options to choose from."

    "reviews": "Very recommended. They do a great job and the service is excellent. Stanhope, as an artist, is first off affordable. Otherwise they are super smart and have an amazing eye, the quality is as good as it gets and the experience a pleasure. Their van driver is insanely aggressive. Probably shouldn\u2019t cut people off while driving the company van. Excellent framing shop. The prices are outrageous, even for the area. About 15$ per load because the big machines are the only ones usable, the small ones are extremely tiny. They close very early so there is a small window of time to do laundry, and I came right before they were supposed to close to pick up my clothes, only to find that they decided to be lazy and leave a little bit early, so now all my clothes are going to be wrinkly. Avoid this place at all costs. They increased the price??! It is now $6.50 for one load on the washers. The issue is these washers are so tiny they are basically unusable, so I have been forced into using the bigger \u201cCommercial Washer\u201d which has increased to $8.75 a load. Then $.25 for 4 minutes on the dryer. When all is said and done, ONE LOAD OF LAUNDRY can end up costing me $12-$15(Depending on size and how long it takes to dry). Theres been weeks where I have do a load of clothes and a load of towels/sheets it ends up costing me up to $30 in ALL quarters. They know their customer base, they know apartments next to/nearby them do not install laundry machines because the laundromat is so close. The whole \u201cThis is what it costs in back-bay\u201d, is also wrong, if you can carry your clothes to Pinos on Westland you\u2019ll save much more money. Really aggravating that they prey on the students who have no other options and inflate the price to ridiculous levels. A load of laundry a week and I\u2019m easily spending $50 on laundry a month, $600 a year on LAUNDRY in only quarters. If you\u2019re open until 6pm, I expect to be able to pick my clothes up by then without walking up to find the doors are locked and to be told \u201csorry, we already set the alarm.\u201d I have a skin condition and get out of work just in time to be able to do laundry. Thank you for making something else even more difficult than it already is. I don\u2019t understand why people are complaining. Like to have a place to do laundry as expensive as back bay, they would obviously need to price it that much. And the people that work their are super sweet and kind. They always have change. It\u2019s so easy you just leave your things and come back in 20 min. Machines also work great. Gets a the job done but could use some cleaning. You are better off if you use the bigger machines for $6.50 or $5.75 for a huge load! The normal ones are a rip off for $4.75 compared how small load they wash. Drying i 25cents/4 minutes. I took classes here 30 years ago and have owned a successful full service florist for over 23 years.  Highly recommend!!! Excellent quality, focus on freshness -- delicious noodles! We live around the corner and we were happy to see that Chef Chang's reopened. We decided to eat in, as the restaurant has a clean, cozy feeling. The host was prompt and helpful. I am a vegetarian and ordered the #1 Xi'an Hand-pulled BiangBiang noodles. My husband got the #2, which has pork. We both ordered spicy and we loved these dishes. Very filling and healthy. They are steamed, not fried. The other customers were Chinese and seemed extremely happy with the food as well. We will definitely be back. Posting photos of the menu and hours. FYI, the host said they may be changing their name to focus on the noodles. We will definitely be back. I went to Chef Chang\u2019s once three years ago and I haven\u2019t been able to catch them open ever since. The eggplant dish is legendary. Showing my support with this review while I patiently wait for them to reopen. Please\u2026 \ud83d\ude4f other people say it is authentic. maybe so, i have no idea, but it is certainly not the same old, same old, and it is definitely delicious. pricier than most, true, but they are super friendly. both our dishes were exceedingly salty which usually i take to be a bad sign, but in this case i wonder if that's simply the style. the eggplant (as others have said)  is spectacular. the chicken dish was made with lots of that weird sichuan pepper that makes your mouth numb. i liked it very much. will definitely go again. just be prepared to hydrate heavily the next couple of days. I'm basing my review off of the fact that I wasn't even able to try this restaurant. I came here on a Friday evening for dinner with a friend. I called the day before, which was a Thursday, and was told that they would be open on Friday. But unfortunately when we arrived they were closed. Even the sign on the door showing the opening and closing times said that they were supposed to be open. There was no notice on the door that explain why they were closed or for how long. This really ruined my experience considering my friend and I were really looking forward to trying this restaurant and went out of the way to go here. It is really unprofessional that a restaurant would say that they would be open and then close unexpectedly with no notice. I understand that there can be emergencies but the least they could have done was put a note on the door explaining why they were closed and for how long. I would go back to try this place because of all the positive reviews that I read but I don't know when they're going to be open again. We ordered food and picked it up. The food was really good, the spicy is actually spicy. A bit pricey. Not all dishes come with rice *if it does not say it comes with rice assume it does not.* I will be trying again , looking forward to eating in the restaurant next time. Newman is a great school! Graduating from Newman I was well prepared for College and beyond. The faculty and staff go above and beyond to meet the needs of students as individuals. Good school good teacher love it great school"

    "reviews": "A really nice park with an interesting monument in it. This is a pleasant place to walk through and appreciate the outdoors. nice park with lots of dogs\nnice benches to take some rest before heading to the monument Cool park along the freedom Trail, packed with lots of history about the battles and losses here, Def worth the quick stop We walked to get to the USS Constitution and found this park in full Christmas swing in first week of December. The park had stands selling small jewelry, flowers, toys, horse rides and a Christmas pen for children. Even a small petting pen with goats, rabbits and wild hens. Excellent event. Super cool Halloween Town event going on. Was pleasantly surprised!!! Great customer service! Love the personal care received by the staff. Especially Jack. They made my concern, my project their own. Missed that quality level of customer service. I highly recommend them. Even for online orders for the Boston area. Shop locally I\u2019ve been here to copy keys and buy paint a few times, and the people are incredibly helpful. It feels like a friendly neighbor lending a hand, which I really appreciate! Special thanks to Chase and the gentleman with long hair - both were super helpful and patient in explaining the different paint finishes and tools when I'm only buying a quart of paint. It\u2019s a place that feels nostalgic and familiar, like a neighborhood shop where the friendly owner knows your family. They even have a cat named Indy who watches the store at night for them\ud83d\ude06. Love here. There's a cat. She's very polite. That's all you need to know. I love you beautiful meow meow. Charles Street Supply is a reliable hardware store with a wide range of tools and materials. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, always ready to assist. I've bought small items, an outdoor furniture set, and now some yeti bottles... No issue until the yeti bottles.\n\nOnline order\u2014I was packed an 18oz rambler bottle with the chug cap instead of the hotshot cap, so I called and went in to exchange it. It wasn't until I was about to leave that an older gentleman asked me in an accusatory tone, \"Did you order the wrong item, or did we pack it wrong?\". I'm thinking why does it matter at this point? You can also ask your employees who I've spoken to already in private.\n\nOtherwise you'd just frame as, \"Did we pack your item correctly?\" And leave it at that if you really needed to know.\n\nI didn't appreciate this interaction where I had to justify myself. Unfortunate this happened. Beacon Hill Wine & Spirits is in my opinion the go to packie on the hill to buy your booze  And this is coming from a professional chef and former bartender, as well as lifelong Beacon Hill resident.\n\nThe proprietors, Dominic and Chris, are not only cordial, helpful, and respectful, but additionally are both extremely knowledgeable regarding the trade,  I have found their knowledge of wine and cider (my choice:  Down East) , and tequilas and whiskeys, to be most helpful In refining, my taste over the years.\n\nWhile Beacon Hill has lots of options to purchase your alcohol, those in the know shop nowhere but here. Jack recently participated in our Women's Wellness night and brought with him a great selection of wines.   He was very knowledgeable and was a pleasure to work with.   Thank you Jack. Great staff, friendly chat, and tight but solid bourbon selection. Three stars are for the selection of their tequila but minus the two stars for the price gouging that they do . I bought the same exact bottle of tequila for $30 cheaper literally down the street at Delucas . I could understand $5-10 but $30 is highway robbery . Cool space. And one of the few places I\u2019ve been that actually had a bottle or two of every champagne they carry chilled too. This is the last of the old independent neighbourhood drug stores around Boston with history. If you need something hard to fine, they will try to get it for you.!! I rented two wheel chairs from here for graduation. The staff were so helpful. Everything was as ordered, they showed me how to use the chairs and took them back so quickly I managed to hop back into my Uber to carry on my trip. Highly recommend! My favorite local drug store = A tiny store that has every single thing you could possibly ask for. Wonderful service with people like Gail who always make you feel welcome. Neighborhood treasure! Superior to all other pharmacies and Rx prices are much cheaper. The quintessential neighborhood healthcare product provider. Exceptional service. I can't say enough great things about Lauren and her brow lamination services! From the moment I walked in, she made me feel so comfortable. The results are beyond amazing\u2014my brows look perfectly sculpted and full, without being too overdone. Lauren is a true professional, and it's clear she really cares about her clients and their desired results. I've received so many compliments on my brows, and I can't stop staring at them in the mirror! If you're looking to elevate your brow game, Lauren is the absolute best. Highly recommend! I had pretty low expectations bc I walked home from here in the middle of an actual typhoon fresh off a spray tan but MY GOODNESS. As the palest person I know, I\u2019ve gotten a good bit of spray tans and this one was quite literally flawless. My legs are STILL (almost a week later) perfect. The tan faded evenly as well which is rare. The woman (can\u2019t remember her name) made me feel very comfortable despite me being a nervous wreck and I would DEFINITELY go back. If you're looking to get your eyebrows tinted, shaped and waxed... highly recommend Lauren. I'll definitely be back, that girl knows what she's doing! My brows never looked better! Aliyah M is the best! I was very nervous for anyone to touch my brows but knew I needed help shaping them. I went to her initially for a brow tweeze and she was very friendly and explained what she was doing. She did a great job of cleaning them up but I still felt like I looked like myself. I went back for a wax the second time and plan to come back for waxes every month. Thank you!! Amazing wax and tint with Lauren! She is extremely professional and accommodating, and my brows came out amazing! I never trust anyone with my brows but I will definitely be back! Amazing customer service. Store is very clean with a lot of options. I will definitely go back and highly recommend this location. While we all loved Core de Vie when it was on Charles Street it has been closed since the winter of 2020 despite what the Google listing says. I am the co-owner of the new business now located at 40 Charles Street ~ Blackstone's of Beacon Hill After two weeks of feeling pain in my shoulders, I finally made an appointment for a deep tissue massage.\nWhen I got to the counter I was introduced to Jason, my masseur.\nHe explained everything clearly and patently, and answered all of my questions. I left feeling very relaxed, with far less tension/pain in my shoulders.\nOverall a great experience! I recommend this place to anyone who is experiencing pain or tension. Great high quality fast service! I bought in a  stinky wool peacoat after getting quotes from other dry cleaners in the area. Even though Anton\u2019s prices are higher than competitors, I trusted the price would reflect a high quality of work. My coat was ready the following day (so fast!) and I ended up picking it up a few days later. They got the smell out perfectly! Definitely would recommend. Well worth the value. The staff are helpful making sure that all the particulars of an alteration or cleaning are noted, the articles of clothing always come back beautifully tailored and/or laundered, and the staff clearly enjoy interacting with the customers. Used 2 times. Both times clothes is returned with same spots/dirt, so not really cleaning - just removing odors pretty much. This time they returned my blazer ripped at the collar - how can this even happen? Great experience at Anton\u2019s Cleaners. They took great care of a very expensive scarf and the staff is friendly and efficient. Would definitely recommend! DO NOT dry clean your Canada Goose jacket here! Mine shrunk (style name\u2019s Mystic), it went from ankle length to mid calf, same thing happened to the sleeves!! Ahhh\u2026I discovered \u2018December Thieves\u2019 the day before Christmas in 2024. And what a holiday present.\n\nThis funky, upscale shop on Charles Street in Boston is decked out with every thing from clothes + jewelry to artsy home decor. (I happened to find a new line of Bakelite type jewelry I was enchanted with.)\n\nIt\u2019s a chic, unique + friendly place full of treasures AND they\u2019re online as well. (I just placed an order + it arrived just over 24 hours later, packaged beautifully with a wee bag of jelly beans on top!)\n\nSO\u2026just GO! You\u2019ll be delighted you made them a shopping priority. I love December Thieves! I have been shopping online and have been thrilled with all my purchases. They have a unique selection of pieces from an assortment of designers and reasonably priced for exceptional quality.\nI have never had a problem with delivery. I highly recommend shopping with them. December Thieves is an absolute gem of a store -- but what makes it truly unique and wonderful for me are the private shopping appointments.\n\nWhile I love beautiful things -- jewelry, fabrics, clothes  -- I have a very difficult time shopping for clothes for myself. I have spent too many years trying to make myself fit into images created by fast fashion brands and finally realized that I couldn't do that anymore.\n\nI had shopped at December Thieves before and found pieces that I loved -- so when I saw that I could book an hour to explore what clothing would make me feel most like myself -- most magical -- when I wear it, I decided to go for it.\n\nIf you are considering a shopping appointment -- please do it. If something didn't work for me, I just set it aside until I found something that made me feel amazing (that ended up being two blouses and a dramatic split skirt). The team at December Thieves was so skilled in making sure the experience was positive and was totally invested in making it about what I loved and what felt good on me. I am so truly thankful for that.\n\nI have worn the outfits I bought in September multiple times now and every time I wear them I feel powerful and magical! I hope the same for everyone! December Thieves is that rare find of beauty, artistry, and excellence. I wish I had discovered them decades ago. The owner, Lana\u2019s, curation and brilliant entrepreneurship reveals itself in her keenly vetted selections, high quality craftsmanship, and utterly unique designs, all while beautifully supporting emerging and exciting new designers while deeply supporting her community. Her staff, composed of Jemesii and Brick, are a pure delight, deeply knowledgeable, and simply wonderful human beings.\n\nDecember Thieves goes above and beyond other boutiques with their gorgeous photography, videography, highly detailed product descriptions, and inclusion of fascinating designer bios all at an extremely reasonable price-point and generous shipping policy. I cherish my growing collection and know I will enjoy these treasures for decades. Lucky lucky you if you score one of their offerings, for their small-batch artisan approach means these gems get snatched up quickly. Enjoy! My daughters and I traveled to Boston from Alabama on our way to Martha\u2019s Vineyard. The XV Beacon where we stayed offered car service so we had them drop us off on Charles Street (our driver\u2019s suggestion!). We set out going in and out of all the cute shops but we were awestruck by December Thieves windows! So we went in to shop and did not leave empty-handed! It would be impossible to! Their designers are so forward, all the pieces are beautiful and unique. Great shoes, great jewelry and fun and funky accessories (a lacquered tray is next on my purchase list). I bought a long flowy black dress by a Russian designer that is out of this world fabulous! I can hardly wait to wear it. The sister store is as wonderful-the home goods and accessories are way a cut above your typical gift shop. My daughter bought a straw backpack tote with leather straps that is lightweight and great looking on. I bought several fragrances and a wonderful travel size lavender hand sanitizer. YOU MUST have something gift wrapped too. Another cut above! So glad I can continue shopping these two stores online! I wish I had taken a photo of the windows-you must see for yourself though! So go!!!!! Was not impressed with this particular branch. Made an appointment with Ana B. at 11:30 to open a business checking account. After having me wait for 15 minutes she told me I needed to \u201cemail her documents\u201d and then come back the following day. I got the impression she was busy and didn\u2019t want to deal with me. Total waste of time. Poor customer service\nA customer went here today asking for her account and routing number (void check or bank statement) for a direct deposit of her tax refunds. Since she has no fluent in English, She had a paper saying \u201cno handwriting information\u201d. She has her MA ID and checking card.\n\nThey refused to print this information (void check of bank statement) and they wrote the information on a piece of paper.\n\nI went back with her a few minutes after before closing; they refused to speak with us or let us in. Santander Bank Good for me and people\nThank you for your bank I like \u270c\ufe0f Greatest Everything is overpriced. A 12-pack of Ginger Ale was $21. I asked the cashier if that was correct\u2026 She gave me a look and said it was correct. I put it back and grabbed one for under $10 nearby \ud83d\ude43 I understand location and challenges of a small business but this market is not worth it!  Evaluation is based on a few visits. They\u2019re overpriced for lack of quality,  poor customer service and expired products.  There\u2019s a similar market down the street that is 10 times better! Great local market, popular brands * surprisingly broad selection.  Fresh produce and dairy too.  Full serve deli esp. sandwiches.  Incredibly hardworking and dedicated team, friendly and always helpful.  Good prices, unbeatable neighborhood convenience! Love Beacon Hill Market! Expensive, but that\u2019s to be expected from a convenience store. Most of the food I bought was actually well past its expiration date. $40 for a few essentials and they\u2019re no longer good? Yikes. Thankfully no one in my family got sick! Had what i needed but the prices are outrageous. Most prices are not listed on or near items either so you don't know what you're getting into until you get to the register. I bought a pack of oscar meyer hot dogs today, and was charged $8! When i saw the cashier enter the price I asked, are these hot dog $8? and I was told the price was per hot dog.... for a sealed pack of oscar meyer hot dogs... This place is managed horribly. They raise the prices of the wash very frequently. The large load right now is 11 dollars (!) and the SMALL load is 5.50. This is way above what I have encountered in all the other washing machines I have used in the city. Apart from that most of the small machines are incredibly dirty and poorly managed. The place advertises that they get cleaned every two weeks but every time we go there it is grimy and has trash lying around. Avoid this place at all costs. I didn\u2019t have any problems using the credit/debt card machine, but it didn\u2019t go through until the second attempt.\n\nThe smell that people have mentioned in other reviews isn\u2019t something I personally noticed, but I did bring extra baking soda and vinegar to wash my clothes after a day of thrifting and also to rinse off any smells from the machine. You can purchase both at Dollar Tree.\n\nIt\u2019s $5.50 for a small washer and $2.50 for a dryer, totaling $8, but I\u2019ve gone to very good laundromats that charged $7 for a small washer and dryer, so I don\u2019t mind the price.\n\nFree Wi-Fi!\n\nThey use fans to cool down the laundromat, not A/C.\n\nThere\u2019s a machine to change bills into coins, but it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAlso a good place for travelers. There\u2019s an outlet potentially for charging phones. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be there still once I post this. Had to play shuffle washers to find ones that worked with card, none of the dryers worked without quarters.  No answer when you call the number, not a good way to do business.  If you plan to come, bring quarters or you will be bringing wet clothes home The machines accept credit cards. We only used the dryers, but they worked well. It was easy to find available machines. There is a park within walking distance, which is a nice place to wait. There are also chairs and folding tables in the laundromat. Coin machines work. They offer a variety of products for washers and dryers. Many machines as well as free wifi. Only gripe is the card reader wasn't working for me but since the coin machine was, there wasn't an issue. An ATM is also available as needed. Definitely the best laundromat in east Cambridge The distinctive style of J. McLaughlin is very beautiful displayed at this store. Helpful staff as well. Great selection of casual and dressing clothing for many occasions and friendly and helpful customer service in the store and online! Great store, wonderful personal service. Love this shop in Boston. Great service and their quality is great Friendly service and beautiful clothes. I took a trip to find this store. It was a wonderful experience. I bought a small set of rosewood beads and a back issue of Trixycle magazine. The shop has a nice selection of small figurines, various pouches, and a lot of fabric items. There is a small selection of books I haven\u2019t seen elsewhere, and many magazines 50% off the cover price. It was nice chatting with the kind owner. Please drop by and show this small shop some love. The Tibetan Emporium  is a small boutique in the Beacon Hill area, a short walk from Boston Commons Park. It's located on the same side and a few doors from the Covet. It offers jewelry, full size silk scarves, table cloths, runners, pillow covers etc. Parking can be very limited. The prices are notably reasonable. The service is friendly and welcoming. Visited Tibet Emporium for the first time this weekend while walking down Charles Street and had an amazing experience! The owners were so welcoming, and they had the most unique selection of patterned fabrics, scarves, jewelry and more. I wanted to buy everything, but I settled on a gorgeous blue scarf that is so soft. I cannot wait to visit again and pick up a few more items for the winter. Definitely check it out! At first glance it may look like just a bunch of fast fashion packaged resold goods (read this in a previous review). I have a keen eye for jewelry, as I\u2019m very particular of the silver jewelry I wear. The owner must have hand picked each and every piece and every single one was absolutely beautiful! She was so kind and sweet and helped me pick out the best ring based on my style and what I was looking for. She told me how every piece of jewelry she gets is hand-made and you can definitely tell! This place is relatively new and I love how it has a metaphysical vibe to it. Hard to find those stores in Boston - I usually have to take the T to Braintree to visit a store like this. I\u2019m so happy it\u2019s only about a 5 min walk from my apartment. It\u2019s definitely worth it!! The products they sell here are so cool and unique. If you're looking for something different for a gift (or just for a gift for yourself), then check this place out. They have a nice selection of sterling silver jewelry at reasonable prices. The lady working there was really nice too, although she mentioned that her mom is the one who usually works there. Super nice owner, impeccable quality, this store just can't get any better, got myself a pair of boots and a belt and I just love them Quality products and fair prices. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Not only did I get the exact quality jacket that I wanted, but I learned a thing or two about the history and manufacture of my Schott jacket. Thank you Greg! I will be coming back! I went to Helen's Leather Shop to see if they could refurbish a western belt that my husband bought on a family trip to New Mexico a few decades ago. My husband loved the belt and wore for years until it finally gave out. Greg actually knew the person who created it and arranged for this leather crafter to refurbish it. I gave my husband the belt as a Christmas present and he was so surprised and pleased! Thanks Greg!! First time in Boston, got this amazing little shop recommended by hotel staff. Got me a nice leather jacket, cowboy hat and belt. The quality of craftsmanship is top notch. Greg was such a great host, he explained to me in details about the family owned company that makes jackets and answered all of my questions. Really great and genuine guy! Do not buy anything in Macy's or from those overpriced designers, the quality they have in Hellen's leather is top of the line. I'll come by next year for sure. Solid selection of leather goods from jackets and boots to belts and wallets. I went in looking for cowboy boots and the staff were both so knowledgeable, helpful, and kind. I highly recommend! Had a great experience here! I bought a leather backpack off Etsy for my husband as a gift and within a week, the strap became disconnected. The Designers; Leather Clothiers, Inc fixed it so it's better than how it arrived brand new! Would definitely recommend! Added bonus: They have the best behaved, super cute pup in the office. Dropped off my leather jacket yesterday to have the sleeves shortened. Thanks Dan and Jill for welcoming me and getting my jacket fixed up. I trust that it will look great. I was very impressed with your shop. The Designers did a fantastic job of slimming the back area of a newly-purchased bomber jacket that had too much of a \"ballooning\" effect due to the excess material. I assume this type of alteration is fairly complicated, and the fact that they produce their own leather garments gave extra peace of mind.\n\nI worked with Jill exclusively, and we conducted business almost entirely via email. I live about an hour away, and currently have a broken ankle so driving in wasn't going to be an option. I was able to provide details on the alteration I was looking for, and she was always prompt when getting back to me. I was quoted \"around ten business days\" turnaround time, and the jacket was on my doorstep in eight.\n\nThe quality of the work is outstanding, and the fit is perfect. If you're in need of leather alterations and don't know where to go, I would absolutely recommend The Designers without hesitation. Five stars all the way. Called to ask for help on my current jacket. Jill the owner was so lovely and helpful I preliminary ordered a jacket. The merchant was not open for posted hours for my fitting, thereafter. I flew home, out of the area. The merchant refused to refund the \"purchase\". I have no jacket. None was ever produced. They have my $1510.00. I have nothing. Capital One says they are unable to \"obtain credit from the merchant.\" Capital One says they consider the case closed. COMPLETELY DISREPUTABLE MERCHANT. If they refund my money, I will update my review. Thank you. Good sent such a beautiful birthday gift to my friend with personal touches (which arrived quite quickly, I might add)! I shopped online and added a birthday card with a message in the comments section. They added the message to the card with beautiful type and had the gift wrapped in a pretty box with a bow. They even sent me a thoughtful email of what it looked like before they mailed it. What lovely people and beautiful New England gifts! Good has the most beautiful, curated items. I love that it supports local New England artists and makers! A great source for gifts, exquisite jewelry and textiles \u2014 I always find something I want. It\u2019s quintessentially New England without any of the kitsch! I\u2019ve been a fan of this beautiful store for years. Expertly curated home goods, with the occasional perfectly selected vintage or antique piece as well. The fine jewelry selection is also divine! I never leave without something I love in hand or to add to my wishlist! A lovely neighborhood shop, we always enjoy the unique, curated finds at Good. Paul and his team are incredibly thoughtful in helping you pick out the perfect piece, as well as understand the story behind the product. Thank you, Good! It was a pleasure shopping here, not only because of the high quality selection of niche, beautiful items, but also because of the owner\u2019s charm. There is clearly a lot of passion and heart into the store, and it shows in their products and customer service It really was a wild experience: somebody from the store across the street started a fight and was followed out into the street \ud83d\ude02...\n\nHowever the park was pet friendly and definitely a place to enjoy a good coffee or refreshments. Definitely worth your time to visit Great place very scenic and it is the center of the city, visit it if you get a chance just don\u2019t go 2 blocks west! Great tenant fitness center This was one of the places where The Wire was shot Welcome To One Charles Center Building! This location is now a Nuts Factory store.\n\nWe bought a bunch of goodies a fre days after their opening and, after eating them, learned they sell some wonderful stuff! Soooooo tasty. Will have to go back and buy more. Nut & etc. Each store had difference items.\nWas looking for the stuff dates with sweet cream cheese. Charming street with many shops and resturants.  Wonderful area to walk.  Notice all the gas lite lamp posts.  They are always on.. Absolutely lovely! Was I here? Perfect for finding gifts for friends and family. With a truly eclectic collection of prints available, you're bound to find something interesting every time you're here. Most items are marked down from actual worth so there's always a bargain to be had. This store is fantastic!! The best children\u2019s boutique in Boston. European brands. Great toys for ages newborn to 14Y.\nTwo locations! Beautiful and amazing quality clothes for kids ! If you have the $$ for this shop, you are in luck because the collection is excellently curated. Ulla Johnson,  Whistles, Sea NY, Clare V., Baggu, Loeffler Randall, Lulu Frost... just a really great selection of higher end pieces that are beautiful. Their selections are feminine while urban, stylish but not fussy. Perfect for Boston.\n\nThe shop staff (Jane and Martha) are really friendly, helpful, and nice, too, which is an added bonus. This is now Tatte Caf\u00e9, and it is excellent for breakfast and brunch. Great pastries and Israeli-inspired dishes, such as Shakshuka. The coffee itself was very good. The only downside, the long line of customers, but it went quickly. I love this place for bridal shopping. They have the best collection. Must visit. Looking perfect also products display very well.....\ud83d\udc4c\nGood job guys \ud83d\udc4d That moment you walk into a place and you just know it's going to sell all the things you love. I was greeted as soon \ud83d\udd1c as I walked in. I was curious about this market the last time I visited this street. I observed window seating and thought about getting a drink and warming up inside. I was impressed \ud83d\udc4d when I walked inside.\nFresh fruits\ud83c\udf53 and vegetables, meals to go, healthy food, \ud83e\uddc0 cheeses, basic groceries and a deli that serves hot and cold subs and sandwiches \ud83e\udd6a.\nThe dining area was busy!\nI am not a Bostonian but this is a great place for a movie \ud83c\udfa5 company to come to if they wanted a good representation of a neighborhood store or market. Came for the Tuna Salad sandwich, keep coming back for the Tuna Salad \ud83e\udd6a!\n\nOh, and the pickle! \ud83e\udd52 So joyous am I about the divine pickle that the chef knows me as \u201cpickle girl!\u201d\n\nJust everything about this place is awesome!  Love their selection of every item, including the Iggys bread.  Forget Whole Foods, this is my main grocery squeeze!\n\nDid I mention the pickle? Is this place expensive? Yes. You are in Beacon Hill!  It is to be expected.\nBut, they have a great wine selection. Great location as well. If you\u2019re out dining in Beacon Hill at one of the many restaurants and then realize you need a good bottle of wine or a little bit of produce or that last minute element for your meal at home the next day, this is a great quick stop.\n\nWhen we lived in the Back Bay, we did not do all of our regular \u201cgrocery\u201d shopping here, as it is too expensive to buy the staples here, so we would drive to some of the bigger grocers. But it is a wonderful stop for items you forgot or don\u2019t happen to have in the pantry. Also, great stop for some of the things you can\u2019t find in the larger stores. At one point no one had lingonberry jam, and Delucas did. Again, great wine selection as well! And good deli. Ordered a sandwich and ended up buying three different types of sparkling water because I simply couldn\u2019t decide from their vast selection. The sandwich was huge and delicious, can\u2019t remember the name of it but it had mozzarella pesto tomatoes and prosciutto on sourdough. So good. DeLuca's has been my go-to lunch spot for almost 3 years. Consistent sandwiches and very friendly staff was always a welcomed experience. I could pretty easily justify the $10 sandwich given the beacon hill location and great staff, but charging $15 is just nonsense and can not possibly be justified. Either your suppliers are doing you dirty and you should switch, or you are doing all of your customers dirty and you should be ashamed. One of my favorite stores in Boston. The quality of their sweaters are amazing! This specific location is great, Meghan was very helpful when I came in last and helped me with styling and sizing. Best boutique in Beacon Hill! Gorgeous sweaters and the store manager Meghan and associate Yara were so welcoming and helpful. I'm already looking forward to going back! Very nice Cashmere pieces for every day wear. Good price point. Beware:  once you put on one of their sweaters you won\u2019t want to take it off. Super cute outfits! Best Boutique on Charles Street This is a hidden gem on Charles street in Boston. It is a quaint boutique showcasing a small assortment of the many beautiful pieces they have which can be found on their website. I\u2019m a huge fan of their thong underwear which is perfect for under leggings to avoid the dreaded \ud83d\udc2b Definitely a place you want to discover for yourself or for a gift\n@gailgenslerofficial I purchased custom silk underwear for my fianc\u00e9 and she absolutely raves about them. It\u2019s a great gift and I think women will enjoy the shopping experience as the team in the store is so nice and helpful. I came into the studio with an idea of a Portrait of my rabbits who had passed away. I\u2019m so grateful for Allie who understood what I was going through. Needless to say I had an amazing experience working with the artist Kaitlyn and Allie the owner of Rainbow Pottery for my custom piece! They were both so attentive, understanding, friendly and really brought my vision to life with the beautiful art work! The final product was beyond what I imagined! Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for unique, custom pottery! My kids woke up this morning eager to make me a \u201cfavorite mug,\u201d so I called Rainbows Pottery. The owner was incredibly kind and invited them in to give it a try. From the moment we arrived, both the owner and her daughter were so warm and welcoming, making the kids feel right at home. They were taken straight to the pottery wheel and had a blast creating their mugs. We also learned about their day camp, which sounds amazing, and we\u2019re already looking forward to returning in a few weeks to glaze our mugs and try more fun activities during day camp. The atmosphere was so friendly and drop-in welcoming\u2014my kids are absolutely thrilled and can\u2019t wait to come back! Such a lovely pottery shop! Every piece feels unique and handmade with care. The owner is super friendly and the vibe is warm and inspiring. Can\u2019t wait to come back! I had an amazing time at Rainbows Pottery! I went with my sister to celebrate her birthday, and it was such a nostalgic experience\u2014we used to love painting pottery as kids. It was the perfect, phone-free bonding activity.\n\nThe space is absolutely adorable, and the owner and team are fantastic. Everyone was so welcoming and helpful.\n\nThey had a huge selection of pottery to choose from. My sister and I picked out these cute mugs (huge thanks to the team for helping me with the stripes!). I\u2019ll definitely be back to paint more soon! this studio is gorgeous and all of the staff are so nice and amazing. The owner alli and her family have such great energy and were super encouraging. There\u2019s a wide selection of pieces to choose from, all around a wonderful experience would definitely recommend and definitely go again. I've been bringing theatrical costumes here for the last two years and I am never disappointed! The owner, Farshad, even gave me his personal cell phone number so I can check on the status of costumes. They come back in excellent condition and for such a great price. I highly recommend them, especially if you're in theatre! Evening staff is super nice, prices are good, and they do good work overall. The guy who works the morning shift will give you a lecture if you try to drop off dry cleaning shirts without unbuttoning them first. Just go after 5pm and you'll be fine. Edit 1/21/20 based on the owner's response below.\n\n- I live in Beacon Hill, not California. My profile's out of date I guess. Sorry for the confusion. Still have stains on my clothing.\n\n- It's true, I never noticed the recycling bin. I've updated my review to reflect this green information.\n\n- My wife and I share an account. (Explains why you can't find me) Any issues would be under her name, but if you'd prefer to assume I'm lying, that's fine with me. \ud83e\udd37\n\n- We're also moving, so this isn't really something I'm looking to/need to deal with anymore. Frankly, we've returned multiple times with issues, and at this point I'm not really trying to get anything out of you \u2014 the review just reflects my experience, and folks reading can take it or leave it. But It isn't some plot to get you to buy me new shirts or an undercover review bomb for a neighboring dry cleaner ... I mean, shoot, I didn't even post this to Yelp!\n\nAnyways, thanks for following up & good luck.\n\n-------\n\nOriginal review:\n\nThis place has ruined more clothes than any dry cleaner I\u2019ve been to in my life. Staff was nice, but it doesn\u2019t make up for the quality of service.\n\nI\u2019m talking big black stains that weren\u2019t there, tears, missing buttons etc.\n\nI foolishly kept going back due to how close it was to my apartment, until eventually I realized how much money my fianc\u00e9e and I were blowing replacing ruined clothing.\n\nNot to mention, I\u2019m not sure what the \u201cgreen\u201d bit about this place is... everything we get back comes double wrapped in plastic with a disposable hanger.*\n\nSo..\n\nI\u2019d avoid if you\u2019re reading this.\n\n*The owner has informed me below that there is a recycling bin. Moses is so helpful and always does such an outstanding job on my boyfriends suits! Thanks so much for being in the neighborhood! Amazing clean without that the chemical guilt, now I know why the stars go to CleverGreen! I'd recommend to anyone and everyone to at least give it a shot. Customer service was A+ as well I absolutely love this store. Every piece has been carefully curated and has so much history behind it. The owners are extremely knowledgeable and I really enjoy learning from them. They make the shopping experience so pleasant! I brought my mom and my sister here today and we had such a great time browsing through the beautiful items, chatting with the owners, and selecting a few (of many) gorgeous pieces.\n\nJanice and Cal are wonderful people who care a lot about their customers! This is my favorite store in Boston by far! It was my first time in Boston and the first place my daughter wanted to take me to! I am visiting from NC and have been to many antique stores and this was by far the best. Loved meeting the owners of the shop. They are knowledgeable, friendly, and went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and take our time to decide on our items. Honestly, chatting with them was as enjoyable as exploring the beautiful store. Visited here Saturday afternoon. The shop is a bit overwhelming.  It is more like a path through a maze of tables heaping with china. There is china on the floor, china everywhere you look.  There are some cute pieces but it\u2019s hard to even look when some you can\u2019t even get to. Their prices are a bit outrageous. No one is going to pay $85 for a small vase, $50 for tea cup and saucer, and $60 for a book you can get online for $12. Always check online. Owners were very pushy and hovered over us the entire time.  Couldn\u2019t even look at a French plate without them coming over. They will try to get you to buy anything and everything. Some things that don\u2019t even qualify as antique. Seems to me like they either can\u2019t sell things in this location or everything is priced way to high.  Who knows if they sell anything. Stepping into Elegant Findings is a wondrous journey tiptoeing through centuries of treasures. Each piece is hand picked, whether that be a single teacup and saucer or a complete set of Meissen dinnerware. The friendly shopkeepers are ready to assist with whatever you're looking for, or if you're just browsing, eager to chit chat sharing their vast knowledge of porcelain. This Beacon Hill gem is full to the brim with one of a kind porcelain, china, crystal, stemware, centerpieces, urns, vases, signed museum quality hand painted plates, oil paintings, clocks and so many more unique pieces and collectables that it feels like a treasure hunt every time I step inside. Always an adventure made so much more fun by Cal and Janice whose banter engages even the most reluctant customer. I highly recommend this shop to the serious collector or anyone seeking something that they won\u2019t find anywhere else. Janice and Kal are wonderful experts and professionals to work with in the antique business.  I feel so blessed to have met them in Boston. I live out of state and have been working with them for a while to expand my collection of China and the Lalique and Wedgwood along with other various pieces. Very dissappointed, gonna take a lot of time to heal my nails. I felt pain during acrylic nail removal and this is how they look now (2weeks after). They are filed way too thin and it\u2019s still very painful. I came here immediately after getting my nails done from another place on Charles Street. I won\u2019t name names, but the first place botched my acrylic French set for $70.\n\nI came to Pinkney begging for a last-minute saving grace and they delivered! Kelly is amazing- she really saved me, and I will now be getting my nails done here for the future. Thank you so much to all of the amazing girls working here!!! I will be back! Worst manicure ever! I asked them multiple times if they are able to do the design that I wanted and they assured me they could, I was okay with changing to a simpler design but they insisted. Throughout the process I raised my concern but the stylist kept going. Once finished I told her that this isn\u2019t what I wanted but she blamed it on the length of my nails and told me that this exactly what I asked for. Final results literally looked like someone scribbled sharpie on my nails. Definitely the most unpleasant experience I've ever had. I don't know her name, but she was someone who wore glasses, she was so rude for no reason and my manicure is so bad and when I tried to ask her if she can fix them, she gave me a lot of attitude and told me that it's my fault if I don't like them. Definitely go somewhere else Daughter no3 had manicure and I had pedicure. Friendly, clean and excellent service. Highly recommend Always a bizarre and unsettling shopping experience. The owners are plainly contemptuous of customers; they follow you around as though you\u2019re going to steal something despite there being no accessible merchandise small enough for anyone to discreetly shoplift (they follow you around even if you\u2019re a repeat customer who has consigned items with them). Most items are wildly overpriced. You\u2019re better off purchasing and selling items through luxury second-hand dealers on the internet. Super chic boutique with a selection of incredibly well kept designer items. The staff is kind and helpful in providing assistance while shopping! Some folks left reviews complaining about limited capacity and being followed around. This is a VERY high end consignment shop and they WANT you to have a tailored experience! Don\u2019t go in to just \u201cbrowse\u201d if you aren\u2019t prepared *emotionally* for the prices of luxury retail. It\u2019s a wonderful store and I will most certainly be going back! Chic vintage store with high end brands.\nIt shows that the owner has a wonderful taste and offers high quality items. Can I give 0 stars for this review?  The older gentleman, who I assume is one of the owners, was being very catty to customers, seemingly without thinking they noticed his poor behavior.  This is not a good space to browse as there is always someone following you too closely to actually enjoy the experience. There are much more friendly and welcoming shops nearby in which I would rather spend my money. I wish there were 10 stars - our experience was that good! Heli and Paul are wonderful people. My family came home with lots of beautiful items. The store is a treasure trove. They don\u2019t let the shop get crowded, they help when asked and it is a lovely place to visit. We will be back! Adorable gift store with an interesting and unique range of items. I have stopped in Black Ink a few times this 2020 holiday season and I am so pleased with the shopping experience I've had and the products I purchased!\n\nThe store is teeny and the staff is doing their absolute best to accommodate shoppers during Covid-19. Although you can't shop around like normal, the staff is super willing to help you find the gifts that you need. I recommend going in and telling the clerk who you are shopping for and they will give great suggestions!\n\nFor gifts, I got some cute mugs, a calendar, a decorative bowl, and some greetings cards...but they have so much more! This store is great. I enjoy coming here to glance at the merchandise and I always visit here when I need to get a gift for just about anyone. Puzzles, jars, books, salt shakers, book ends, bags, kettles, etc. The merchandise is eclectic yet familiar. Quirky, and I say that with pride. The staff is friendly. A treasure on Charles. There is so much fun, unique stuff stacked to the ceiling in this small store. I love to come in here to find gifts for those impossible-to-buy-for acquaintances. The inventory refreshes pretty often, so you can stop by frequently to find new cool things. They have kids toys, books, housewares, jewelry, stationary, and much more. I love the card selection here. I always come to purchase something personal but different. I have gotten many compliments from the cards purchased here. They can be kind of pricy but worth it. This is a great place to get an unique gift as well especially for children. They have great foreign gifts and interesting books. I think they do wrapping as well. In a pinch for a gift, this is your place, you can get the gift, the card, the wrapping, you are set and probably with something really cool. Such a great shop for unique gifts!  Small items that are great for Christmas stocking stuffers like unique beer openers, chopsticks, mugs, toys and funny items. They can even seal your purchase in a tin can so they recipient has to use a can opener to open it! I love a good card shop.  This one has plenty of cards, and assorted gift items.  The staff were friendly and helpful. Absolutely incredible experience working with Geraldine on our wedding stationary!! We couldn't be happier with the way our Save the Dates and Invitations came out and we couldn't have done it without the great suggestions and extra care from the Rugg Road team. We loved the ability to customize while also using a traditional style. It was such a fun and special experience!! When our wedding was delayed the team even helped us create a perfect re-invitation that made it simple to update our guests. Beyond our wedding stationary experience, I just love shopping at Rugg Road, they always have unique gifts that I am excited to give to friends and family in addition to gorgeous cards and stationary. We are so grateful to have such a wonderful shop on Charles Street! Thank you for everything!! Geraldine helped us to create our wedding stationary last year. She had books of plenty of options but not too many to where it was overwhelming. She sent us proofs of our pieces and was so patient as we made tweaks before printing. Our beutiful stationary arrived in just one week. We have been back in to shop in her happy store with family and friends and she and her team are always so warm and remember who I am. Thank you, Rugg Road!!! Rugg Road, specifically Elizabeth and Geraldine, went above and beyond for my stationary and wedding suite needs. Elizabeth put in extra effort to help troubleshoot a paper/design problem and I was extremely happy with the results! I got so many compliments on my invites! They are super responsive and great to work with. Thank you ladies so much for all you do and did to make the wedding planning process easier! Will definitely be a repeat customer :) We are absolutely in love with our invitations and the whole experience that was at Rugg Road Paper Co. !!! Ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of going to a stationery store to pick out wedding invitations. I wanted to look through books of physical samples, I wanted to touch the options, and Rugg Road had no shortage of options! Geraldine was such a sweetheart to work with and she offered many helpful suggestions and ideas. I have to say I was quite overwhelmed with the thought of the process, but going to Geraldine eased my anxiety and helped this picky bride get the invitations of her dreams!! Not to mention, the store is more than just invitations... There are so many cool trinkets, greeting cards, magnets, papers, even novelty socks and oven mitts to check out!  I could have spent hours in there looking at everything! Cute little shop, not so little prices.  The staff are very friendly, seems like a very popular place. They have a variety of items including purses, sunglasses, and jewelry.  The biggest size the clothing goes up to is a 12/14. (In the XL section). Bought two hair bows, I love them. The clothes aren\u2019t priced incorrectly, they are all great quality.  Just maybe not the best place for everyone\u2019s bank accounts. ($200 blazers). Covet has a great selection of on-trend, high-quality pieces from popular brands! I love supporting sustainable fashion, and this shop is definitely one of my favorites. Like others have said - the staff is also friendly and so helpful! Highly recommend! I had the best time shopping here! All of the staff is extremely lovely and helpful. The store is well organized with labels on each rack denoting the item type and sizing, showcasing great pieces ranging in different prices. I was glad to see Black-owned designer pieces featured in the store\u2019s line up. I cannot recommend this place enough!\n\nSide Note\u2014 would love to see some more sizing inclusivity! Esp in larger clothing + shoe sizes \u2764\ufe0f Love this shop! I regularly shop and consign at Covet Beacon Hill and it\u2019s always a great experience. The selection of clothing, accessories and shoes absolutely slays. Plus, prices are so good!! If you\u2019re looking to get a luxury bag for a good price, you better shop here. The staff  are so friendly and knowledgeable. Also, it\u2019s dog friendly! This place was very cute and organized. However, I purchased a purse for $52, then when I got home realized it is a purse from Aliexpress for $15. I contacted the store and am waiting to hear back. Hopefully I\nwill hear back and be able to update review.\n\nUpdate: I heard back from the store. They said that they have a mix of second-hand items and items that they get from wholesale. Just be warned that they purchase and resell through unethical websites like Aliexpress. They did offer a return, but ONLY for store credit. I will no longer support this store. Purchase at your own risk Elegant, small bank. Been around for ages, very good service. Interest rates are low (such is the economy), but safe place for money. Attention to detail. Everyone at the bank is so helpful and welcoming. Great boutique! Super fun to visit and had many cute trinkets! The people there are so kind! There\u2019s a huge wall of jellycats there was a good selection of it too. The 2 people allowed in at a time rule seems reasonable! It\u2019s difficult times to run a small business. I recommend supporting this establishment \u2764\ufe0f it\u2019s so extremely small, they only let two people in the jellycat section at a time, so i felt like i was a zoo exhibit while i was looking and people watched me while i was there for maybe a few minutes. it was awful, and i wish i could have shopped longer, i probably would have picked a few more.\nbut also why did you guys rip the prices off and mess up the tags? it was ripped off so violently too, the front jellycat tags are now bent, when they were not when i picked them out. overall not a great experience and not worth it for jellycats if you care about collecting and the tag quality. i probably won\u2019t go out of my way to come here again when there are other places in boston to shop at.\n\nalso because she ripped of the tags, according to the receipt i can\u2019t return any of them (luckily i don\u2019t need to). she completely took off the bar codes. never again coming here\n\nare you guys just watching reviews, because i got a reply within three minutes of posting. that\u2019s a wild response back. my biggest issue was the barcode ripping, if you read this whole thing. i just had a mild critique about feeling uncomfortable in your store, which i think should be noted, and didn\u2019t need to be taken personally. also the tag did rip in the process of whatever was removed, so take accountability. if this is how you take comments, no thanks. it\u2019s weird that you looked up my transaction too Best little and local shop around. The staff are always so nice, helpful and always attentive. They have the best selection, especially for Jelly Cat lovers. Very cute little shop with lots of trendy gifts! It is definitely worth popping in to if you are in Boston. Beacon Hill is a nice area to stroll and do some shopping. Lovely shop with friendly staff and the most beautiful/extensive jellycat collection. I especially loved the holiday-themed selection. Gary is not only a master of style, but of connection and warmth. His passion for artistry and precision is rivaled only by his patience and empathy towards his clients, who we\u2019ve been blessed to be for several years now. An absolute pleasure to do business with him; cannot recommend highly enough. My fianc\u00e9 and I designed my engagement wedding together at persona. I could not be more happier with how it turned out. With the amazing creativity and insight from Gary, he created a ring that went above and beyond what I could have ever expected. I only knew a vague idea of what I wanted and he understood right away and took that idea to the next level. Created such an amazing engagement ring and made an amazing engagement ring. I definitely recommend Persona is you are looking for custom pieces or need service done to your jewelry. I made an appointment to get sizing and an appraisal done for an engagement ring through their website which was very easy to do. Alana reached out to me a few hours later just to confirm everything, which I really appreciated. The appointment itself was quick, with everything being done in just two hours. I was incredibly impressed by the professionalism of Gary and the entire team. They are definitely going to be my go-to jeweler in Boston! I purchased an engagement ring for my sweetheart (now fiancee:) from Persona. The ring came out absolutely perfect! Gary helped pick the center stone, offered great expert advice for the design of the setting, was very understanding of my financial situation, helped save a few hundred dollars without compromising on the quality. And the ring was made incredibly quickly -- just a little over 2 weeks! Gary is an honest good man, brilliant at his job, I am very grateful and lucky I went with him and his colleagues! Excited to come back for the wedding bands soon! I had Gary at Persona design and build an engagement ring and I could not have been happier with every step of the process. Gary took the time to show me several diamonds and settings until we landed on the perfect combination. His calming presence immediately took the stress out of the entire process. I could immediately tell I was in the right hands with Gary and his team. The ring was ready before I knew it, and I could not have been happier. They do STUNNING work! Most importantly, my fianc\u00e9 was beyond thrilled with it! We are so happy.\n\nGary listened carefully to our ideas for wedding bands, and again didn\u2019t disappoint. He created two amazing rings with some very special personal touches. Perfection again!\n\nThe team at persona have bent over backwards to make my wife and I happy. They are always honest. They are always ready and willing to help us. Can\u2019t recommend Persona enough.\n\nShe absolutely loves the ring, and we absolutely love Persona. We are customers for life.\n\nThank you Persona! Sara Campbell has an eloquent touch.\nEach piece has it\u2019s own personality. The shop itself is quaintly tucked back from Charles St. As you turn the corner you feel as though you may be stepping back into a simple time. Walking in, I was welcomed and assisted with professional kindness.\nThank you! The sales person was beyond rude, flatout insulted me when I went in to return an item I had purchased 2 days before. She implied that I had worn the item, 1st she couldn't find my info in system. Thank God I had my paper receipt dated not the day before but the day before that. Then she tried saying I would only be getting gift card back when I paid with my debit card. Another customer was admiring my raincoat and asking if it came in any other colors [mine was yellow] because she could not wear yellow and the salesperson chimed in saying, ' \"Yeah NO ONE CAN WEAR YELLOW\" I said well I am wearing yellow. Her response was oh no I was talking about myself. I could not believe how I was being treated. I was a new customer too. When I purchased garment there was a different salesperson working who was awesome and so welcoming. The mean girl salesperon was Caucasian, prob 5'4 in hieght shortish blackish hair, somewhat tan skin, prob mid 30s and what looked to be a surgically enhanced bossom. I felt horrible when I left like I had done something wrong. The garment I returned was intact. Never worn, had all originally tagging [in the bag] accompanied w/sales receipt. Then she said can I ask you why tags are removed from item and I said because I put on to wear so I normally remove tags from garment I am about to wear at which point I did.not.like the way he fell on me which i originally stated at the beginning of this tortuous transaction which she made painfully difficult for no reason. If I were indeed attempting something clandestine as she was suggesting I would have re attached tags. Anyways BEYOND Beyond RUDE. Would never go there again Stopped by while roaming aimless in Boston, fab employee!  Didn't purchase  anything, nice conversation and she gave a small bottle of water - top notch customer service! Flower shops should be exquisite as a homage to the what they carry!\n\nAnd this one sure is!\n\nTraditional with their stem bar, and innovative with their wreaths, this flower shop has beauty for all those who hope to acquire it fleetingly!\n\nThe people who work here are delightful as well.  I mean, wouldn\u2019t you be joyful if you were surrounded by flowers, all day, every day?! Surprised my mom with flowers today on her birthday trip to Boston from Rouvalis Flowers. They delivered right to her hotel within an hour and a half of me placing the order on their website. The flowers are so so beautiful, even nicer in person than on the website. My mom can\u2019t stop crying. Thank you for helping me make her day even more special! Process was seamless as well. Will definitely use again and recommend to anyone in the Boston area. My go-to florist! I\u2019ve been purchasing bouquets from Rouvalis over the last 2 years and they never disappoint! The arrangements are always above and beyond and the flowers are ALWAYS fresh. Every time I buy an arrangement from Rouvalis the flowers last so much longer compared to other florists I\u2019ve used in the past. They\u2019re also extremely accommodating, easy to work with, and the delivery is always faster than expected. Would definitely recommend if you ever need a pop of color at home or need to send an arrangement! The Rouvalis flowers for our daughter\u2019s baby shower were spectacular and far exceeded my high expectations! Loved the radishes and carrots to complete the Beatrix Potter theme. Will definitely use Rouvalis again for my next event! Highly recommend! I ordered a same day delivery arrangement for my daughter's birthday and didn't give any specific instructions except that my daughter likes a more wildflower look.  The arrangement delivered was AMAZING and exceeded all my expectations. The picture doesn't do it justice. Thanks so much.  Highly recommend. I would give it zero stars if I could. Me and my friend were SO excited to try Dubai chocolate that we traveled to our local mall JUST for the purpose of trying Dubai chocolate. We spent $30 on one bar\u2026 and I think the picture will explain the rest. It was oily, drooping, and a total scam. First bite! Came to try the viral Pistachio chocolate bar and it was amazing. A few weeks later we Came back to get more and was very dissatisfied with the quality of the Chocolate they sold us. It was NOT the same chocolate quality and formula from the first time we had it. This was a super thick hersheys milk chocolate bar with pistachio filling. The chocolate bar looked and tasted old. The poor lack in quality to meet supply and demand is shameful of them to trick consumers. Nuts Factory is a nationwide chain of chocolates and candies, specializing in multiple different areas such as Dubai Chocolate and other chocolate goods.\n\nWe tried the Strawberry + Dubai Chocolate combo, which came with pistachio butter and other toppings. At around $18, the pricepoint is a bit steep, but the quality of the chocolate was decent and I thought it was worth it for the experience. The chocolate was smooth and not too sweet, but went well with the chocolate.\n\nOverall, a decent experience, but not one I'd indulge in a lot. I like this location\u2014though it\u2019s a bit overpriced for what it is, I really enjoy the Dubai chocolates. However, there\u2019s no clear system for lining up at the register, so people just crowd around, which can be inconvenient. My biggest issue is the fluctuating price of the Dubai chocolates. While they\u2019re generally around $20 a bar, some weeks they\u2019re cheaper, and sometimes there\u2019s a special. When I asked the attendant why the price changes so much, she simply said, \u201cbecause of the war in Israel.\u201d I visited the Nuts Factory, and it was a true treat for anyone who loves gourmet snacks! The wide variety of roasted and chocolate-covered nuts along with delicious brittle options had something for every palate. Their beautifully packed gift boxes make it a perfect place to grab a thoughtful, tasty gift or snack. The freshness and quality of each item were top-notch, and I loved the motto, \u201cEat Good, Feel Good!\u201d Definitely worth a visit if you\u2019re looking for premium, healthy indulgence.\n\n#NutsFactory #EatGoodFeelGood #SnackLovers #GourmetNuts #BostonEats Been looking for a new dry cleaning spot and after trying some around Boston area, I decided to venture out and found my new spot Charles Street Cleaners. They are very helpful and SUPER nice. I'll never go any where else after experiencing their awesome service. My friend is absolutely in love with their alterations on her dresses. Everything comes out as good as new and Iam recommending them to all my friends. Not those franchise dry cleaners. A local dry cleaners owned by small business owners who TRULY take good care of your garments and do an amazing job. The lady is also a professional alterer with 30+ years of experience, so if you are looking for a trusworthy cleaners this is your place. For 3 blazers and one dress they were going to charge me $98! Avoid at all costs, take your stuff somewhere else Superior Tailoring and Dry Cleaning Services at Competitive Rates!  I have always had a great experience at Charles Street Cleaners!  They offer the best alterations in all of Boston. Saved the day for my daughter! We need an urgent alteration, and of course she made it happen! Got a manicure here and the nail tech removed my gel without soaking them off and filed my nails way too much. I politely asked her to stop filing and she ignored it and kept filing. Now my nails are completely damaged and some nails even split in half. It will take months for the nails to heal. I have been living in Boston for a year now and finally found my nail person! Victoria is so talented at dip. She keeps my nails a good length and is very talkative. My nails always last 3-4 weeks without cracks! Will be coming here for Victoria  always! I am not from Boston so I relied on Google reviews to select a nail salon. I have no idea why this place has such a high star review. The place was super tiny, didn\u2019t smell fresh, the seats were old/cracking, and the polish shelves had dust all over them. The pedicure was also majorly lacking. It was the shortest pedicure of my life. Barely filed my nails and only trimmed the cuticles on 1 toe. It was the oddest thing. After everything dried and I left I noticed that I still had polish on my skin.\n\nI wish I had gone somewhere else. Overall lazy and don\u2019t recommend. I\u2019m obsessed with Teke\u2019s nails. I don\u2019t understand why they are rated so poorly. Annie does such an amazing job with builder gel manicures and gel x nail extensions. She\u2019s amazing, I\u2019ve been impressed every time I\u2019ve gotten my nails done there. I can\u2019t recommend this place enough! I LOVE Teke's nails!  The team, especially Luna, is fantastic. The manicures and pedicures are done with care and the result is amazing: my mani's and pedi's last longer than anywhere else I've gone. Plus, my toenails are not at all what they used to be when I was younger and they manage to make them look beautiful which is quite a feat. The salon has a pleasant atmosphere and the team is super nice.  Highly recommended!!  Nina F. Beautiful bookstore but very crowded. Definitely check it out early in the day to beat the worst crowds. When I was there you could barely move around there are so many people stuffed into the narrow spaces.\n\nBesides the crowds, the interior was gorgeous and has many nooks to explore. All new and contemporary books.\n\nThere is a cute cafe downtown stairs which i will have to try next time because they required reservations. What a beautiful bookshop! Great selection of books and a small selection of other merchandise. Lots of different areas and the children's section was adorable. It had a tiny door through to the next room too, very cute.\nI'd say it is definitely worth a visit.\nThere is the cafe under the bookstore too, which looked lovely. It was full when I visited, so I missed out, unfortunately. Enjoyed this lovely bookstore recently.  Despite it's small size, it had a wonderful selection of books, so many genres. Every nook an cranny filled with books that you can literally spend all day and still not see everything.  The staff was very friendly,  the cashier was quick and despite the crowd in the store everything was moving at a brisk pace. Didn't get to try the cafe but I look forward to going there at our next visit. I absolutely adore this place! I only intended to visit Beacon Hill for a while, but ended up staying longer than I expected. The book collections are great, and I love the employee recommendation. The place is really cozy and pretty, they have a cute entrance for the cafe downstair, so definitely look for it if you visit. The cafe was fully booked, yet the staffs were friendly and the decorations looked beautiful. Awesome Christmas vibe! This has got to be the cutest book store I've ever been in! The staff were so friendly and all the little details made it so fun to explore from top to bottom. Def ask the staff about Paige the squirrels house and check out every floor even if it's not the type of books you read. Decent prices too my husband and I are visiting Boston and happened to stumble across this store. We our expecting our first child in October and are big fans of quality wooden toys and this store had loads of them! Lindsey and her boyfriend were so pleasant and helped us not only with shopping but with things to do around the area. We can\u2019t wait to return to the happy journey with our little one in the future! Beautiful little store. Has great products and books + a small playroom in the back my daughter was very entertained by while I shopped. Was also amazed the offered to deliver another customers purchase to their home in beacon hill later that day. Such a cute store! Lindsay, the owner, is very knowledgeable, kind, and was simply a delight to us and our 2 year old whom she remembered from a previous visit. The store is gorgeous and full of a variety of beautiful, high quality items many of which are imported from France. There is a playroom in the back where children can play, color and read. We were surprised by the super reasonable prices especially given the high quality and thoughtful curation! Will definitely be back! What a beautiful and fun store! Friendly and happy faces! Had such a wonderful experience shopping at the The Happy Journey kids boutique! I was looking for an heirloom-quality, traditional piggybank for my four-year-old niece and had been unable to find ANY kids store in Boston that actually sells piggybanks. I had promised my niece a piggybank so that she could store her \"shiny pennies\", and was beyond excited to find that the Happy Journey sells actual piggybanks! Loved this place, and the staff were incredible at gift wrapping my little niece's valued birthday gift! Staying in Boston for one night, I did a quick Google search and came across this establishment that serves brunch all day. I was impressed by some of the pictures posted. Entering the restaurant, I was not disappointed. We were greeted by very friendly staff who brought us promptly to a table. The food was phenomenal and arrived very quickly after ordering. Additionally, the waitress was very kind and was able to make a custom latte with an alternative milk for me. We will certainly return when we stay in Boston again. 10/10 recommend. I can't believe I never wrote a review about this place, we went almost 10 years ago. The place was amazing! We're thinking of taking a day trip just to eat breakfast! :) We chose this restaurant due to its close location to Boston Common to meet up with our tour group. The staff are very welcoming and kind as we sat ourselves. It was pretty empty when we first arrived but has filled up since eating. My girlfriend and I both got the egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and added bacon for an additional $4. The sandwiches were quite bland and nothing too special about them, 4/10. We also got the caramel & banana french toast which I thought was the star of the show. I felt like it had a great balance of sweet and tasty, 7/10. My girlfriend thought it was too much caramel, 5/10. So warning, if you aren\u2019t a caramel fan then you won\u2019t like this. Overall, if you are looking for a brunch restaurant close to Boston Commons then this would be a good option. A Solid Meal with Room for Improvement\nParamount offers a decent dining experience with generous portions and reasonable prices. While the food was satisfactory, it didn't quite reach the heights of culinary excellence.\nThe service was average, with staff being polite but not particularly attentive. The wait times were reasonable, and the atmosphere was unremarkable.\nThe highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the generous serving sizes. The egg benedicts florentine was particularly impressive, leaving us feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed.\nWhile the food was okay, it lacked a certain flavor depth that would have elevated the experience.\nOverall, Paramount is a solid choice for a casual meal. If you're looking for a place with large portions and affordable prices, you might consider giving it a try. However, if you're seeking a truly memorable dining experience, you may want to explore other options. I have no idea why this place is on every must go-to breakfast lists. The food was meh. Not great but not bad. The potatoes were over seasoned, the bagel bread had zero flavor, and the caramel sauce was actually kind of gross. We recently had a nice dining experience at this restaurant near Acorn Street in Boston, where the menu caught our attention as we were walking by. The outdoor seating was perfect for enjoying the beautiful weather and scenic street views, which added to the charm of the meal.\n\nWe ordered the Red Sox pizza, which was flavorful, and a salad featuring beets and pistachios with a delicious dressing that tied everything together nicely. The food was definitely the highlight of our visit.\n\nUnfortunately, the service was a bit lacking\u2014our waitress wasn\u2019t particularly helpful or attentive, which took away from the overall experience. Despite that, the quality of the food and the lovely location made it a pleasant meal, and I would recommend it for the food and ambiance alone. Insane this place is sub 4 stars. The pizza was delicious, the fries were great, and our server was attentive but wasn\u2019t bugging us. Small place so make a reservation, but it\u2019s very nice inside. Quattro Formaggio was delicious Incredible food! I love the brick oven pizzas and the broccoli is delicious. I also ordered the Greek salad with chicken, and the meatballs and pasta is unbelievable!\nCame with a group. Love the new decor, and their outdoor area is super relaxed and amazing location in Beacon hill. Service was quick, and the staff is super friendly. Todd English is an incredible chef, and I love how delicious and approachable his menu is. They have something for everyone here. Nobody is leaving hungry! This was our second time within a year we went there. We ordered a pizza and meatball sider at first, it was so good we ordered another pizza! The pizza crust unbelievably delicious! The outdoor atmosphere was also nice and our waitress was super kind and respectful. We will definitely go back ! For those with ALLERGIES: I couldn't order a pizza here because of potential cross-contamination with one of the toppings they offer. (Obviously the pizza I was trying to order did not have the allergen). I was a bit surprised when they said they couldn't offer me any of their pizzas, since nowadays preparing food separately without allergens is pretty common.\n\nI was able to order a non-pizza entree off the menu and it was delicious. Nice ambiance, and a pleasant experience overall!\n\nBut if you have allergies to any of the pizza toppings on their menu, you won't be able to order it! FYI before you go! Excellent! Loved the ambiance, food, drinks, wine selection, and service. We enjoyed the carpaccio, pizza, filet, pappardelle, and ice cream. I was hoping to talk with a sommelier   though. The manager was helpful in correcting the wine we selected. Definitely will return, they know they're special, and so does everyone else as they fill up! We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. The ambiance was lovely and quaint, but it\u2019s the service that stood out. Roberto was so kind and made wonderful recommendations due to my gluten sensitivity, which can be a bummer when eating out. The menu surprisingly had several GF options! The GF pasta was the best I\u2019ve had in Boston, hands down. Their wine menu was lengthy and well priced. We will definitely be back. I believe this is the best restaurant I\u2019ve experienced in Boston and the surrounding areas over the past decade in terms of service. I\u2019m not sure if the quality of all the staff is as high, but at least today, Jo provided service that left me extremely satisfied. There were several details that stood out to me, which is rare in Boston\u2019s dining scene. For example, when I ordered hot water for my family, Jo thoughtfully asked if we would like an extra pot on the side to ensure we could refill our cups at any time. Additionally, she would occasionally come by our table to check the temperature of the pot with her hand to ensure the water hadn\u2019t cooled down. She also made sure the table was tidy and checked if any utensils needed to be replaced between each course. Her introduction of the dishes and drinks was both professional and warm.\n\nAs for the food, it was excellent. I tried the three-course menu of Dine Out Boston menu, and the appetizer, main course, and dessert were all top-notch. If the regular menu maintains this standard and the overall service quality is as outstanding as Jo\u2019s, this will definitely be my favorite restaurant in the Boston area. Had such a fantastic experience here. The food and service were truly excellent\u2014everything felt thoughtfully done. Tried some standout plates that easily rank among the best I\u2019ve ever had. If you\u2019re visiting the city, this place should definitely be on your list.\n\nIt ended up being the perfect spot to grab a bite during my first trip to the area, and I\u2019ll absolutely be coming back next time I\u2019m around! Toscano offers an incredible Italian dining experience!\n\nI recently visited Toscano on Charles street, Boston with company friends. The moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm hospitality and a charming ambiance. The Risotto was fresh, and the flavors were so authentic.\n\nThe service was attentive and friendly, and the wine selection was impressive. Peter was really friendly and helpful. I\u2019ll definitely be returning soon!\" Staying in Boston for one night, I did a quick Google search and came across this establishment that serves brunch all day.

We had a simple margarita pizza and a simple pepperoni pizza with extra extra pepperoni.  Sadly Their version of extra extra pepperoni isn't the same as my version of extra extra pepperoni. This thin crust pizza was pretty good.  The guys that work there have a great attitude.And it's got a really fun vibe. We went there after a show, so it was pretty empty. Just before closing, they got our order out really fast. Stopped by on our trek of the Freedom Trail hungry after hours of walking. We wanted something quick before we headed for the pastry shoppes and this placed smelled amazing from a block away. Service was quick for a single slice and the pizza itself was good but not great. The pizza did have a bit of a weird aftertaste after eating it about half way. The inside is simple and fine as long as it's not too busy otherwise they would likely run out of seating. Twas' a colder \u2744\ufe0f\ud83e\udd76 snowy night in the middle of winter. As I walked the old school looking streets... There stood the dim warm lighting of pizza nearby. I walk in 10 minutes before closing and asked if they were \"still serving\"?  and they said they can still dish out some slices. I said, \"pepperoni please... And may I eat here while you sweep and close up?\"\n\nShe said \"no problem.\" And I stood there enjoying a slice of heaven. This pizza was really delicious. And they hit the spot serving as a pit stop from the 6 degree weather of pain just waiting for me outside as I continued my journey through Boston on foot.  \ud83c\udf55 Always a great experience at The Upper Crust Pizzeria on Charles St! The service is always friendly and attentive, which makes a big difference. The pizza is delicious, with large slices and a great price\u2014definitely a good value. The place is clean and has a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a quick meal or sitting down to enjoy. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a good pizza in Boston! Very casual, friendly location with food options for everyone. You can buy giant pieces of pizza affordably or you can buy an entire pizza made to order.\n\nThey have allergy friendly options for gluten free and dairy free pizza that tasted great! Our whole family enjoyed the stop and we would love to come back when we're in the area. We had a great dinner at 75 chestnut! Such a cozy ambiance with awesome food! We loved the ravioli and accidentally received the wrong one which the staff quickly realized and fixed for us! We appreciated the attentiveness and then got to enjoy both kinds!\n\nThis post was made in connection with a Toast promotion. We attended one of their special events, The Gingerbread House making event.it was so much fun!! they already made the gingerbread house so all we needed to do was decorate. It was so well organized , beautifully decorated for the Christmas Season and the staff were just wonderful! The cost was $120.00 per person that included the gingerbread house, appetizer and an entree. There was a great selection to choose from. They also had a festive drink menus as well!\nThe restaurant is located in the heart of Boston in the Beacon Hill district, the old brick row houses and cobblestone walkways absolutely stunning! I recommend making reservations, the restaurant is small, but cozy and welcoming! no, there was absolutely no parking. It is located in a residential area so there is absolutely no parking.\n\nI highly recommend attending. It was a great time. You\u2019re there for about an hour and a half before the next group of people come in, but it was just a nice festive time. !! This charming American restaurant in Beacon Hill has a cool atmosphere and ambiance. The food is delicious, and the staff is incredibly kind and attentive. We tried the salmon and pork dishes, and both were fantastic. This quaint spot in Beacon Hill was the best place to catch up with a good friend and have awesome Italian food. Parking is challenging at best and a reservation may be needed so be sure to plan ahead. Our server was a charming addition to our visit. The food was delicious we had the lobster gnocchi and the Nantucket Seafood Stew \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0b I highly recommend - I would go again only via rideshare though. The area is historic with many admirable sights - if you can take advantage it makes the experience even better. Dessert was pretty good too. We\u2019ve been here a few times, but most recently dine out Boston lured us in. However when we sat down, we spotted two specials - the halibut and lamb chops - and couldn\u2019t resist ditching our plan. On par with past visits, the food was amazing and service attentive. And we decided to splurge for a dessert for a complete meal. The blood orange cheesecake parfait was unique and so delicious I didn\u2019t have time for a picture. Go here, order anything, it\u2019s great - but I definitely always recommend the specials. Finally a salad in this area with protein for under $20. The salmon chopped salad was a huge portion for the price compared to other restaurants on this strip. Salmon is served cold, but is cooked all the way through. Comes on top of a big bowl of veges, sunflower seeds, pepitas, a lovely side of dressing, and warm thick bread (reminded me of pizza bread almost). My friend ordered the same thing and also loved it. Would recommend if looking for an affordable healthy option! The quality of the breakfast was the best breakfast experience of our trip from the UK. Seriously good food priced well. Really cute cafe.\nI had avocado toast.\nWould be 5 stars if they had customer toilets. I ordered a Cuban sandwich, and after taking a bite I saw it didn\u2019t put any pulled pork on it. When I went up to ask about that, the guy at the counter said they were out of pulled pork, but would happily add more ham. He then took the sandwich _with a bite in it_, added more ham, and then put it _back in the panini press_.\n\nI\u2019m not sure whether to give 5 stars for the service or 1 star for the lack of hygiene practices, so I\u2019ll average it and say 3 stars. In any case, the lack of caring left me almost impressed. It was like watching James Harden play defense in a regular season game. Cobblestones catered my engagement party and absolutely nailed it! Jennifer, the owner, was amazing to work with\u2014helpful, passionate, and genuinely excited to be part of our special day. The food, from sandwiches to cupcakes, was incredible, and she made the whole process feel effortless, like working with a close family friend. To top it off, her pricing is unbeatable. Highly recommend Cobblestones for any event! A convenient spot for sandwiches and quick bites.\n\nBeacon Hill area doesn\u2019t have a lot options for sandwiches, and Cobblestone offers causal and welcoming vibe, perfect for a quick stop.\n\nDuring my past few visits, I tried the Revere and Cuban sandwiches. While they won't redefine your sandwich expectations, both were more than adequate for a quick lunch. The Revere Sandwich, with its sharp cheddar and horseradish aioli, offered nice balanced flavors, while the Cuban Sandwich had a good classic porchetta and pickles combo.\n\nOverall, Cobblestone is a straightforward, no-fuss eatery that delivers on its promise of good, quick sandwiches. If you're in the area and need a quick meal, Cobblestone might be worth a visit. We had a simple margarita pizza and a simple pepperoni pizza with extra extra pepperoni.

Our whole family enjoyed the stop and we would love to come back when we're in the area. Never disappoints. Had carry out this evening, pizza and a vege burger club with fries, both excellent. Large portions and great quality. When the lady is on, she cares. Everyone is complaining because they are Indian,  and the food is bad. It is not. The guys back there need to show love. Please I have been living in the Beacon Hill area for the past six months. I have tried  every pizza place in the area. Primos is by far the best. The flavor of the toppings and the crust is sensational. I love the double dough option which makes the crust pan style. I also recommend the buffalo wings with blue cheese, also add their fries.\nTo make this an honest review here are some of the negatives. The garlic bread was not very good. The onion rings I tried were burnt and super oily, I only ate two. The buffalo chicken strips were terrible. the sauce is good but it did not go well with what ever they use for a chicken strip.\nThe neutral.  The salads they make are good, however they use way too much iceburg lettuce in them. If they used some other greens it may improve.\nPrimos has a big menu. I was unable to try many of the other items because I am hooked on the double dough pizza and buffalo wings.\nPrimos has an online option to order or you can just call them. They deliver too. I have probably made a total of 15 visits so far. First time eating pizza in Boston and it was okay. It was a basic tasting slice. Place was nice to eat at, but had no ac. There was no fountain soda or ice. We stayed in Boston for the weekend and wanted to try some pizza so we opted for Primo. It was a delivery order and the food arrived hot! We got a white pizza and an order of mozzarella sticks. The pizza was very salty and we felt pretty dehydrated after eating a couple pieces each. Domino\u2019s makes a better white pizza. The mozzarella sticks were yummy though but nothing extraordinary. I wouldn\u2019t come here again. It\u2019s 7 pm, 30 min until closing. I\u2019m coming in parched after a Friday night workout. I order an iced drink, only to find out is out for the night. Somewhat defeated, Yari provides alternate iced drinks. She was super accommodating. Both Kathy and Yari provided such awesome customer service and such great attitudes. It was my first time going to this Starbucks and I\u2019m definitely coming back! This Starbucks not only provides a delightful retreat for coffee enthusiasts but also positions you perfectly to immerse yourself in the rich tapestry of Boston's urban landscape.\n\u2615\u2615\ufe0e\u208a\u02da.\ud83c\udfa7 \u2729\uff61\u2615 \ud83e\udd0e\ud80c\udf62\u05b4\u0ecb\u2615\ufe0f\u2727\u02da \u0f18\u2615\u2615\ufe0e\u208a\u02da.\ud83c\udfa7 \u2729\uff61\u2615 \ud83e\udd0e\ud80c\udf62\u05b4\u0ecb\u2615\ufe0f\u2727\u02da \u0f18\u2615\u2615\ufe0e\u208a\u02da.\ud83c\udfa7 \u2729\uff61\u2615 \ud83e\udd0e\ud80c\udf62\u05b4\u0ecb\u2615\ufe0f\u2727\u02da \u0f18\u2615\u2615\ufe0e\u208a\u02da.\ud83c\udfa7 \u2729\uff61\u2615 \ud83e\udd0e\ud80c\udf62\u05b4\u0ecb\u2615\ufe0f\u2727\u02da \u0f18\n\nStarbucks on Charles Street in Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood offers a classic Starbucks experience in a charming setting. While the interior is limited in seating, it provides a cozy atmosphere to enjoy your beverage. The staff is known for their friendly and efficient service, ensuring quick preparation of your favorite drinks. Additionally, the location is ideal for those exploring the historic streets of Beacon Hill, with many shops and attractions nearby. ... in the heart of Boston's historic Beacon Hill, the Starbucks at 97 Charles Street offers a quintessential caf\u00e9 experience. Patrons consistently commend the establishment's commitment to quality, with reviews highlighting the excellence of its offerings\n\nFrom this Starbucks, you can take a leisurely walk through the Boston Public Garden, a serene and picturesque park in the heart of the city. Continuing along Newbury Street, you'll find a variety of boutiques, galleries, and eateries. Further exploration leads you into the Back Bay area, known for its Victorian brownstone buildings and vibrant shopping and dining scene. This route offers a delightful mix of natural beauty and urban charm, making it a pleasant journey for both locals and visitors. Small and not much seating, but very glad it's there. You can always sit in the Public Garden, which has plenty of seating and is such a beautiful and restful spot. Staff were nice enough but the atmosphere is awful. Only a few tiny tables with too much empty space (could put more tables). Wanted to sit with my mom but there was only a single chair on its own so left straight away. The menu is standard Starbucks. The big inconvenience is that they don't have enough tables and especially not enough chairs. There is only one chair per table. Lately, we go elsewhere when no seats are available. Beautiful bookstore but very crowded. Definitely check it out early in the day to beat the worst crowds. When I was there you could barely move around there are so many people stuffed into the narrow spaces.\n\nBesides the crowds, the interior was gorgeous and has many nooks to explore. All new and contemporary books.\n\nThere is a cute cafe downtown stairs which i will have to try next time because they required reservations. What a beautiful bookshop! Great selection of books and a small selection of other merchandise. Lots of different areas and the children's section was adorable. It had a tiny door through to the next room too, very cute.\nI'd say it is definitely worth a visit.\nThere is the cafe under the bookstore too, which looked lovely. It was full when I visited, so I missed out, unfortunately. Enjoyed this lovely bookstore recently.  Despite it's small size, it had a wonderful selection of books, so many genres. Every nook an cranny filled with books that you can literally spend all day and still not see everything.  The staff was very friendly,  the cashier was quick and despite the crowd in the store everything was moving at a brisk pace. Didn't get to try the cafe but I look forward to going there at our next visit. I absolutely adore this place! I only intended to visit Beacon Hill for a while, but ended up staying longer than I expected. The book collections are great, and I love the employee recommendation. The place is really cozy and pretty, they have a cute entrance for the cafe downstair, so definitely look for it if you visit. The cafe was fully booked, yet the staffs were friendly and the decorations looked beautiful. Awesome Christmas vibe! This has got to be the cutest book store I've ever been in! The staff were so friendly and all the little details made it so fun to explore from top to bottom. Def ask the staff about Paige the squirrels house and check out every floor even if it's not the type of books you read. Decent prices too My daughter has only been at Advent for a few months so far (I'll update this review as we go along), but we are convinced we made the right choice for her, and for us. She loves going to school, the teachers are passionate and engaged, and the other families in the community are welcoming, down-to-earth, and have fascinating stories of their own.\nWhat made Advent stand out to us vs. the other elite private schools in Boston was its focus on social justice. They do seem to live their creed in their curriculum, and not only through the diversity of backgrounds we see in the classroom -- we were amused/a little teary eyed when our daughter, inspired by Advent, went \"trick or treating for UNICEF\" around our neighborhood on Halloween.\nSchools are not just for teaching academics - they have a tremendous effect on the values our children develop. We are so happy that Advent will be helping us provide our daughter with both strong academics and strong values. We feel so lucky to have found The Advent School.  Seven years in and we couldn't be more pleased with the education our kids are getting.  We really value the progressive approach to learning, the welcoming and involved community,  the amazing teachers, and the city as the classroom.    Our kids love going to school each day - what more could we ask for. One of the greatest amenities available to young families in Boston.  Provides the caring and intimate environment we wanted for our little ones in ECC (pre-K) combined with a thematic learning curriculum that really brought out the passionate learner in both my kids.  The teachers are incredible and love what they do (there are two in every classroom, plus specialists), and the kids respond to their energy.  The school uses its urban setting to make a campus out of the city of Boston, and my kids constantly bring home tales of their great adventures.  Love the diverse yet tight knit community - our whole family has made great friends.  Every school should be like this. I can't remember growing up and remembering but one or two of my childhood teachers I liked and was attached to.  Our kids still glow and hug each teacher from each grade year when they see them.  They love every teacher they have ever had and I have to believe the low student to teacher ratio has a lot to do with it as it allows the kids to get really close to them and a level of attachment that you don't get in other schools. Progressive gem of a school in the heart of the city. Love the personal attention that two certified teachers in every classroom provides, plus lots of specials including science, engineering, Spanish, yoga, art, PE. Warm, welcoming, inclusive and diverse community from all over the city of Boston. My kids love school. Sure wish I could have had this kind of experience when I was a kid!"

    "reviews": "When you first enter, this seems like a smaller CVS until you realize there's a second floor. Overall good service but the store does feel a bit messy. I still don't know why they lock up some of their items. Just get better security instead of making the honest people wait around for someone to unlock the shaving cream. I was very sad today to witness a black male being racially profiled by the cashier managing the self check out section, at around 2 pm today. He asked her if they had soap containers, she told him to pay 1st & then she would help him find the soap container, she then accused him of attempting to steal when everyone there could clearly see that he wanted to buy the soap container & everything else he planned to purchase all at once.\n\nWhen the individual walked in the store, he was followed. I could hear the cashier telling the guy, \"I know what you are trying to do\". The guy replied, \" I have no idea what you are talking about\". In the end, he paid for all his items & politely thanked her even though she was extremely rude to him. I've seen this employee smoking cigarettes by the front entrance on multiple occasions so I recognized her. She is a brunette, looks like she is in her 50's, or 60's. This was very sad to watch, I really hope this review will prevent this from happening to other customers in the future. I wish there was a way to give 0 stars. Great CVS! The store itself was standard, but the staff was nice, especially Rita. Welcoming experience and I was able to get what I needed quickly! TERRIBLE customer service upstairs. We went to get passport photos done. There was 2 employees and no customers and despite us asking for help both continued doing what they were doing. Once someone finally stopped to assist us, she couldn\u2019t even tell us the pricing. We walked back out. What a great pharmacy.  I needed a prescription filled pronto and the urgent care was next door.  They were able to process my prescription within 20 minutes and Rubi was super nice Hair stylist was extremely generous with her time and care she provided. As an older person of limited means as was taken care of with grace and dignity you\u2019d expect from a loving grand daughter, not an anonymous stranger. Very pleased Washed & conditioned my own hair before arriving. Got taken right away, even before check in. Easy online scheduling for preferred same day date/time.Well worth the trip into Boston from my home in Revere.Have visited this Salon several times,with different Styliists. Never Disappointed yet...Highly Recommended. The employees at Supercuts were very kind! Livia cut my hair and she was fantastic! She taught me so much about styling, how to take care of your hair, and expressed a genuine interest in getting to know me. She even shared some life lessons during my haircut. I really enjoyed my experience and would recommend Supercuts and Livia! She was so nice and the haircut came out great. Highly recommend! I have seen some negative reviews and wanted to share some of my experiences over the last ten years.  I have mostly gone to the Cambridge St. location, as well as Summer St.  I have only had positive interactions with each location.  Uyen (Cambridge St), Sam and Brittany (Summer St.) have given me exactly what I ask for, provide advice and execute quality haircuts every time.  Other employees are always friendly and engaging and add to my experience.  I have the option of going anywhere in the city to have my haircut, but for me this is the place to go.  Hoping that this helps if you are looking for a convenient and cost friendly option to have your hair cut. There is an Asian woman there. She\u2019s from Vietnam specifically. She is fantastic. Personality and her hairdressing skills. Thank you for the service. I\u2019m a post-Liver transplant patient and she should remember me from that. Kathy (the owner) is amazing! She did everything I asked for and made suggestions along with my asks. She did not try to push anything on me to raise the price and she and I had good conversation while she was doing my nails. Will definitely be going to see Kathy again in 2-3 weeks!\n\nI had gotten my nails done previously at a different nail salon nearby and I was not happy at all with how my nails came out. I\u2019m not sure if the guy was in training or what bc there was another woman constantly coming over to check on his work. My nails weren\u2019t the shape I wanted. I showed him a pic of she shape and color I was looking for and none of that is what I got. My cuticles weren\u2019t done , the acrylic was thick and uneven and I just wasn\u2019t happy.\n\nI went to Kathy at Cambridge nails a week later and showed her the picture and a different picture of the color and a different picture of the design I had wanted on a couple nails and she matched the color perfectly, did the shape perfectly and in my opinion the design (which she did by hand) was exactly what I wanted,  I also have anxiety and it is heightened when people speak another language around me, well, because I think they are talking about me. Obviously, this is expected at a nail salon and some salons do it more than others. I definitely didn\u2019t feel anxious there at all and felt calm and comfortable the whole experience. If you do not want your nails to bleed and not get an attitude from the staff do not go to this nail salon. First of all she gave me an attitude when she told me a WRONG color for my nails. My service was a simple DIP extension with a light pink color and she could not give me that. Apart from just that she made me bleed and gave me an attitude about it. On top of all of that the powder got all over the sides of my nails and she didnt bother to clean it before setting it so it looks like my fingers are so much more WIDER than they actually are. And my nails literally are not the same color in the picture you can see them coming through. I wish I did not tip but I still did. I went in to get my gel acrylic nails removed. They were close to my house so I made an appointment to go there. When I first got there, the lady told she would get me water to get the nails softened, which she never did, and then came back to literally use an utensil to RIP the acrylics off of my nails, which was very uncomfortable and painful. She had to cut the tips with a nail clipper to make it easier, so at the end my nails were all uneven. She did a quick file but I literally had pieces of my nail hanging off and all uneven, as you can see in the pictures. On the right hand you can still see some color on my nail from the acrylics. I kindly pointed it out to her and she said she couldn\u2019t take it off, it would come off in a few days. So I went through a painful method to get them off, my nails were all uneven at the end, there was still come color from the acrylics left on my nails, and there was a piece of my thumb nail hanging off of it. The pedicure I got four weeks ago is still in great shape. Very nice and relaxing as well. This is one of the most cleanest nail spas I have ever been in the area. All tools are brand new (meaning sterilized and in individual bags) and they just changed their massage chairs, I have been coming here for the last 15 years! What a sandwich exactly what I needed for lunch absolutely delicious!!! And you know that you can\u2019t leave a Butcher Shop like this without leaving with some kind of mouth watering delicious piece of meat \u2026.. Little Filet Mignon was a perfect choice i can\u2019t wait to try everything else.  WOOWWWW and the ice cream selection!!!!!! I'm not normally one to write reviews but I had such a bad experience here today that I feel compelled to.\n\nI came in just before 1 PM to pick up a few things for lunch. I took everything to the register and a guy with a short beard and dark hair started to ring me up. I wasn't paying super close attention and so I first tried to tap my card before he was done scanning my items, and he told me \"not yet\". I apologized and then looked at the small screen that shows your items as they're scanned. I waited until all the items were scanned, and then tried to tap my card. When that didn't work I tried inserting. Eventually I realized that the guy probably hadn't hit the button to complete the transaction, so I looked up and he said in a super aggressive tone \"it's not ready yet sir\", and then promptly pushed the button. There was nothing left to be done on the transaction so I guess he wanted to show me up for trying to tap my card early or for staring at the screen as he has scanning my items? When I finally paid he put my things in a plastic bag (which I didn't ask for and I'm guessing he charged me for?).\n\nI'm not sure what this guys problem was but the way he acted was really uncalled for. I have a disability that makes me lightheaded when I walk around sometimes and so I was probably just a little fuzzy when I accidentally tried to tap my card the first time. I've always like Savenor's in the past but I'm a little hesitant to go back now... We order ducks for Christmas from them every year. This year, we ordered two ducks to be delivered to our home for Christmas, but only one was in the bag. We called and they were able to immediately deliver us the second duck on Christmas Eve within two hours!!! Talk about incredible customer service. Their ducks/meat are always juicy and delicious. The fact that they went out of their way last minute on Xmas Eve to bring us the missing duck was above and beyond! We love this company so much thanks again! I've only shopped hear a few times but every time it's been a real treat. Most recently I went in to purchase a St. Louis rack for a birthday celebration. They must treat those pigs up in Vermont reeeeaaaall well because these babies knocked it out of the park. Huge, succulent, moist, flavorful ribs, maybe the best rack I've ever smoked. Will definitely be back again for my next special occasion, and I highly recommend them. Was excited to try the A5 wagyu from this place, but it turned out to be an incredibly disappointing experience. The quality of the meat was far below expectations\u2014it was mostly edge pieces with excessive fat that should have been trimmed off, yet they were sold as part of the product. For a premium price that's a quarter above the market retail for A5 wagyu, you'd expect exceptional quality and attention to detail, but that was clearly lacking here. It seems the store has no discernment about what constitutes good wagyu, which makes the pricing even more unjustifiable. Strongly recommend looking elsewhere if you're after genuine, high-quality wagyu. I parked at the charles street lot 2 days ago. I reserved and pre payed online. My ticket was validated for $15 by the restaurant i went to. When i picked my car the attendant assured me they would credit my account. That never happened and my charge card had a $650 charge to a camera store the next morning. I tipped this guy well. Dishonest world we live in. Review:\nMy recent experience at LAZ left me deeply disappointed and frustrated. Despite being promised a reasonable rate of $46 for a 48-hour parking period when I left my car on a Thursday night, I was shocked to discover upon return that I was charged a whopping $104. When I requested a receipt to clarify the discrepancy, the staff member not only refused but also declined to provide their name or allow me to speak with a manager.\n\nThe level of rudeness and unprofessionalism displayed by the staff was appalling. Despite acknowledging that a colleague had provided me with incorrect information regarding the parking rate, there was a complete lack of accountability and disregard for customer satisfaction. To make matters worse, I was subjected to offensive remarks questioning my understanding of how things operate in this country simply because I am not a native resident.\n\nTo the owner of LAZ, it is imperative that you address the dishonest practices and disrespectful behavior exhibited by your staff. It is unacceptable for customers to be taken advantage of and treated with such disdain. This experience has not only left me feeling cheated but also compelled to warn others about the unethical conduct at your establishment.\n\nMessage to the Owner: Your staff's actions are tantamount to taking advantage from your clients. Take immediate action to rectify this situation and restore trust in your business. DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER. WILL LOSE PERSONAL ITEMS.\nWhen I attempted to retrieve my vehicle, the attendant asked for my ID. I removed it from from my wallet, gave it to him to inspect. He took it and left the room to find my vehicle. When he returned with my vehicle, he asked for payment. Like most guys, I keep my ID and credit card in my wallet. He charged my card, handed me my credit card, I got in my car and drove away.  When I got to the TSA gate at Logan later and realized I had not received my ID, I called the garage... FOUR TIMES. Each time they said they would look and asked me to call back in about five minutes.  Frustrated I'd missed my flight, I drove back to the garage.  No one would assist me in finding my ID claiming that if it was around the garage, \"we would have found it by now\".\n\nOne star because at least they kept my car safe. The attendant's at the Charles Street Lot in Boston were very professional and courteous. The first lot attendant I met made sure I had parked my car ok as I backed into my parking space. When I needed help to validate my ticket for Mass Eye and Ear one of the lot attendants showed me where to go to get it validated and what I had to do. When I got back to the lot he even came back over to make sure I had got my ticket validated OK. This lot is very clean, well maintained with bright easy to see parking lines. Also feels very secure as well. Thanks Again Charles Street Laz Team! Park there every day since July 2020 because I work at the hospital. Unfortunately, whenever it\u2019s convenient for this white manager, he will tell me they cannot park my car when they are able to accommodate other cars. Happen to be the only black woman there as well that morning. Meanwhile, my coworker who is blonde and blue eyes with no park without any issues. A lot of other friendly faces but this particular manager is rude!! I've been a regular customer for 5 years, and this is the only place I go to for tailoring. They were closed for a while this year due to shop repairs, but I'm happy they were able to reopen.\n\nFrom hemming dresses, to taking in or letting out pants, to small repairs in fabric, these people are experts and always do a good job. Not to mention everything is done on time and it's not *too* expensive. I will continue supporting this small and local business. Thank you for taking care of my clothes! They charge great prices and are always so friendly. The tailoring that I've had done here has been perfect every time. I've sent several friends here with great outcomes, even for wedding dresses (after another tailor botched her fitting). would definitely recommend! Only drawback is that I think they don't do leather cleaning. Very pleased with the quality and prices. Had some wool pants tailored, a silk blouse taken in, and a sweater dry cleaned for ~$55. Nice people and service was quick. Recommend! It\u2019s a mom and pop shop, always so friendly and kind! I do both dry cleaning and tailoring, both are always awesomely done, especially the tailorings, I\u2019ve brought pants, dresses, coat over, all came back great for reasonable prices. Not to mention the location is very convenient for the West End areas and close to the red line T stop. 0 out of 5 experience. Do NOT go here. WASTE of time and money. They overcharge based on the time of the day or their choice of feelings. I brought one color jacket pieces and they still found an excuse to charge me almost double the prices on their wall.\n\nSo unfortunate. Excellent staff. Very helpful and pleasant. The store is clean. For a small store it was excellent Great staff.  As a Door Dasher I am very happy that my pick ups are always ready and correct. A litter over price thier ounce look small compared to other places I been too don't know if I will go back but I did get a half and just like I thought it was small too This place has changed for the worse! To start they got rid of the area where the various lottery game slips are and the scan machine. I then had to ask for a Powerball slip from the store clerk/cashier. I find that odd. Why are they not on display? After that I decided to buy a couple of scratch tickets. When I started to scratch the guy then says oh we don't do scratching in here or something like that! I have NEVER been in ANY place big ,small, gas station, convenience store and liquor store that has acted like this! There also were barely any selections of tickets. That was not the case years ago. The old clerks were nice! It's real simple. If you don't want to provide proper lottery services, why did you become an agent? I haven't been ever since. Lovely place. A bit pricey l, but that\u2019s to be expected given their location. There\u2019s no place more convenient to shop than a local store. Great variety at multiple price points. Staff was super friendly and helped me find a specific bottle I was looking for When I first arrived in Boston (for the marathon) I was on a mission to search out some local gins. It took awhile but then I found this place which had the most extensive range of local spirits imaginable. The staff are extremely friendly and provide excellent service. They also stock some good mixers. Just love this place\u2763\ufe0f They are very nice overall. Every time I visit, they are always open for conversation and try to make a good suggestion, in which they don't try to make you feel like you have to buy something. Store is always bright and I mostly see them smiling toward whoever walks in. a great liquor store in Boston!! The staff here are incredibly helpful. This shop is on my way to the subway, and I always pop in if I'm on my way to a dinner party. If I know the menu and ask, the staff will help me select a great option. The beer selection is great, wine selection is great, and they have tons of liqueurs and liquors. AND Luxardo cherries (ugh, so amazing and so expensive, but worth it). I've had help selecting beer for a pizza party, wine for a Spanish tapas night, wine for a seafood dinner. All were great selections. Fantastic beer selection, especially in the build your own 6 pack section. Also have a tremendous amount of wine. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful too. I had such a great experience at the UPS store thanks to Patrick! He was incredibly friendly and went out of his way to help me with my shipping needs. He made everything easy and stress-free, answering all my questions with a smile. I live across the street and come in all the time to sell my old clothes. Patrick is the best. Always so helpful!!! Patrick is the best, so helpful and attentive to his customers. Will definitely be coming back again & exclusively shipping with UPS. All thanks to Patrick! Great ups store. Always crowded but the guy at the front keeps the line moving. Very efficient and I\u2019m grateful while I\u2019m standing there holding heavy boxes! Kevin was very helpful and took care of my package immediately! My package ended up at this post office, where it proceeded to be misdelivered twice before being returned to sender due to incomplete address. My address was detailed and complete. No way to get in touch with the location directly. Just a machine that doesn't allow me to ask specific questions. I ordered another package also out for delivery, that arrived on time. The difference? It was lucky enough to not make a stop at this location. I try to airdrop this picture to the mail carriers whenever I see them on their route but they\u2019re such hard workers that they\u2019re never on their phones! They\u2019re my dog\u2019s hero. Five stars for that! This USPS is old fashioned neighborhood friendly.  They are pleasant and move at a good pace. Excellent service and convenient location right by red line stop. This is a wonderful post office!  I\u2019ve been a customer since 1969.  Postal sales associates very competent, pleasant, knowledgeable, and efficient. Easily handicapped accessible. Being open on\nSat 8-noon helpful. So good! The bread is so soft and pairs beautifully with the burgers. The fries were seasoned perfectly. The owner is attentive and friendly. Overall fantastic experience and lunch.\n....\nUpdated 3/19/25:\nThey've moved and still SO GOOD. My husband and I have moved out of the area and miss Rooster's so much. I had an appointment in Utica and had to stop in to day hi and grab lunch. Consistent and delicious as always. \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf5f Great place to get a burger! Owner was great and we talked briefly about the business. Fresh rolls brought in daily, sauce was good and burger had a nice crust on it. Had the Rooster double and will go back to try the Figgy! Limited menu done right! Highly recommend! 2 burgers took 40 min, and when we got them the burgers were cold. Has  potential, buns were good, just to fix the speed and serve hot food. I found a great little burger place in Utica. It\u2019s called Roosters but makes the best smash burgers and chopped steak burgers in town.  The hamburger meat is freshly ground locally.  The buns are baked locally.  The fresh ground beef is smashed on to the grill.  The bun is hand cut and toasted on the grill while the burger is cooking.  The fries were hot, lightly salted and delicious.  The burger was outstanding.  The burger was nicely topped with plenty of your favorite fresh burger extras.  The burger was prepared the way I would have if I fixed it myself.  I had the single cheese burger but I recommend the double burger for those who like more meat.  In addition, Roosters makes their own rooster sauce if you want to try something new. The staff are friendly and courteous.  Overall, it was a great experience.  Get your next burger here! Enjoy! My husband and I had lunch here for the first time and I promise it won't be our last. We both had The Figgy Combo and it was the single best burger I've ever had. Even the fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Everyone is super friendly and the price is reasonable.  You cant beat it! Roosters is AMAZING! David is the absolute best, both hair stylist and person! He has been styling my hair for 2 years and I couldn\u2019t recommend him enough. I always leave the salon with a perfect haircut and bouncy blowout. He surpasses my expectations every time. On top of that he is a delight and has the warmest energy. It is always a treat to sit in his chair and chat while he works his magic. David has been my hair stylist for the last three years and if he told me that he was moving to Maine tomorrow, then I\u2019d be planning all my future appointments around driving to Maine. He is that talented. I dread even writing this review because I feel like he\u2019s the best kept secret in Boston. All to say: Beacon Hill Hair is amazing, David is exceptional, and I have never left his chair feeling like my hair was anything less than perfection. David did my hair today and it was amazing. He was so kind and sweet and really knew what he was doing! The appointment did not feel rushed and I left the salon feeling like the best version of myself! The other two stylists were so nice and chatty, it was such a great experience! 10/10 will be going again!! Disappointed! My 14 year old daughter and I stopped in to schedule a curly hair consultation. We shared with Kathleen that we wanted to discuss how to embrace her curls and to receive a cut. Kathleen said she could service us the next day. Unfortunately less than one hour before our appointment Kathleen texted that she was not feeling well and was taking the day but could accommodate us the next day. Fully understanding illness we agreed to the next day. When we showed up Kathleen was not there. My daughter was sat in David\u2019s chair without explanation. He than asked what was the plan. My daughter shared inspo pics and stated that she wanted to bring her curls back to life, obtain layers and keep her length where possible. She clearly shared her desired length. David, unfortunately cut an excessive amount of hair, gave one small layer and then proceeded to blow out her hair. My daughter left in tears. It was disappointing that Kathleen no showed and my daughter was not listened to. Hopefully others will not receive the same treatment and care. Beacon Hill Hair is such a fantastic environment to get your hair cut or colored! Kathleen the owner cares so much about all of her clients and treats everyone like family.\n\nI had the pleasure of having David cut my hair for the first time and it came out amazingly. I was so pleased that when he finished and took out the roller and competed the blow dry I just started to clap in my chair! David is nine years in the industry and you can tell by his expertise.\n\nMy hair was flat, heavy and lacking a lot of shape. I told him loosely what I wanted but I let him have fun with my hair and to do what he thought would look best. He trimmed it up and gave it so much body and life. I can\u2019t wait to go back in three months. I recommend David and Beacon Hill Hair without hesitation. Ugh! The last straw!\n\nQ: Who do you call when a frontloader machine is broken? A: No one. Basically lost $5.50 on heavily soaked laundry.\n\nLaundromat increase prices to wash clothes but deliver nothing. This is the straw that broke the camel's back. I am done with icky laundromat and broken machines. Waste of hard earn money and time! Switching to laundry delivery services for convenience. Do not come here. Machine upkeep is terrible. I put my wet laundry through three 70-minute cycles in different dryers and they were still soaking wet. There is attendant around. They monitor the laundry room remotely. So make sure you have crisp dollars because it would not take it. It is in the heart of Beacon Hill. It is $3.25 to wash a load. The laundrymat closes at 9:00 pm promptly daily. The end time changed per sign on the window. There on no front loader washers. Happy Laundromat Day! You heard it here first! When MaLaSpeaks Everyone Listens! Place is so small and many machines broken. Had to try three different dryers and second one ate my money so had to run to Harvards Gardens to get more change to be able to finish drying.\n\nI didn't  see the out of order sign on first one because it was so small just covering coin slot, but second one wasn't, there were few other machines  also marked out of order. Not good having broken machines with no onsite staff to assist customers. Very dirty place. Trashes all over. No plug for cell phone charging. Could be much well cared. As soon as I walked in the store I got asked questions and all I was trying to do was browse around and buy a bottle before my birthday. I don't what that guys problem is, he was disrespectful, his energy was off when I walked in and he seemed like he had an attitude with me for no reason. They are also very overpriced. Simmons is incredibly reliable and efficient. While I typically order off Ubereats, they sent me a flyer for their own app. You may not get the tracking to see where they\u2019re at, but there is more variety and the delivery man has consistently sent me \u201cdelivered\u201d photos to show me where it\u2019s at.\n\nI order pretty frequently for parties, and again, I have to emphasize they are consistently fast and reliable. I won\u2019t order from anywhere else. You\u2019ve won me over. The girls are happy! I wanted to take a few 4-packs of Cloud Candy back to Ohio. The cooler only had one left. As I was walking out, they asked if I was looking for something. Told them what i couldn\u2019t find, they went to the back and got exactly what I needed. Super helpful & friendly. Vansh is one of the nicest people I've ever met, and the staff is really helpful and kind. This is a terrific store. offers a superb assortment of wines and IPAs at extremely decent and affordable pricing when compared to other Beacon Hill retailers. If you're on the West End of Boston, then this is your liquor store. The owner is uber knowledgeable of wines & other liquors. They carry a varied selection, & it's always fun to see what they come across seasonally. The staff are helpful &  give do diligence in asking if you need any further help or choices. They're extremely well priced for the area. Stop in & check them out, you're sure to come away something. I randomly decided to eat in here and I'm very satisfied with this restaurant. The food is delicious and came out quickly. I had dumplings and the Jack BBQ burger (special) and my partner got the Harvard Garden burger. My server Adelaide was amazing. She noticed my bbq sauce was missing before I did and brought it for me. The service was amazing, atmosphere was great. I would definitely come back to eat here. Great bar with delicious food. Might be the best buffalo chicken wrap I've ever had. I'm an avid French onion soup eater and I really liked theirs as well. Highly recommend. Would come again! Great spot when you don\u2019t have somewhere to go .  Not a big fan of this place I remember a few issues before with attitude from staff. Lots of regulars and a chill vibe aside . Young couples come through for date nights and such but if you want to indulge this is not the place . They do not want your money . You can not purchase a single bottle of wine without someone else present. I finally told her I may drink the whole thing myself pissed off I had mother watching and said you seemed bothered I\u2019ll just have a glass. Guess they have had some mishaps before and I understand but some of us unfortunately can handle our small bottle of wine .  The funny part, she never offered me any water . Way to go bud! I love this place\nFor the last month my husband and I have been dealing with every parents worst nightmare. And the bar staff (Jon, Kayleigh, Karen and David)  the waist staff and Mike the general manager have been nothing more than understanding, and kind to our situation. But on top of it all is the FOOOOOOD. The calamari the high society burgers , The wild mushroom pizza. It's all freaking beyond expected. The restaurant itself exceeds all expectations I've ever had.... Even with door dash pickups.thank you all of you This restaurant went above and beyond to assist me in catering food to the staff of two units at MGH. I cannot thank Mike enough , the general manager, for being so helpful! He helped me decide what food to bring to the nursing staff, even helped deliver! The nurses were beyond grateful and were beyond excited to have pizzas. Which they said were delicious!\nI also dined in one night and the Greek chopped salad was wonderful. Super fresh. Great customer service and food all around ! I ordered 2 burritos for lunch this morning by pick-up. When we got there, the burritos were already made. But the thing is the staff didn't want to give me burritos because they were doing their own stuff, so we waited so long on the spot. Then we got them and when we tried to eat them, and as you can tell from the receipt, I realize the size is wrong. We ordered one large and one regular, but I got two of the regular size. I'm kind of dumbfounded because I think I got paid more and didn't get the right item. They did it last time, but I let it go, but the same thing happens again, so I have no choice but to write a review. If you ordered, make sure to check after receiving your item. I'm really disappointed Went to Anna's with my family while in Boston. Overall, the food was good but the experience was not so much. We felt rushed while ordering even though it wasn't busy. It was actually somewhat stressful. The chips and guac are a waste of money. Not enough guac and tastes average at best. The place was a bit messy. The floor on the lower level was wet. Soda machine didn't work. No napkins in dispenser. Honestly, i wish we would have gone elsewhere. Learned a lesson today\u2014if you\u2019re lookin for a special menu item, double check the restaurant\u2019s website, and beware of old pictures on the reviews. I went here looking for lengua tacos, which were shown in the google reviews, but found out when I got there that they weren\u2019t on the menu any more.  Not the restaurant\u2019s fault, so I can\u2019t mark them down for that. Ordered an al pastor quesadilla instead. What I got looked a whole lot like a burrito. It tasted okay, but wasn\u2019t anything particularly special. I also ordered the chips and guacamole. It tasted fine too, but the chips were mostly broken and in little pieces. Trying not to be too picky but it made it hard to eat the guacamole. The space for eating in was below street level. It was cramped and they weren\u2019t keeping it very clean. Overall, this food was just like the other fast casual Mexican places, very mainstream, the atmosphere could be better, and I won\u2019t go out of my way to eat here again. Mid-tier taqueria experience with decent food and drinks.\n\nAnna\u2019s Taqueria has been a reliable spot for Mexican bowls when I don\u2019t have enough time to travel to other areas for my favorite taquerias in Boston. It doesn\u2019t aim to be the best in town, but it is still a solid option for lunch and quick dinner.\n\nFrom the variety of meat options, the birria and steak roja are my favorites. Although they come with an extra charge, its worth the upgrade. The birria, a slow-roasted beef, is very tender and fatty, which pairs well with other fresh vegetable toppings. Steak Roja comes with a bit of a kick, but offers a more flavorful bite.\n\nTheir Horchata, served in an impressively large size at an affordable price, tends to lean on the milder side. It might not be the most authentic version, but as a refreshing drink that\u2019s an alternative to the usual soda, it does its job. Where I am: @Annas Taqueria\n.\nLocation Reviewed: 242 Cambridge St, Boston, MA 02114\n.\nMenu Includes:\nSalad bowl, Mexican bowl, burrito\n.\nItems Reviewed;\nChicken salad - DELICIOUS\n\nI tried their salad bowl with chicken. Their portions are big and will fill you up. If you\u2019re getting the burrito, you can also size up! The salad was good, the rice and chicken could be better tho. For someone who is conscious about their diet, this place fits the bill.\n.\nCustomer Service: On Point!!\n.\nOnline Navigation: Easy\n.\nParking:Rough\n.\nRecommendations: the bowl\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f=LOVE IT\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2795=LIKE IT\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f=DELICIOUS\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f=DECENT\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f=PASS\n\u2b50\ufe0f=NAH Food was delicious - takoyaki and fried gyoza were especially fantastic. The Thai Tea is also awesome! Great sushi spot! Reasonable prices and really good quality. The menu is expansive and good came out quickly. I would definitely recommend! If you\u2019re looking for the ultimate sashimi experience, this place is pure perfection. Every slice of sashimi is unbelievably fresh, with a melt-in-your-mouth texture that showcases the highest quality seafood. The presentation is like a work of art\u2014each piece carefully arranged to highlight its natural beauty. From buttery otoro to delicately sweet scallops, every bite is an explosion of pure umami.\n\nBeyond the food, the service is on another level. Attentive yet unobtrusive, the staff anticipates your needs before you even ask. They explain each dish with expertise and serve with grace, making you feel like a VIP from start to finish. The ambiance is nothing short of luxurious\u2014elegant decor, soft lighting, and a sophisticated atmosphere that elevates the entire dining experience.\n\nIf you want world-class sashimi with five-star service in an ultra-luxurious setting, this is the place to be. A true masterpiece of Japanese culinary excellence! Food is always very solid, i honestly prefer the lunch crew over the dinner one, atmosphere is great and playlist enjoyable. Desserts change so if you have gotten something a while ago, they may have restyled it later on, ie the taiyaki. Always a decent choice to have lunch I have been coming to Fins for 5 years! The best sushi rolls with the most fish for your dollar. Wouldn\u2019t get sushi anywhere else. Food:  The curried puff and crab rangoon appetizers were outstanding, 10/10!  The mee nam with chicken was also delicious and satisfying for a cold and rainy night.  It was a large portion and took half of it home to enjoy the next day.  The Thai iced tea was also very tasty.\n\nAtmosphere:  Quiet, low-key, and cozy dining room.\n\nService:  Outstanding, friendly, attentive service and all of the food came quickly. Typical Neighborhood Thai spot in Beacon Hill.\n\nOver the past few months, I\u2019ve been coming to King & I for occasional Thai food cravings. The restaurant offers a comfortable and no-frills setting that mirrors many Thai eateries. While it primarily caters to delivery service, dining in offers a cozy experience.\n\nFrom the appetizers, I had the Boneless Barbecue Spareribs, which was essentially pork tenderloin pieces immersed in a honey and spice-infused sweet chili sauce. However, the pork was slightly overcooked and the sweet chili sauce was overpowering.\n\nThe entree experience was slightly better. My favorite so far was the Roast Duck Choo Chee. The duck, though slightly on the drier side, was redeemed by the curry sauce and the mushrooms and peppers. Similarly, the crispy chicken that came with Pad Thai was too thinly sliced and dry, but the noodles were decent.\n\nAnother satisfying dish was the Seafood Royale. A medley of garlic shrimp, scallops, squid, and vegetables, the dish offered a balanced flavor profile - not overly spicy but still sufficiently zesty.\n\nBeing the sole Thai restaurant in West End and Beacon Hill area, King & I dutifully serves its purpose: offering solid Thai food. While I\u2019m not sure if I would go back, it\u2019s still a reliable choice if you\u2019re looking for a quick Thai meal. First n foremost I just wanna say that our waitress was one of the kindest people I\u2019ve ever met :) so so sweet and made the experience that much better. The food was alright, it lacked some flavor and was kind of westernized. I wish the papaya salad was spicy, which is how it usually is. The cashew chicken wasn\u2019t very flavorful either. The soup was nice though! The place itself is cozy and cute. Surprised to find an original taste Thai restaurant in the middle of Boston:) The food was very well prepared and super tasty. The hot and sour soup I highly recommend. Freshly made, hot to perfection and very balanced in taste. I ate the pad Thai with chicken on top and it was the best one I have ever tried. The chicken with cashews was also very good. Highly recommended place. Good food. Friendly staff. Would recommend the Pad Thai for comfort and Panang Curry for a more hearty bite, though I wish it had broccoli/cauliflower instead of eggplant as that would enhance the flavor. Place has been around for a long time which is really neat. For those that don\u2019t want to wait for a table at the main Cafe Luna for brunch, this place delivers fantastic food! It\u2019s quick yet relaxed. The French toast though \ud83e\udd24 ordered the kitchen sink and it was great, couldn\u2019t finish it all. Best espresso in East Cambridge by a good  margin!\n\nThe vibe inside is perfect for a morning routine: calm, delightful music choices, friendly staff who really get to know the regulars \u2014 but still moving fast to get you on your way.\n\nFavorite foods include homemade corn beef hash, salmon omelette, and my kids love the Nutella French toast.\n\nThe only way this place could be better would be to serve mimosas at the weekend brunch! We were looking for a brunch spot and this cafe was right across the street from where we attended church. It's like it was meant to be. The \"kitchen sink\" was spot on if you're famished. The lemon curd blueberry FT was delectable. Came with choice of protein, eggs, and a side of fruit. The corned beef omelet was also a good choice for a hearty appetite. Cozy, charming atmosphere. Efficient service. Friendly staff. If I lived in Cambridge, this would be my go to Cafe. 4.3 stars for Little Luna shows how underappreciated they are. The food quality is much better than its peers, and the price point more reasonable. I find most of the staff to be great people, and very accommodating to their customer base. The inside of the place is beautiful, and the rest rooms are always so clean. No trendy gimmicks and over inflated prices like Flour, no. Just high quality food made on site. Derrick does a great job as the manager, too. This place is truly slept on. Wake the up people! Went here for breakfast on a Sunday soon after it opened. It wasn't too crowded. I would imagine that it would get crowded later in the morning.The food was excellent and large portions. If you are looking for a great breakfast restaurant- you should certainly try this restaurant - you will not be disappointed. Has anyone else gotten sick from their salads lately? Last week I ordered harvest bowls on two separate days and afterwards I felt extremely nauseous with bad stomach pain lasting until the next day. I\u2019m afraid to try a third time until Sweetgreen can confirm nothing is contaminated. This create your own salad bowl was outstanding! Not bad on the price either, less than 15$. The store was a little dirty. They had plenty of seating available though. The beets were not cooked that long, very hard. The service was a bit slow. Would definitely go back absolutely for the food. Walked into the store and decided to order something for me and a friend through the app  and then I  needed to use the restroom, I walked up and politely asked to use the restroom to the man behind the counter when I was ignored. I assumed maybe I said it too quietly and he didn\u2019t hear me so I asked again and still received not even a glance up in my direction. So I went and waited by the register and was ignored for a third time. Not even acknowledging my existence. So I proceeded to ask the next employee and was ignored and then a third employee. At this point i walked out leaving behind almost $40 worth of overpriced salads because i could only assume i was a ghost. So I\u2019ll make sure that my presence is never seen at a sweetgreen again and I\u2019ll file a chargeback in the morning Had an awesome lunch with my family while visiting my daughter in Boston. She brought us the sweetgreen because it's one of her favorite spots near her apartment and it didn't disappoint.\n\nAll the food was very fresh and very tasty. It may seem expensive at first but portion size is immense. The menu has some very creative items and add-ons. Their dressings are fantastic for these salads as well.\n\nAll the employees were very helpful and patient with us and the restaurant was very clean and you can even see into the back and it's all immaculate.\n\nWe were very impressed and will definitely be back. I agree their ingredients are fresh. However,  I paid $23 for a Cobb Salad with chicken added, a rosemary focaccia bread and a spindrift soda. This is my salad \u2639 not much to it.. The manager of that beautiful establishment is rude. I've been buying my coffee there for years. The staff recognizes me, but I'll never go back. Ordered Frozen coffee, the got the Frozen chocolate\u2026. Talked nice to the guy at register, who also  makes my drink\u2026   They are not admitted they did wrong\u2026 and don\u2019t want correct / exchange another\u2026. Never come back.  Those guy worked on Tuesday night, 12/17/2024 should get fired. The staff is nice , but don\u2019t order a hott chocolate they make it with water and it\u2019s gross . Second time I asked for them to make it with whole milk and still tasted water down . It\u2019s disgusting I think the lady made it with water again and added a pump of milk she didn\u2019t understand the concept . Ughhh waste of money I said my order 3 times and he did not understand I wanted mocha? I corrected him while he was making it because he rang it up wrong. I was asked if I wanted cream cheese in my bagel or on the side and I said on. It was on the side anyways. Also the cream cheese expired 2 months ago. Ordered an espresso shot and the man working the register didn't know what that was.\n\nAfter he checked with another employee, they served me a spiced cookie coffee with vanilla.\n\nI did not get a chance to complain since the employee had put his headphones in. This is the worst Dunkin\u2019s. The line is always sooooo long from 6am-10am. Mobile orders always still have to wait in line even if I order 15-20 minutes early. They need to have 2 staff members working here in the morning. Pointless location. They don\u2019t have anything besides donuts and coffee.  The manager is the worst. The cashiers look miserable but I bet it is because of the low pay (can\u2019t blame them), they still gave me a good customer service. Can\u2019t say the same for the manager though. She took my order once and I had to read her badge twice because I couldn\u2019t believe she was the manager. Almost hidden, so it can be hard to find, which after going there doesn't seem like such a bad thing. The staff were rude, it's very cramped as it's stuffed inside another store, and they don't participate in any specials a normal Dunkin Donuts would. Better off going somewhere else. One would think a coffee shop could make coffee instead of just pouring coffee. I ordered a medium iced coffee with two turbo shots,  1 cream  3 sugars.  But it was not properly made and ended up watery.  Ice goes in at the end not at the beginning.  Coffee was disgusting. Already in T station had to throw out instead of getting a good coffee. I will not be returning. Tiny Dunkins without many of the food items of the larger stores. It's mostly just for coffee and donuts, with a few muffin choices.\n\nThe best part of this Dunkies is Syeda, who is always smiling and friendly, and who often has your coffee ready before you reach the counter. I'm happy to see her as part of my daily coffee runs. Thanks Syeda! The food was amazing, the service was top-notch, and the atmosphere was both relaxing and stylish, with beautiful hotel decor. Our server was fantastic, and the meal came out quickly after we ordered. Even though the restaurant is right by the hotel lobby, it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful most of the time. I loved the kale salad as a healthy option! Plus, there are plenty of plant-based dishes on the menu. We dined at Peregrine before heading to a show later that night. It was a Friday and the restaurant\u2019s atmosphere was extremely quiet despite being half full. We didn\u2019t mind this, but I\u2019m pointing it out as other photos & reviewers seem to indicate a more lively atmosphere. Because of the way the hotel & restaurant are laid out, it definitely still feels like a hotel restaurant (which may or may not be the atmosphere you\u2019re looking for!)\n\nThe food and drinks were pretty good, definitely better than a lot of hotel restaurant food. We got the mackerel + eggplant and chicken + potatoes. The eggplant was notably quite good. The chicken was well seasoned and cooked well.\n\nPrice seemed fair for downtown Boston at a slightly upscale establishment. I appreciated that tips were already built into the bill (both as a consumer and as someone who believes in staff being paid fair wages).\n\nAll in all pleased. Thanks Peregrine team! We were staying at the hotel and felt like having a snack at Peregrine. We were waiting for an outdoor table in the backyard. But due to miscommunication we were seated outdoor by the street. Josh, one of the staff, was very apologetic about this and offered us complementary snacks. Such a kind gesture. The outdoor seating was actually quite nice. People watching and nice weather we\u2019re a good combo. Anyway, we ordered gazpacho and Sicilian pizza, both of which were great! Our server Lily was very attentive and friendly. When we saw the bill, it says \u201cPeregrine is a full-wage restaurant. Gratuities, while appreciated, are absolutely not expected.\u201d A sign of an establishment that treats their employees very well. We would definitely recommend this place! Updated review (2024): I'm sadden to write that the food quality has significantly gone down over the last year. In each of our last visits the taste was just okay. In our last visit, three out of four meals were bad or mediocre, particularly the roasted chichen: it was salty and came with almost no sauce\u2014it no longer looked/tasted like the one from my original review.\n\nOriginal review: Excellent ambiance, food, and service are some of the highlights of Peregrine, one of the best restaurants in Beacon Hill and Boston. Peregrine pleasantly combines a quiet and artistic atmosphere with an amazing\u2014and reasonably priced\u2014menu. I have dinned at Peregrine more than ten times and in each case the quality of the food was superb, and the meal options are always unique. In fact, they not only have a seasonal menu but also an optional fixed-course menu.\n\nA hidden perk of dinning here is that Peregrine is a full-wage restaurant, meaning that tips are neither necessary nor expected! Definitely an upscale atmosphere, with lovely decor and an outside courtyard dining area as well. An intimate yet open space, it\u2019s great for a date, night to catch up with old friends or a business meeting.\n\nFor a place this fancy, I would\u2019ve expected better quality food - I ordered the Paella di Alghero: The shrimp was overcooked and tough, and there wasn\u2019t anythting special about the flavor of the dish.\n\nMy other complaint is the slow service and wait time for the food. It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out. However, they were very on top of never leaving our water glasses empty which is a huge plus for me, personally.\n\nGreat atmosphere and interior design, but would not come again because for the price you pay, the quality of the food wasn\u2019t amazing/worth it. One of my go-to spots for sweet lattes and seasonal drinks.\n\nWhen Blank Street first launched a few years ago, one of their core missions was to serve affordable coffee. With minimal brick-and-mortar stores and very limited seating, they cut costs wherever they could to keep prices low. Fast forward a few years, and that mission seems to have gotten lost in the brew\u2014the coffee here is now as expensive as Blue Bottle. But I\u2019m not complaining. Their drinks, especially the seasonal lattes, are some of my favorites in the city.\n\nMy go-to drink from their regular menu is the Shaken Brown Sugar Cold Brew\u2014just the right amount of sweetness to kickstart my day. From their seasonal offerings, I was a big fan of the Cherry Cold Brew Latte. The sweet, prominent cherry flavor blended perfectly with the latte. Their pastry selection is pretty basic, but here\u2019s a sweet deal: around closing time, they sometimes give out extra pastries. Last time I was there, I scored two sticky buns for the price of one. I came to visit an old friend of mine and she took me to this coffee shop. The girl who made my coffee, I think her name  is Aubri, made me the most beautiful cup of coffee I've ever tasted. The atmosphere was desirable, perfect place to catch up. Definitely going to be returning to this spot on my next visit. If I lived here this would be my morning destination, if I could I'd have Aubri make me coffee every morning. Recently moved to Boston and have been looking for a good coffee shop near my work. This place is it. Love the coffee, love the food, and I love the staff. Naomi is great. I love coming here to try that new Matcha latte and get advice from locals. Thanks again Naomi for the local insight. I will be coming back! I have been a regular at Blank Street for just shy of a year, and have absolutely loved this coffee shop. Every drink I have gotten has been consistently delicious and their rotating menu and season items ensures there is always something new to try.\nHowever, the real reason I keep coming back are the outstanding baristas. Sam has been a leader at the Cambridge St location - I often see her training newer hires, working long hours, and working flawlessly with everyone to provide the best experience for the customers. Sam is personable, professional, and has an overall positive attitude everyday. With baristas like Sam behind the counter, Blank Street will continue to grow their customer base and build their reputation in Boston! Thank you for everything, Sam! Was in Boston for the week and we always stopped by here early in the morning . We ordered their Pistachio latte and tried about every matcha they had available through the week. Would highly recommend this place if you haven\u2019t tried before. The best place for caffeine in the area. The baristas on shift were also super helpful and cheerful . Apparently they get offended if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s a mobile-only store and want to order in-person This place was renovated to a take out , grab and go place. No bathroom, no seats or tables. Very cold environment from what it used to be. If starbucks plans to do this to more stores, consider me an ex-customer. It's always nice to have the option to sit and drink coffee or be able to use the bathroom even if you plan to do a takeout order. Circumstances change.\n\nVery disappointed in the direction starbucks is going. If I wanted grab and go coffee I would go to Dunkins ,an affordable place like 7/11 or a convenience store. Easily the nicest staff of any Starbucks in the city. I used to go to Boylston on my morning walk but these guys always get my order quick and fast. A few of the baristas in here have the best energy and really pump me up for a day of work! The new pick-up, its freezing inside, very slow crew, and the guy whispers the name which is useless. SB has to do better since you swapped out full shop for this!!? Slow service, staff is not friendly, and did not have any gift cards. Won't go back to this pick-up version of Starbucks Love my BHP! Yea, it's not perfectly clean, it's not polished, but you can get a good cold beer, have some tv's to catch up on the sports latest, throw some darts, or even play some guitar hero!! Me and the S.O. have been coming here for a long while, having previously lived around the corner, and we still miss being able to come in.  If you're not pretentious or high maintenance, stop in for a good time.  Bartenders friendly! Fun spot for trivia, and good beers on tap. Don't go off of current information on their website. They advertise that \"Pizza's on us @ 8pm,\" but then didn't actually offer any food. Bartenders were incredibly rude and dismissive when we asked about info that was current on their website. Would have been fine if not advertised!! Not a bad place to pop in and get a beer or mixed drink.  Not sure of any food offerings as we only had a couple of drinks.  It smells like a bar but I am ok with that. This is a great place to grab drinks. I\u2019ve never had the food here. This is more of a dive bar sort of environment. It\u2019s cash only and they have an atm towards the front of the building. They have a loyal following and it can be busy (and fun) here on weekends. Definitely trying stopping in if you\u2019re ever in the area! Great bar dive bar right near the MBTA (Charles/MGH on the Red Line). I went on karaoke night which isn't typically my thing, but the drinks were affordable and the crowd was great. People seemed excited to be out and things seemed like they were back to normal. I was even convinced to hop on stage and perform and the crowd was very inviting and supportive. The karaoke DJ (I think his name was AJ) was also super cool, even throwing in harmonies and backing vocals during some of the songs! If you're looking for a cool dice car to relax, check this one out!"

    "reviews": "After the nail tech I had been seeing for 3+ years left the MiniLuxe I had been going to, I was having a difficult time finding an artist who could do my nails (shape specifically), the way I liked. I had my first appointment with Hanna and have never looked back. I've been seeing Hanna at the salon for about 6 months now and she is the best tech I've ever been to. I get gel overlay for short nails with design and Hanna crushes it every time. One set can last me 4-5 weeks without any chipping or damage. Highly recommend! I've been coming to see Anya for almost a year. My whole life I've never had any sort of retention after getting my nails done - everything chips, peels, lifts, etc after a week and a half to two weeks because my nails are very dry and brittle. With Anya, after she and I worked out what prep my nails need, all of my manicures consistently last 4+ weeks and I've never again had an issue. A gel overlay is expensive, but in my opinion you're getting very high quality for the price, and going regularly has changed the shape and length of my nails for the better. I\u2019ve been coming here for almost two years and I\u2019ve had issues in the past but always been resolved and always put up with everything even though they are ridiculously overpriced but this was my last straw. I wanted magnetic gel polish and found a color on the display nails they have that I really liked. Nail tech was rude per usual very passive aggressive but nothing I\u2019m not used to I put up with it because I usually happy with how my nails come out. They\u2019re notorious for charging $25 for French or chrome so I wasn\u2019t surprised when she said it would be an extra charge, but there\u2019s literally no design. I don\u2019t know if she knew what she was doing or not it definitely doesn\u2019t look like it because it looks like regular shiny polish. And with flash it looks worse some nails light some dark I would\u2019ve been better off just doing a regular shiny polish and not paying an extra $25 dollars especially when they\u2019re already charging $120 for a set of nails, and because I\u2019m not evil I tip always so in total this set of nails ran me a whopping $165 dollars. Straight robbery is what they\u2019re doing and all they could do is offer another coat of the same polish with no magnet so just shiny which should\u2019ve been free then. I\u2019m over giving this place my hard earned money for them to take advantage. If you\u2019re looking for another Russian manicure spot, She She nail studio in the North end! Better prices & better customer service and better nails! There is a reason they have 4.9 stars and and best nails Boston only has 3.6\nDon\u2019t come here!!! I\u2019ve tried a few different salons in Boston specializing in Russian/Ukrainian/Dry Manicure (whatever you prefer to call it) and I say in full confidence say this is the best, most consistent, and easiest nail salon to get to via public transport. I\u2019ve seen a few different artists at the studio and the work does fluctuate based off the artist. For over the past 6 months i\u2019ve been exclusively seeing Anya for my manicure. She does a great job, amazing attention to detail, and is just a pleasure to talk to. I always look forward to my appointments. You definitely dont need to go to the top artist at this salon to get a good manicure, the only difference is length of appointment. I get regular gel nails, no design, no extensions and with tip I usually pay roughly $130. The nails have lasted me up to four weeks (even five weeks if your nails grow back slowly). Ive gone to other salons where I\u2019ve paid a little less for the same product but my nails would lift and chip after a week or two, so in my mind this is the best deal! Mary does the best job with my nails! I\u2019ve never been somewhere that does such a thorough job and they last me at least 5 weeks. These were my nails for my wedding and bachelorette and Mary did an amazing job! I recently visited CVS Pharmacy with my 70-year-old mother for her scheduled vaccine appointment, and unfortunately, we had a very disappointing experience. Upon arrival, we were informed by the pharmacist that there were no vaccines left, despite the confirmed appointment. What made the situation worse was the pharmacist\u2019s rude and dismissive attitude. When we asked for her name, she refused to provide it, which felt unprofessional and disrespectful.\nThe Asian pharmacist needs more educations about her approach, an attitude. It  would have made a huge difference. Patients, especially elderly ones, deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. I hope CVS addresses this issue to improve customer service in the future. Touching basis for the whole store in one setting.\n\npharmacy is closed every day from 1:30-2 PM\nPharmacy 90% out of the time rushed and poor customer service etiquette in many ways. What ever is bothering them at work should never be brought on to the customers. The work load seems heavy but again, not the customers problems.\n\nWe should never see, deal, or sense animosity from any employee on to any customers. Yes some customers will back fire and mirror their behavior as the rudeness seems to be the custom here and yes many have health issues that don\u2019t allow customers to be patient. Many are sick, in pain, suffering some sort of health condition and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s 1-2 customers perhaps a day of that may be hard to tolerate.\n\nAs a pharmacy they should be practicing extreme patience and training with difficult situations.\n\nThere is one gentleman pharmacist that was very friendly with customers then I noticed a change in his personality. I can only guess that the jolly personality and CS ethic wasn\u2019t tolerated by other employees on the cvs grounds at Charles river plaza.\n\nI have helped more customers on the floor offering help or simply letting them know to flag me if they need help in particular to the elderly and or handicap. I have not seen any employee offer assistance without having to ring a bell.\n\nThey will completely act like you\u2019re not there. While stocking they don\u2019t move and have an attitude of you move their unattended cart. New people are always pleasant and eager to work but it doesn\u2019t last long. They disappear or become like the rest of the tired bothered employees.\n\nThis CVS is the most expensive CVS I\u2019ve seen in the city of Boston. Price gouging much.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into the rude lady that\u2019s been there for like 100 years in the front everyone knows who I\u2019m talking about. After several years watching her be rood to many new employees and customers including my self I couldn\u2019t tolerate her any longer and just passed forward her vibes right back at her.\n\nShe will go from mainly rood 99% of the time but on that 1% you might catch her trying. I have to be honest there is a woman with short curly hair that is sweet and helpful at the self checkout along with one gentleman men at self checkout.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t the convenience of location I definitely would not go there anymore. Once I can travel after surgery I will relocate for sure. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIf you consistently use this location I feel certain that you know what I\u2019m saying and the once in a blue maybe. Their photo center may be fast but the quality is poor. The online template might show everything looking perfect and centered and nothing being cut off but once it prints you\u2019ll have an uneven white line on one side of all your photos and the edges of your pictures cut off. Automatically scheduled a flu vaccine on my behalf without my consent or approval. Obviously they\u2019re benefitting from somehow or padding their vaccine stats to look good for corporate. Either way it\u2019s shady behavior and unacceptable. DO NOT USE THIS PHARMACY! I had the most unpleasant experience with the technician and pharmacist (Laura). They are always rude, disrespectful, and tactless, but this was the worst experience yet. I was berated in the store because CVS overworks their employees. This is unacceptable, and I will not be returning to any CVS. I live an hour from the city! This Whole Foods is such a delightful place to shop, have an espresso or snack, and relax! In an area well known for parking difficulties this Whole Foods has its own lot! Paid parking but not bad if you are validated! Nice tables to eat at inside and out! Hot and cold buffets with lots of choices. Super clean rest room! Always try to stop here when visiting Mass General. Pretty easy from highways. Food is super fresh and very nicely presented.

This Whole Foods near Mass General is fantastic! The store is always clean, well-organized, and easy to navigate. Their selection of locally made products is impressive, featuring fresh bread, craft beverages, and unique snacks from New England. The produce is fresh, and the hot bar has great meal options. Staff is friendly and helpful, making shopping a great experience. One of the best Whole Foods locations in Boston! Super solid Whole Foods experience. Went here while on a work trip and I was pleasantly surprised. The store is much bigger than it appears in the outside. Kind of interesting. They separate the wellness and beauty products from the grocery store stealth but it kind of gives you a separate little experience.\n\nThe hot and salad bar were incredibly clean well stocked around lunchtime. They had a ton of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. It was all very organized as well. Their selection and desserts were also quite well stocked.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 space was a little messy and chaotic, but I found a spot. So organized and so many wonderful options! Quick stop for some snacks and drinks, but I was happy to find the hot bar and a seating area so I could eat them there and not walk and eat! Terrible service, do not trust their hours posted online or on the door. I arrived at 3:45 PM to find their doors locked and their staff waving me away. As per their signage and their own schedule, they are open until 4 PM. I only would have asked to withdraw some money in quarters, which would have taken a couple of minutes. This makes me want to leave BoA. This was the worst experience I have had thus far with banking. I went in yesterday to open a checking and savings account. I am 10 hours away from where I used to live but recently moved. My mother who is on my account has access to closing and writing a cashier's check. So, I had her do just that as recommended BY the associate. I asked the associate SPECIFICALLY if it would be okay to deposit a certain amount. He said something to the extent of, \"Yes, no problem people do a lot more\". So, my mom went and CLOSED my account, but when she used the app to deposit the check it wouldn't let her and said it exceeded the amount. The closest Bank of America to her is 2-3 hours away. She also works as a nurse and doesn't have time to drive 2-3 hours there and back. That is time and money some don't have. My case is time-sensitive as I have to pay rent and other bills. They need to educate their associates to better assist customers and provide accurate and truthful information. My mom is going to try to do prioritized mailing, but that's more money and time we shouldn't have had to spend. Nice service with my agent, Rosalis pimentel, for my bank of America is the best bank I went there today and Jullien took care of me. He was extremely helpful, polite, and friendly. He addressed all of my questions and concerns (and I had a lot of them) without any hesitation. Also, he made sure that we don\u2019t leave without having all of our issues completely resolved. This is one of the best experiences that I had at any Bofa centers in MA. Also, Michael, the manager and the associate manager in this location were extremely helpful and professional. I highly recommend that you book your next visit at this financial center! Love the service, very nice and helpful. Thank you! I\u2019ve been at pro-optical for years and have had Dr. Kublin the entire time.  I am very satisfied with his car of my eyes. He\u2019s genuinely a nice guy. I just picked up my new eyeglasses glasses and the optician I worked with Linda rightfully so convinced me to go with different glasses (always pick the same \u201cold lady\u201d type. I am so glad I listened to her advice and let her take charge.  Thank you! I have been a valued customer of Pro Optical since 2011. I am always greeted with a warm smile. A friendly , Hello! Their professional in their approach. Their very knowledgeable and respectfull. Their advice can be trusted and valued. Best new glasses ever! Brianna picked out the frames--was sweet but firm that my choices were dull. I turned her loose and what a good thing that was. My new desk specs, the ones I will be wearing for zoom meetings and skyping, are DAZZLING. So modern and fun and not old-ladyish like the ones I would have chosen. And a very good value. I'll be back for other glasses. I saw Dr. Andrew Rabkin today for an initial vist for contact lenses and an eye exam, and he was absolutely fantastic! As a physician, I have extremely high standards in other healthcare providers, and Dr. Rabkin exceeded them. Really appreciated his excellent care. Dr. Bao-Kim Nguyen was incredibly thorough and punctual. I went in for dry eyes and vision changes. Hardly waited at all and got all my questions answered and great treatment recommendations. She was so empathetic too. I finally didn't feel like just another copay to collect. Been going to this chap for years. Both alterations and dry cleaning. Always happy with the work and cost. I absolutely love this place! Turnaround time for alterations is fast and reasonably priced. The owner has even saved me money a time or two giving me fantastic guidance to save a garment instead of charging me for something easy that I could do myself (which I appreciated tremendously).  The owner is just an all-around great man. I am so happy to have this small business in my community. Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4c The experience shows. The gentlemen treated me like his son and patched up my winter parka with water resistant fabric that matched the navy color exactly, all in record time. He also dry cleaned my suit with excellent care. 10/10 would recommend for all your dry cleaning, tailoring, and altering needs! Awesome service truly justifies the name. The owner is very helpful and polite. Dropped off a 3 piece suit and shirt to be dry cleaned.  Took a week, but I wasn't in a rush.  Reasonable prices.  Cash only, so make sure you know how much it'll be when you drop off your items.\n\nI had forgotten my ticket but I did take a photo of it, so there was no problems on pick up. Been looking for a new dry cleaning spot and after trying some around Boston area, I decided to venture out and found my new spot Charles Street Cleaners. They are very helpful and SUPER nice. I'll never go any where else after experiencing their awesome service. My friend is absolutely in love with their alterations on her dresses. Everything comes out as good as new and Iam recommending them to all my friends. Not those franchise dry cleaners. A local dry cleaners owned by small business owners who TRULY take good care of your garments and do an amazing job. The lady is also a professional alterer with 30+ years of experience, so if you are looking for a trusworthy cleaners this is your place. For 3 blazers and one dress they were going to charge me $98! Avoid at all costs, take your stuff somewhere else Superior Tailoring and Dry Cleaning Services at Competitive Rates!  I have always had a great experience at Charles Street Cleaners!  They offer the best alterations in all of Boston. Saved the day for my daughter! We need an urgent alteration, and of course she made it happen! We were there for a birthday brunch. The food, service and atmosphere are 5 stars. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for so it's worth the few $$$ you spend. Not a good place for young children but I assume it could be a good atmosphere for a romantic dinner date. Maybe the chef was just having a bad day, but honestly, the whole experience felt like it was from a 2-star hotel restaurant.\nHow do you overcook Eggs Benedict\u2014twice? The food tasted almost pre-prepared. When I sent back my first plate, the server didn\u2019t apologize, and a replacement arrived in just five minutes.\nOn the bright side, the vibe and the decor were nice. So, if you're looking for a cute spot with overpriced, mediocre food\u2014like $28 overcooked Eggs Benedict (before tax and tip)\u2014this is the place for you. Nice ambiance with plenty of natural light coming through the semi-clear ceiling, which adds to the atmosphere. The food was decent\u2014I enjoyed my lobster roll and the starter bread. Would visit again. This place was great! We made a reservation but we had to wait a few extra minutes for our table to be ready. To apologize they offered us a complimentary round of mimosas! Additionally, the food was amazing and perfectly cooked and the atmosphere was very classy. Highly recommend!! Had a hotel credit for food and was happy I did! The location and atmosphere can\u2019t be beat. This renovated banks makes an exceptional location for brunch and food in downtown Boston. Prices are high, but the experience is definitely worth it. My friend got food poisoning after eating a type of bagel sandwich here (pictured across my soup). My soup was pretty good. Service isn't amazing, but the place is in a good location close to MGH. Bagel was good, I thought it tasted somewhat sweet. The metallic look of restaurant was appealing, prices fair, service fair. An opportunity to get bagels when you are on a schedule. While the quality isn\u2019t going to smack you in the face, its consistency and quickness is something to be admired. The restaurant is well located but there are many major problems. The complimentary milk for coffee has flies, MANY flies, all over the restaurant, there was a hair in my food and meat and avocado were not fresh, it even tasted bitter. Employees aren\u2019t wearing a mask, even if they are cooking, they have no respect for covid restrictions, and the cashier is rude! It wouldn\u2019t survive any sanitary inspection. One of my favorite bagel spots when I went to Boston. Great place, love the lox! We had a great experience in jail for dinner on my birthday :-) My wife surprised me with the evening out; she had to spill the surprise because I was going to get into town before she was, so I arrived at the Liberty for the first time with no idea where I was going. Despite the subtle signs that Scampo was to my left I knew I had an hour to kill, so I followed the escalators up towards the live music (as I will ALWAYS do). They opened out into a broad atrium bar - The Clink, I take it - where a very skilled trio was laying down jazz standards. One Hendricks G&T and several standards later (including a particularly funky Green Dolphin Street) I realized it was our reservation time, so I made my way down to find Scampo.\n\nI was ushered in to a cozy - yet prison basement - dining space with lovely decor and a buzz of attentive hosts. I wouldn\u2019t have called it a \u201cfamily\u201d restaurant, but right next to me was a table with a mom and her 2-3 year old in a high chair\u2026 a very well mannered kid from all evidence. Our server Juan was fantastic, knowledgeable about the menu and drinks, friendly and authentic. My wife arrived shortly before our tuna tartare which was delicious, though served with too few taro chips (Juan promptly took care of that for us). The seafood we each ordered was terrific - the plates were all scraped clean, garnishes and all - and the cocktails were interesting and well made.\n\nWhile we didn\u2019t have room for dessert my wife more or less insisted, since she had checked ahead of time and discovered there was a particular chocolate confection that she thought I would like. I did. It was supposed to have cone with a candle and sparkler, she told me, but it was just as tasty without, and it too vanished completely.\n\nExcellent evening all told: good food, good drink, good music, good company. Thanks for a great birthday venue Scampo (and Clink)! We enjoyed the most amazing experience at Scampo!\nWe were celebrating my son\u2019s private wedding.\nThe warm and welcoming atmosphere with it\u2019s rich velvet chairs and magnificent lighting presented such a comforting and classy environment without being pretentious.\nOur event coordinator, Carah was extremely communicative and went above and beyond and was very flexible in helping to facilitate a memorable, intimate event. She aided in creating a menu to entice all despite the food challenges which were presented.\nOur servers, Holly and Pedro were friendly, patient, and professional while offering expert recommendations.\nLast but not least, kudos to the chefs for preparing an exquisite meal that was not only delectable but visually beautiful as well.\nI highly recommend Scampo to anyone looking for a remarkable experience! Not quite up at top level, it\u2019s Christmas season, but service is way too slow, 45 minutes between apps and mains?? Pork chop ordered medium rare and served almost well done, seasonings either too heavy or too little? But the Lobster Pizza, definitely tops for #1. Interesting Italian restaurant with a Mediterranean and Middle Eastern spin that\u2019s sit in a former prison. The staff was professional and attentive especially with the size of the party. The team did great. The cocktails were tasty and refreshing. The oxtail pizza was unique and had tons of flavor. The clam pasta was presented very well but way too dry for my liking. Authentic.   Great place for dinner.  Everything from the food to the service is brilliant.  I let the bartender order for me, and considering how often I eat out... this place is a stand-out.  Think about it....when was the last time you had homemade Pecan Cake?  And, it was spectacular.   Do not miss this place if you have the chance.

Think about it....when was the last time you had homemade Pecan Cake?  And, it was spectacular.   Do not miss this place if you have the chance. This place changed my mind about donuts. I have only ever thought they are okay until I tried Blackbird.\n\nI've only been here twice but I loved it.\n\nWe were surprised to discover later that the first two donuts we got were vegan. I've had great vegan food before but desserts are often lacking. Not so with these donuts.\n\nThe lemon glazed donut was so tart and perfect. We also loved the chocolate mousse bismark. Of course not every flavor is mind blowing but the overall quality really is phenomenal. I love the variety of flavors and that these pastries are not way too sweet like most typical donuts I have had.\n\nIt's pricey, so take your time choosing. I didn\u2019t even like donuts until I tried the Boston cream donut from Blackbird. Now I randomly crave donuts at 8 pm when they\u2019ve already closed and I have to (impatiently) wait until the next morning. Anyway - these are the best, softest donuts I\u2019ve ever had and you have to try them too. Plus the staff is super friendly and the coffee is great! As a donut conneiseur who's tried my fair share of pastries, this shop lives up to the hype! At $42/dozen it should! However the price point is actually reflected in the taste and that is something I have found lacking in some hyped up places (Kanes which was so disappointing). I can't even say I had a favorite for what we tried: cannoli, tiramisu, eggnog, jelly filled and Boston cream. If you twisted my arm I may say eggnog! The Boston cream was definitely the best of it's kind I've ever had. If you're looking for the best donut shop in Boston this is it. This particular location is a bit small and offers no indoor seating just fyi. Good donuts but hardly worth the price tag. Got a half dozen donuts including ice cream cake, Boston cream, black bird, and mango swirl. I liked how they didn't put too much sugar for their fillings, but overall the doughnuts weren't phenomenal as some people described. The doughs for the regular donuts (not brioche) were chewy and less greasy which made them taste healthy, but I wasn't a huge fan. I used to defend Blackbird as good even if they weren\u2019t my favorite donut in town, but no more. I had a maple braid a few days ago, and it was even less maple flavored than Dunks (let alone other places with a comparable price point). Add on an unremarkable texture with a bit too much grease and it\u2019s 1 star for the price for me. I give them a second star for trying some innovative flavors, but I\u2019m not eager to go back."

    "reviews": "This is unreal! USPS is open till 12 a.m. and open on Sunday. And plenty of parking spots in the center of downtown Boston. I first read the review on Google, and they said this USPS really opens till midnight and you won\u2019t have any issues finding a parking spot. I was not sure and could not believe it at first, but it is real! The staff is also friendlier than at other USPS locations. 5/5! A worker was very rude and belittling to a customer who was just trying to buy stamps, the customer had given this worker the money for the stamps and the lady took the money without giving the lady stamps. when the lady asked for her money back the lady kept saying no. she kept calling the woman stupid and telling her to couldn\u2019t do math, and it was very offensive to talk to a woman who\u2019s first language is obviously not english all this. she made the woman cry and the manager gave the lady her 100 dollars back, leaving the poor old lady crying. The worker was unremorseful and went with no warning for yelling at the woman then refusing her service. A tracking number letter. Had a letter get to this location for Boston Delivery.2/17\nWas fowarded to Raintree Ma, 2/17\nTo Weston Ma, 2/18\nTo Middle Essex/Essex 2/19\nBACK to Boston. 2/20,\nTHEN:\nTo Nashua N.H. 2/21\nCALLED THE BOSTON  OFFICE, Their response?\n\"We dont know where it is??? Although its Been to Boston twice?\nAvoid this location. They don\u2019t address any issues and seem completely unqualified, including the branch manager. Their only concern is to get rid of you as quickly as possible. I recommend using other postal service providers. Great location right off Summer St.\nAlong the harbor\n\nEasy to walk to /find with great signage.\n\nCute spring decor up to welcome guests and patrons at the entrance/exit\n\nThe worker/cashier at the desk was a bit sassy with me when responding to my question (maybe she was having a bad day?) but other than that it was a nice location. All 7 Eleven are no longer 24/7. Please don\u2019t waste your time even at 6am. And 7 Eleven please save your \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound right...\u201d response. You been doing that for over 2 years now with no change to your hours online or in store. You are still claiming you are 24/7 on Google and other platforms after many people have told you that stores aren\u2019t open overnight or early morning anymore. This is both inconsiderate to customers and false advertisement. Go to West End Market. There not 24 hours but at least their hours listed are honest and reliable and that is why small businesses are still winning.\nI took a vow not to shop at 7 Eleven any more after all the time they made me waste and you shouldn\u2019t either. This is dangerous for women to go outside late or early morning only not to be able to get what you need. 7 Eleven please save your response that you been giving us since Covid started! It is sincerely getting old! All I say is Excuses, Excuses, Excuses. Your just showing us all that Big Businesses get away with with no consequences. In this whole time, you haven\u2019t got sued not even once for false advertisement. Let that be a small business, it would be a whole different story. Great store! Very convenient location and friendly staff! Best in the area! This 7-Eleven allows people to use stolen credit cards who buy gift cards for thousand dollars without checking IDs. Will you go and try to talk to them? They\u2019re belligerent and angry so they know  Exactly what\u2019s going on? Says its open 24/7 but was closed. A friend was having an allergic reaction so we went here for medicine just to find out they were closed. Horrible. This one is also not 24/7. Why are we lying like this? Put up your real hours I am extremely disappointed with the carpet cleaning services at American Dry Cleaners. Firstly, they said that my carpet was going to need a \"special\" cleaning because of the leather backing and overcharged me.\n\nI receive the carpet and was very upset. The leather backing is completely ruined and I have multiple RIPS in the carpet (pictures attached). I go back and kindly ask for a full refund since they damaged my carpet and the staff was rude and refused to give it to me, saying that I am trying to \"harm\" their business. They only gave me half off because they gave it to a third-party cleaning service (which I was unaware of) and I had to go through another 1-2 week process for this other service to inspect it, with no promise of a refund. I am not going back here for any services. DO NOT COME HERE!!! Horrible experience. I brought 3 pairs of pants to be hemmed. All three came back with different lengths on the right and left legs. All extremely noticeable. The sewing job is careless and jagged with frayed thread. When I picked up they were covered in pink marker. I asked if it would come out she said if you iron or wash it should. Incredibly unprofessional. These were expensive pairs of jeans so it will now cost me more to fix them or try to fix them. I've used this business for clothing alterations several times and, unfortunately, I don't think I can ever come back; It is overpriced AND, most recently, they did a sloppy job and made my jeans much smaller than agreed upon!!!! I\u2019ve gotten three items altered or fix here so far and both times I have been really happy. The woman is very nice and I always have a good time talking to her. Reasonable prices too and quick turnaround time. She replaced a zipper for me entirely and it looks flawless, it looked like nothing had even been changed or replaced and it fit the shirt perfectly. This place is great! Very rude staff. I brought my jeans to get mended and not only was the stitching abysmal but it caused my jeans to rupture at a different spot in the fabric! Really disappointed. Be sure to avoid this place. The old woman you have working here tells everyone that comes in the door it's cheaper to buy somewhere else and tries to get people to leave and buy at other stores . I have now seen it 3 times in the last week . I tried buying a soda and she was trying to tell me no buy ot at 7 11 cheaper. That's not okay I'm in the store trying to buy things and she would rather tell people to go else where than ring someone up for product they want to buy this woman should be fired . I can't even imagine how much money she's made you loose. She's telling customers to buy somewhere else.  Absolutely disgusted by the way she talked to me. the guy who's at the counter, that looks like the lollipop kids from the wizard of oz,  is a complete rude jackass!! go to Simmons down the street for friendly service. This liquor stores hours are unreliable. I was there at 9:50 am and they were closed. The gentlemen working today was so horrible about it and let me know he had to run errands and if he chose not to open that he could do that. He was so rude about being late to open today. All I said was he should change his hours on Google and he took this to heart and said he doesn\u2019t have to open at all. In the future I will not be coming to this liquor store! The absolute worse! Liquor Stores in Boston open at 9am and close at 11 pm. Not this liquor store! They open when they want and decide to close at 10 pm. Avoid this place at all cost! Don\u2019t go here, I was refused service because my ID apparently didn\u2019t run in their system despite the fact that I am 22 years old and have a real, non-expired ID. Go to Simmons instead, they are much nicer staff seem nice enough, but this afternoon I stopped in for a lemonade & was charged $4.50. It seemed a bit expensive for such a small bottle, but it was hot & I was thirsty. Got back to my room in the hotel across the street and saw that the sticker on the cap says $2.50. I was too tired and it was too muggy to go back and ask what the deal was. But I\u2019m staying across the street for a week & they\u2019ve lost my business ... I've been here for many years, at least 3 times a week, and they decided to cover the protein section with a metal plate, I talked to the manager and said that it is a merchant decition related with the chain, just letting you know that I'm not coming back again until you uncover it. What are you hiding? Are the portions different? Really nice location, employees helped me find my sandwich choice and were quick and efficient! Awful. I come in at 9:15 pm on Wednesday may 22 and I am told they are closed. Mind the doors are unlocked and the food is still out and had just started putting it away. He was very disrespectful and I\u2019ve never seen such awful service from subway in my life. Worst subway in the world and will not ever be returning. I hope he gets fired \u2026 why would the doors be open if they were closed and it wasn\u2019t 10pm. That subway must be loosing money like crazy if this is what happens coming from a former manager myself this is unexceptionable Great customer service, lots of laughs and smiles. Always love going to Subway for a good nightcap chocolate chip cookie. Don\u2019t forget to warm it up! Churro was not great. Will not be going back. Wanted to get a philly and the workers just looked at me like I had 3 eyes and ended up getting LOTS of attitude. Got out with a ham and cheese sandwich that I didn't even ask for. Employees clearly don't know what they are doing and don't care. If you are looking for subs, go to Pizza Shuttle down the street\u2013 they are local, fair priced AND will give a damn! DO NOT waste your time here like I did. Had a great time at Tip Tap! The atmosphere was lively and welcoming, perfect for a night out with friends. The beer selection was impressive, with a nice mix of local brews and unique options you don\u2019t find everywhere. We ordered a few small plates to share\u2014everything was tasty, especially the sliders and truffle fries.\n\nService was solid overall, though it did take a little while to get our drinks at first. That said, our server was friendly and checked in often once things picked up. The vibe is definitely more on the energetic side, so maybe not the best for a quiet dinner, but ideal if you\u2019re looking for a fun evening.\n\nWould definitely come back! On a beautiful day with the garage doors open, this place has a great atmosphere. Service was great. Draught list was great, food was top tier. Always wanted to come here to sit near the massive open windows and people watch. Glad I finally did it. The environment is electric.\n\nFood was standard American but well seasoned. Lamb burger and calamari were fantastic.\n\nSlight ding for the service. The waiter mixed up my order with another table. Fortunately, the mistake was corrected with no fuss. SURPRISE!  This place was great.  Vibe was fun, service excellent, my steak tips were awesome.  I thought this was a bar, but it\u2019s a super restaurant.  Packed with people, fun time and great eats! When you go to a place called The Tip Tap Room, you\u2019re probably going there for something very specific\u2026 maybe Tips? Or maybe Tap (beer)\u2026 what you\u2019re probably not going there for is brunch.\n\nAfter three months of trying to schedule a time with family to go to The Tip Tap Room, the day had finally arrived! It was Saturday, March 30, at 1:30, and we were hungry for TIPS!!! We were surprised to find the place virtually empty, but hey, that just meant more TIPS for us. Imagine our shock when we were seated and handed a brunch menu.\n\nNo big deal, I thought\u2014I\u2019ll just ask for the dinner menu. Surely, they\u2019d prefer I purchase higher-priced items at lunchtime, thus giving the restaurant more revenue. Alas, it was not to be. The host told me, with absolute certainty, that brunch was the only meal they were serving and that tips would not be available until the evening. However, if I wanted, I could order appetizers off the dinner menu\u2014but not tips. So, we pivoted. We agreed we would order TAPS (beer) and apps and figured we\u2019d decide what to do about a main meal after that.\n\nHere\u2019s where the fun begins. We sat and waited\u2026 and waited\u2026 and waited for a server to bring drinks, apps, or at the very least, to say HELLO. Alas, once again, it was not meant to be. After ten minutes of being completely ignored, we decided to leave\u2014without a hello, without tips, and without taps.\n\nOn the way out, the very same host who had seated us cheerfully said, \u201cHave a nice day,\u201d apparently unaware\u2014or unconcerned\u2014that we hadn\u2019t been there long enough to enjoy so much as a sip of beer or a single bite of food.\n\nI have no idea how the tips or taps are at The Tip Tap Room, and unfortunately, I won\u2019t be going back to find out. I am currently at the 106 Cambridge Street Boston, MA  02114 Dunkin Location. I just watched the female employee with glasses and a cultural headscarf drop the mixing utensils used to make people\u2019s drinks onto the floor, pick them up and continue to use them to make people\u2019s orders without washing them. She has been coughing constantly in the food preparation area without making any effort to cover her mouth.\n\nI cancelled my wife and I\u2019s order and will not ever return to Dunkin Donuts. I am submitting a complaint with the city. Disgusting. Stay away.  Seriously.  This location has notoriously had issues with cleanliness and other safety protocols.  They actually recently got ordered to shut down due to a failed safety inspection, but they remained open for 2 more weeks, which wasn't allowed.  I know this location because there used to be a pretty good Italian restaurant connected to this location, so every time I went to the restaurant to get take out I saw this DD.  Unfortunately this DD has all kinds of issues and needs to close.  If you want a coffee, go to the DD at government center (basically across the street) or further down Cambridge at at MGH. It's permanently closed now. Never reopened after being shut down by the health department. The guy who took my order was touching everything, THEN touched the food with his BARE HANDS! I told him to wear gloves to which he proceeded still touch everything and go back to the food. Disgusting service. Train your employees better.\nHe also dropped a knife on the floor and picked it back up. Edit: from 3 to 2 stars.\n\nHave been multiple times at this location and never had a problem until today. The last times I went, there were 2-3 employees and order would be done right. Today, 4 employees and no one is paying attention to the stickers or even putting stickers on food to make sure to give the right one to the customers! Cashier lady was nice. But employee who was handling food, messed up multiple orders while I was in the store because he wouldn\u2019t put stickers on the bags, and my husband received one of those wrong orders\u2026 Just awful when you add more people but don\u2019t train them properly\u2026 And I gladly waited for my food as I was not in the rush, so not complaining about the time. Ordered delivery from this restaurant. It was delivered hot and fresh. I got the chicken and lamb combo bowl. The meats were good but the rice left much to be desired. The red hot sauce was very good, I love spicy and this hit the spot. The green sauce was tasty and the BBQ tasted standard. The delivery came with no utensils even when I added a note to please include utensils. I had to use a coffee cup lid to eat with. During my visit of the Downton Boston area I became increasingly hungry for some Mediterranean grub. As I took up a local search, Shah halal foods popped up to try.\n\nEntering the place you\u2019ll face a sort of dirty walkway to enter that can be off putting if that type of thing bothers you.\n\nInside I was greeted by 2 fellas wanting to help as they showed me the menu.\n\nThe menu wasn\u2019t that big but held enough dishes to satisfy a visit.\n\nFrom rice plates to salads to pita wraps and sides that consist of fries, wings, and prepackaged deserts.\n\nI ordered a falafel wrap and a side of fries. Unfortunately the falafel was frozen hockey pucks that were frozen that they deep fried for about 5 minutes. The pita it came on was pretty tasty but the falafel itself was pretty dry and no flavor.\n\nMy toppings were cucumber, onion, lettuce, and hot sauce with their cilantro mint, & white sauce.\n\nThe sauces combined were awesome unfortunately the way they wrap the sandwich most of the product gets on the wrap and not the sandwich which is a bummer because the little bit that made the sandwich helped the dryness of the frozen falafel.\n\nThe French fries were thick cut potatoes with some sort of a coating on it that appeared to be seasoning. However, the flavor was just not there.\n\nIt was a reasonable priced dish and not bad for food on the run. Just not a go to for authentic Mediterranean which is a great food choice. Just got lunch 9/27/23 at 12:30 . The place was jamming with buisness ! Knew it would be good . The girl working the counter was so sweet . She was super proficient and fast ! Only 2 people working and I was in and out in less than 5 mins ! Got a chicken and lamb combo plate, with of course white sauce !huge portions . I\u2019m definitely coming back. Shah's Halal has generous portion sizes, chunks of veggies (cucumber/tomatoes/onions) with chunks of lamb for thier gyros. The quality of the gyro is filled to the brim which makes it hard to stay in a wrap.\n\nTheir lamb was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the white sauce paired so well with their green chutney! The lamb gyros we ordered tasted so delicious. The pita bread was soft to chew, sauces were good and toppings were fresh. They ask you to choose your own toppings beside the meat and you can watch it being prepared. Also satisfied with the overall service we received from the employees. Used to be cafe podima, now podima pizza. Not sure if its the same owners. Quick quality slices, haven't tried anything else yet. Amazing service, went here in the late afternoon with my family after spending the day walking all around Boston, good food- paramount to NYC pizza. Amazing quality dough. Very nice owner, had a lovely conversation with him. Quick service, hot fresh food. I don't eat meat so I had the margherita pizza and Adams pizza, both were delicious and well made. My family had some kind of panini and a Hawaiian style pizza, great reactions from them, they smelled delicious as well! Will definitely be returning in the future with my college buddies, great atmosphere, not very busy in the afternoon. The food is amazing here, but the guy taking orders is not very kind. Maybe he was having a bad day, but he shouldn't curse at the delivery driver in front of customers. He also had an attitude when I asked how long my order would be, that I ordered online ahead of time, but it still wasn't ready when I arrived.... after the time my online confirmation said it would be ready. If I wasn't on my lunch break and pressed for time, I would've just walked out and ordered someplace else. Nothing but good things to say about these guys!  My son and I dropped in while visiting Boston and had a great time talking with the workers there.  They treated my son very well and encouraged him in pursuing his eventual career and education.  They are hiring so check them out if you need a job! ;)\n\nThe pizza was excellent and will come back next time we are in Boston. I do not recommend spending your money here. I purchased a meatball sub and buffalo chicken sub. After having a baby, I was craving a meatball sub for 3 days. We spend $23 for 2 supposed large subs. I took pictures, they are not large and definitely not worth the cost. My husband said his buffalo chicken sub was good but was very salty. My meatball tasted like plain ground beef and was slightly undercooked. Meatballs looked more like cat food or tuna. I was disappointed as I was dissatisfied after desiring a meatball sub. This charming Italian restaurant is a hidden gem for those seeking a cozy and intimate dining experience. From the moment we stepped in, the warm ambiance and inviting decor set the perfect tone for a delightful meal. The service was impeccable, our waiter was both attentive and friendly, making sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive.\nWe opted for the three-course meal, and every dish exceeded our expectations. The cheese fondue with steak tips and mushrooms was rich, creamy, and absolutely mouthwatering. The chicken parmigiana that followed was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and topped with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. To end on a sweet note, the tiramisu was light, flavorful, and the perfect finale to an already fantastic meal.\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a romantic date night spot or just a cozy place to enjoy outstanding Italian food, this restaurant is a must-visit. Highly recommended! We enjoyed 50/pp 3 course menu from Grotto! Great value! The food was delicious! Love the atmosphere of the restaurant! Chicken risotto and Tiramisu so good! Outstanding Italian dining in Boston. The food was great, the service was outstanding, and the ambiance is made for a cozy evening dinner. I look forward to being back! We stumbled upon this place while looking for a spot to eat in the city, and what a pleasant find! It\u2019s small but super cozy. The staff was fantastic, and the food was even better. The dessert we picked was fine, but the main course was absolutely amazing. They also have a solid selection of wines from Italy. The food here was a mix of hits and misses. I had the Beef Wellington, which was delicious, but my friend\u2019s chicken parm came with pasta that tasted stale and undercooked. Even the desserts were disappointing\u2014the tiramisu wasn\u2019t traditional at all and weirdly tasted like Cinnamon Toast Crunch.\n\nThe worst part, though, was the terrible service from the white man waiter working dinner on 1/25/25. He seemed like he didn\u2019t want to be there and was taking it out on us. His sassy attitude made the experience uncomfortable and unwelcoming. He probably didn\u2019t care because we had a party of six, meaning gratuity was automatically applied.\n\nThe food isn\u2019t good enough to make up for service this bad. I won\u2019t be coming back. I was a block away from my first trip to Florina when it hit me- the unmistakable, tantalizing, god-given scent of freshly baked pizza. After a short wait in a longish line I picked up two slices of this bad boy and even though I CAN EAT, I still ended up with leftovers. The service was quick, friendly and efficient, no complaints there. Not many places to sit so keep that in mind if you're planning on eating in. I'll be back! Hands down, Florina is my favorite pizza shop in Boston! New York-style slices, quick and efficient service, unassuming little shop feel. When you get a slice, it\u2019s got the perfect crisp, no flop, and a slight tanginess to the sauce that I absolutely love. Their caprese sub is also really good, I always add prosciutto to it and ask for balsamic added. The sub roll is always soft and the tomato la fresh, and the mozzarella is so creamy. My only knock is that they aren\u2019t open late or on weekends! Go visit and get a slice!! The pizza was delicious. The dine-in area is small and cramped.Takeout may be a better option during peak times. I stopped in here on my way to the train at the end of a long day to grab a slice with coworkers. We got slices of crispy delicious thin crust pizza ready to eat bigger than our heads for $6 a slice. This is very affordable in Boston! And the pizza was amazing! Mine had prosciutto, arugula and blue cheese. I\u2019ve never had anything like it. My friend got a friend ball of risotto and bolognese and I got a bite: it was amazing, too. We also got lunch delivered to the office in November along with salad and gluten free pizzas. They provided house made homemade Italian dressing and it was affordable and delicious. I will definitely return. Great local Sicilian pizza spot in Beacon Hill.\n\nI\u2019ve been making the occasional stop to Florina for lunch over the past two years, and let me tell you, it\u2019s a slice above the rest\u2014except maybe a few spots in the North End. During peak lunch hours, the lines can get quite long, so I usually just grab a slice or two for takeout. I\u2019m loyal to their Sicilian slices, so I can\u2019t comment on the regular ones, but the Sicilian has the perfect amount of crunch, and the bottom crust doesn\u2019t flop\u2014 just the way I like it.\n\nI also occasionally swing by for a late lunch when I\u2019m in the mood for a sandwich or pasta, and most of what I\u2019ve tried hits the spot with its straightforward goodness. One of my favorites is \"That\" sandwich, loaded with a satisfying hunk of breaded chicken, roasted red peppers, and a drizzle of white balsamic vinaigrette. The chicken cutlet itself is decent, but it\u2019s the classic combo that really makes it cluck.\n\nWhen it comes to pasta, I usually go for the Linguine Pesto\u2014it\u2019s always a winner. On the other hand, their tomato/ plum sauce-based pastas sometimes turn out a bit too watery. The sauce doesn\u2019t cling to the rigatoni, which leaves the dish a bit bland. As for the arancini, I found it to be just meh. Since it\u2019s premade and reheated, it lacks that crispy, golden crunch.\n\nIf you find yourself near Boston Common, I highly recommend carbing up with their sandwiches, pesto linguine, or a slice of Sicilian pizza."

    "reviews": "I want privacy when I shop, I don't want to ask someone to wake up from their standing nap every time I need an item from a shelf.\nI'm an independent human being who pays for the things they need.\nAbsolutely no respect or concern for someone like me. Today I witnessed awful behavior with a male manager and a female employee. They didn't know I overheard but as a mother it made me very upset and I wanted to step in . This manager was speaking to this young woman in such a derogatory tone and telling her that she'd better do this and she better do that basically making it a hostile work environment and trying to make her afraid. As a manager myself , there is a way to talk to your staff and this was one of them This man should not be working Not only in a retail environment but in a capacity where he's left to be alone and not Monitored with staff because he is not capable He's not capable of talking to people in a respectful way. I have seen him Speaking Two customers in a very snippy way with the Female employee today was absolutely disgusting.\nI have.\nBeen at the self check out and he has tried to stand behind Behind me and I have no problem speaking up for myself and I have told him excuse me, sir.You need to back up You're in my bubble Another time, I said to him, can I help you And he said no I'm just .  Making sure you don't need help.    I said if I need help.I would ask.\nHonest.\nIf there was a way for me to tell this young Parents I would. I think corporate should be aware of the way the Man is talking to his staff And acting on sales floor. If he can throw something on the sales floor got only knows what he's doing in his office Or in the break room for me.It seems like he is intimidating his staff at all levels This is a very big deal.\nVery concerned Employees here were very helpful.  We were waiting on hold with a ticket provider in a down to the wire situation, and our phone was down to 3%! It was make or break.  We explained the situation to Lena and she was able to quickly and efficiently help us get a charger.  Big smile the whole time and made sure we got everything we needed.  Really helped us out, thanks Lena! The two ladies and the security guard were wonderful. I was in a foul mood and they lifted my spirits with there witty banter and good good humor and energy. It really changed my entire evening for the better. Wow this is an awful CVS.   I am assuming they get robbed a lot because half the items are under lock and key.  Even if you want a chapstick or something like that you need someone to unlock it for you.  Then I made the \"mistake\". of going to the register to be rung up because almost every time I use the self check out something goes wrong and they have to come over anyway.   I was told by the woman at the register to use the self checkout even though she just rang up 2 other customers.   Then afterwards she accused me.of trying to take photos of her ( not! ). Maybe she thinks she is Taylor Swift. I don't know. I tell her I didn't and offer to show her my phone for proof.  She refuses bur.makesmit.clear she still thinks I did it. .I don't even care enough about her to walk my phone over, why does she think she is so important I need to be taking her picture.    Whatever... that CVS, and that \"cashier\" are not worth my time The management and staff at the Causeway branch are completely incompetent and unable to perform the basic duties of their job.\n\nI attempted to open a checking account in-person and was told it could only be done with an appointment. Great - I leave my details and expect a call to schedule an appointment. After two weeks, still no call - so I go in and talk with the same employees. I get the same story, \u201csorry we can\u2019t help you, you\u2019ll need to make an appointment with our manager\u201d. Another month goes by and I hear nothing. I\u2019m glad I learned up front how Santander treats potential customers, and I made the easy decision to open an account with Citizens.\n\nThe management at this location should be fired and the staff should be trained on basic customer service. Reporting this branch to the BBB. I\u2019m not angry, I just feel that my time has been wasted. Honestly don't even know why this branch is open.\n\nThese employees do whatever they can to NOT help their customers. I work for a local restaurant, with accounts at Santander, and the employees in this branch almost refuse to do business with us (ie, make us change) to the point where I tried to open a personal account AND WAS REFUSED.\n\nWHAT BANK REFUSES PEOPLE TO OPEN CHECKING/SAVINGS ACCOUNT?! It's literally the point of a bank.\n\nThe management here, and all the staff should be terminated. Super friendly employees. Never had a problem here.\n\nSaw a guy counting his cash, teller gave it to him after counting from the counting machine, guy counted it twice, he said each time he counted less than what he should receive. Teller used the machine again and it was the correct amount. Teller counted it with her own hands and it was the right amount. Guy never apologized and sounded like he was making a huge issue. Teller took it professionally and told him to have a good day. Annoyed in general with Santander, their hours are too limited (9a-4p, M-F), their policies are frustrating, the mobile deposit check limit is too low, etc etc. The one star review is not for this branch/the people who work here, more the company. I have not been in person, but went by the ATM just now, which is supposedly open until 10p, but the door does not unlock. My card works. Frustrating. I work during the entirety of their open hours and so will be planning to close my account with them shortly. Card cloning device on one of the ATMs. Be careful. I passed by this 7-11 by chance, and its unique \u201cgreen\u201d just got my attention. A standard chain of corner shop. There is a decent selection of food and drinks to choose from here and its central location makes it convenient. Unfortunately when I went they were accepting cash only which was annoying. The other day, I bought a banana. It said $0.79 for a banana, two for $1. At the register, the cashier charged me $1 for one. When I said that it was the wrong price, she gave me a smirk and didn't correct it.   Should report it to the attorney's general. Usually great experiences here but watch when you pay with cash, the clerk shorted me my change and when I questioned her, she gave me the correct amount... DON\u2019T GET PASSPORT PHOTO here go to CVS next door. For the love of god the guy made my head too small and then too large on different attempts. Super slow. Don\u2019t do it. Only go here for convenience store stuff. Came up from VT with my girlfriend for a pouya concert and decided to stop in, the people were incredibly friendly and helpful I highly suggest stopping by if you\u2019re traveling! Negative reviews do not reflect how these guys are currently operating! Great job ascend! Whenever I have a problem that\u2019s easily solved the managers give stupid excuses as to why they can\u2019t help. I just left the store, hoping to exchange store credits for a defective battery. The manager said there is nothing she can do because it \u201cseems like I bought it over a month ago\u201d. Even though it\u2019s brand new without a scratch, and it\u2019s not working. This is the fourth time I\u2019ve gotten cheap, easily broken accessories from there and I will no longer be recommending this place to anyone. I\u2019ve been a member since they first opened and it\u2019s only been going down hill since. Anothy and the other woman manager need to be fired. First their workers go on strike for wage theft and now this\u2026 When I was there tonight my clerk Kev just couldnt get my order right.  Multiple attempts to get it right.  I finally said forget it and went back over to place another order.  Went up the second time and the other clerk had trouble as well.  Not only that he tried to steal from me.  He crumpled up the receipt instead of giving it to me.  They tried to gaslight me and say he had given me the receipt but it was still wrinkled up on the counter so I said \"that is probably it and I be you owe me change\"  Sure enough I was due 6.00 and he thought I was a stupid chick.  I tried to complain to the manager in charge, I was quite upset, and he didnt seem to care enough to listen to me so I didnt even get to tell them about the thief they have working for them.  I was quickly dismissed, given a 10- credit.  But then I missed my train because of the delays.  Took over 25 minutes to get my order right, attempted thievery from the staff and then a 3.5 hour delay on my train ride home.  There was no way I was not leaving a review. Why does the \u201cpick your own oz\u201d deal not qualify for free delivery?\nY\u2019all made the subtotal $99 but a $100 subtotal is required to qualify for free delivery. Since it\u2019s 28 grams you can\u2019t add anything to the cart to get the extra $1 to qualify\u2026.\nStupid policy, just make the deal $100 instead of $99 so we can get free delivery\u2026\u2026..\nSo so stupid and terrible business marketing execution you\u2019re losing money on the deliveries you could be doing with this deal\u2026 This place is unprofessional!  Their Manager Aria or Ariel needs customer service training and has a very horrible attitude!  The prices change on you in a matter of minutes and the managers do nothing to assist with THEIR mistake. The burden should never be on the customer when it's the establishment's prices that changed suddenly!  You should never make price changes to a product throughtout the work day.  They should be made when the store is closed and not in operation.\nI sent a complaint to corporate and never heard back from them either! Amazing nail salon. I\u2019ve been to most- if not all in the area and Navy is the best. She is kind and the salon is beyond clean. Something everyone needs to consider !!! Highly would recommend This was my first time coming and I came because I had waited over 30 minutes at Diamond Nail with an appointment and decided to leave. I got here a had great conversation and felt very welcome. Not only will I be a regular from here on out but I also feel like I found a home away from home. I feel bad because the girl who did my nails was super nice. However, they told me they had time to take me and they did not. I ended up spending almost 3.5 hours there and it was not relaxing at all. By the end of it I was super frustrated but kept it to myself. My acrylic fill looks really really bad but I just wanted to get it done and over with so I didn\u2019t complain. Paid over $100 after tip for that and a basic pedi with regular polish. I will never go back. Went there to get the heart designs on my nails fixed from another nail salon. They were absolutely amazing all so sweet and I left there happy with my nails fixed to the way I originally wanted them.  This place is awesome thank you all so much \u2764\ufe0f I had a 5pm appointment this evening. The nail tech who took me was very nice however she was very sloppy with her work. My nails look rushed and unfinished. Not to mention overly priced for such sloppy work. The nail tech then tells me she doesn\u2019t know how to do nail designs. Just for a basic acrylic fill and regular polish they charged me $63.80. Most places charge $35-$50 for a fill. Not this place! Save your money and go elsewhere!!!! Will not be returning back\u2026 Marvin is great and knows how to pick out the right bottle of wine for any occasion. This is one of my favorite liquor stores because it's classy and convenient. Very knowledgeable new ownership - highly recommended. Hours listed are not correct. Went at 8:45 Pm Saturday night and it was closed Owner is very knowledgeable with wine selection. Great selection and helpful staff Alpha Graphics is amazing to work with! They take the most careful attention to detail. We had our wedding Save the Dates printed with them and they advised me on paper, envelopes, and more details I wouldn't have even thought of! They turned out better than I could imagine. Mackenzie is the best! We will definitely be returning for the rest of our wedding printing needs. David at AlphaGraphics was fantastic to work with! He provided a prompt, comprehensive, very reasonable quote, a proof that was exactly what we were looking for (and we didn't even know it!), and it was installed quickly and professionally. He was also quite friendly and patient. I look forward to doing future business with AlphaGraphics! This was my first time working with AlphaGraphics and they exceeded expectations. It was easy to get a quote. The quote arrived quickly and was easy to understand. Once we were ready to move forward with the project, they were prompt in sending proofs, and beat all their own timelines. I would definitely work with them again. Alphagraphics is always there for us when we have project with one of our clients, from simple things to elaborate and large scale images for backdrops, they always are so helpful and do an amazing job. We are a UK based training company and needed materials printed to a client site in Boston & New York. Alpha Graphics were competitively priced, responsive and delivered exactly what we needed within the timeframe. I'd highly recommend! Well....that was fun! My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to have some Irish coffee, it was so cold! We found this place just walking by and what a great discovery. We didn't know when we walked in but apparently the place is quite famous to watch games and have some drinks with friends. They have merchant from players covering the walls. It was slow when we came in but just one hour later the place was packed! The servers were nice and welcoming, despite it is primarily a very straight dude crowd \ud83d\ude00. They were super respectful and we appreciate it. We will be back once we return to Boston (pics taken with Pixel 3 xl) Overall a terrible experience where I went during the Stanley Cup Finals, and it was a madhouse there. I get that they were super busy, but that's no excuse for our waiter to not check in with us to see how the things were going. Maybe because we were a party of two, the waiter didn't care for a small group. Our drinks were empty, and when we asked him for more drinks, he said that he'd grab it for us and of course, that never happened. The only thing the waiter got correct was the order other than that our waiter was awful. The food was excellent; it's just too bad that a terrible waiter ruined the overall experience there. I'm willing to give them one more chance, let's hope my next time there I'll have a better experience. The shrimp and scallops Diane was amazing but the drinks were watered down and lame. If you come here I would enjoy the food and beer. Stay away from the cocktails. Also, the place was super dead on a Saturday night. If you are looking for a chill laid back sports bar then this is your place. Located right outside the Garden on Canal St, The Fours is a franchised local Boston sports bar. They have a nice apps menu, there were several things I could have eaten if I were coming here for a meal. There is a dining area in addition to the bar. Priced a little higher than most, but still a bargain when compared to the prices inside of the Garden. There is a lot of competition in in this area. One could bar hop around a single block and be just about ready for the T ride home. The fours triple play was delicious, especially the philly cheesesteak egg rolls.  The Boston memorabilia was also impressive -- an extensive collection covering everything from the Boston marathon to Boston sports teams.\n\nThe only reason why we didn't give it a five was because of the atmosphere/crowd was less than what we were hoping for for an iconic sports restaurant/bar. Service was good. Ordered $30 steak tips. Came out with 5 silver dollar size tips. It looked like I ordered a kids plate. It felt like a joke. I got a slice of pizza to fill up before I went to the game. When we got there we were sat right away. We had a party of two and there was another party of two that got there right before us. We were sat right by each other. Our waiter came over, took our drink order and it came out quickly. After he brought the drinks he left and didn\u2019t take our food order for another 15 minutes. He walked by our table multiple times and saw we still had the menus so clearly we hadn\u2019t ordered yet. A different couple that arrived after us got their food order taken by him before we did. The party of two that arrived right before us got their food before we even ordered. By the time we got our food, that party had paid and left already. I thought it was way too long of a wait to order. The waiter probably forgot about us but again he walked by multiple times. While we were eating he never stopped by to ask how the food was. We got the chicken tacos and a burger. The food was good overall, but my plate seemed to have a wet napkin under the taco holder which I thought was strange. The restaurant was okay. I\u2019m not sure if I will go again. Loved the food! Highly recommend the chicken tacos!\nWe overall had a great experience. However, when my transaction came through on my statement, the charge was higher than what was reflected on my bill. Huricane's is a great pub located walking distance to the Garden/North Station. We were going to a concert at the Garden and wanted to grab supper before we got inside. Huricane's had a full house and was still able to sit all of us, a party of 7 in less than 20 minutes. The menu is limited but has a little something for everyone. It is actually kinda brilliant to minimize the time people are staring through pages and holding up the ordering process. We had drinks in hand minutes after seating. I had a few of their rum punch drinks that went down easy and helped to relax me for the unknown night ahead. The food came out promptly. I had a fried chicken sandwich with their Mumbo sauce. This was a sauce with a little sweetness balanced by some heat. It was really good. If I had to complain the bacon could have been cooked a little more, however the sandwich was great! Fries were cooked perfect with a nice crunch and soft interior. Others at the table got a caprese sandwich, tacos, mac n cheese, chicken sandwiches. I heard no complaints and saw a lot of cleaned plates. We had 3 kids with us. Atmosphere was family friendly. The pub was very clean and our server was great. Definitely would recommend! Here for the eagles commanders game, amazing service. Felix might be the best gameday waiter I\u2019ve ever had. He was everywhere at once, handling so many people and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gotten my drinks so quickly over and over. He\u2019s really really good. Fast service before the Celtics game! We didn't order any food but the menu did look good. It was empty when we walked in but filled up quick because of the game and service still didn't lack. Seemed like there were cooler bars around we would of rather tried but this place was still really nice and typical of a sports bar The food was pretty good, the menu was small, the atmosphere was okay (really loud music), our waitress wasn\u2019t great (didn\u2019t come for water refill, wasn\u2019t very friendly, seemed annoyed that we didn\u2019t order alcohol like the rest of our table, tried to rush us while ordering). Cobb Salad was yummy. Great place with wicked good beer prices. Waitress Sarah G was great. I like going here before basketball at the garden. They have the beer selection I want and are rarely overcrowded. I have been here a few times and really enjoy the staff. They were friendly and held conversations with the patrons. The bartender was excellent at his job, creating new cocktails and drinks he was unfamiliar with. The food is standard, but was done very well. Service started off rocky. The girl who seated us had a horrible attitude. When we asked to be seated elsewhere so we can see the game, she replied with \"do what you want.\"\nRegardless of that, it was a good experience. Our server was friendly and attentive. The food was great. Would recommend and would go back. Event ended around 10 pm at TD Garden which is pretty late here and all popular spots closed their kitchens already so rather than search and travel to a good restaurant, I figure I\u2019ll do a slice or two here and was pleasantly surprised since I\u2019m from NYC.  However, when I get two additional slices, they were not as good and somewhat dry.  I guess food in general tastes better when you\u2019re starving or just Law of Diminishing Returns.  The last two slices are probably better marks and they are not only dry but contains somewhat bitter tomato sauce and cheese not as plentiful as first two slices.  Though, I\u2019ll admit line moves fast and appreciate convenience of being across the street from TD and opening till 11 pm. Amazing pizza and service. Did a quick through Boston and decided to stop and try was not disappointed.  Definitely coming back next trip.  Highly recommend \ud83d\udc4c Halftime Pizza was a blast! We came in from out of town (South Carolina) and it was everything we could hope for. Luigi and Justino showed they really care for their customer by providing a friendly and exciting environment to grab a bite especially after a game at TD Garden. 10/10 would recommend! The pepperoni slices I got were incredibly greasy and were easily some of the worst slices of pizza I've ever had. They actually upset my stomach really bad and made me a bit sick.\n\nService was pretty lackluster. Apparently having a couple of slices heated up from their takeout was a no-go. I won't be spending $12 on two slices of pizza from here ever again. Always a good atmosphere and food every time I swing by. The guys that work there are great and have amazing customer service!\ud83d\ude42 Today I tried the sweet chili wings and they were delicious! I always leave with a full belly and happy soul!\u270c\ud83c\udffd Thank you guys.\nUpdate 2/24/25\nI came in today for a slice of pizza and some wings and am glad I did! I tried a new flavor wings, and yet still very nice. \ud83d\ude0bI like the atmosphere here, the guys that work there are always welcoming and good with some suggestions.\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf55 Thanks again guys! For the price point it is one of the most satisfying \ud83d\ude0c meals you can have. This location they were really generous. Huge portion delicious.  I signed up for point and got a huge portion of spicy queso and chips. So good!! This is a franchise but individually owned, which tends to make them hit or miss. This location is a hit! Top notch service with well-made delicious food. The servers are always very kind and friendly to me. I've never gotten a bad burrito here. From lovely smiles to the most kind and polite gestures; This place always makes me feel welcomed. It\u2019s rare today, you go into any To-Go establishment and receive such kindness (which really stuck out to me!). Running late for a train or just grabbing brunch; They are always ready and polite, which is why I continue to come back to them. Keep up the great service everyone! We stumbled on this Qdoba after attempting to eat in one of the eateries @ North Station on a Bruins Game day.  We expected to experience the same atmosphere - searching for a table under blaring music...  A nice surprise awaited us, a group of vegans with two young kids.  The place wasn't busy at all (sometimes, it's a bad sign, but not this time & place).  We found good choices to satisfy us.  The bathroom was clean.  We'll definitely eat here again when we visit that area. Best Qdoba I've had, they filled my bowl really well, AMAZING ENERGY from the staff (they were fun my entire time I was eating) and so so fresh food. Incredibly good bowl, I've only been to this location once but probably the best veggie bowl I've had in a long time.. I ordered a hot chocolate and my cup was not filled all the way. It tastes like Dunkin' hot chocolate.\nService was friendly. The place was in decent shape.\nWhen I did a Google search for \"hot chocolate near me\", Dunkin' wasn't mentioned. I was glad they were here and open! I was there 17dec by 3:30pm. The shop was very dirty and the person was not welcoming and not wanting to work\u2026 I asked to see what looks like a small or medium cup as it is my first time here, he didn\u2019t want to show and the donuts a got were just thrown in the bag and all got messed up.\nI heard about history of Dunkin\u2019s in Boston.. too bad I think I fell in the worst\u2026 I want there this morning I got a Bagle with cream cheese and they made my Bagle  Burnt and  the Bagle is so hard like a rock. Unacceptable they should get Retrianed how to make people sandwiches & the employe looks like they don't even like this job. They are very slow. Unacceptable went to this dunkin after a concert to get food. my mom doesn\u2019t speak the best english so I was ordering for her and everything she wanted was out, which was fine, until the worker looks at me and goes we have a line and made me feel extremely rushed and stupid. It's not my fault you\u2019re out of everything. Horrible service did not feel welcome at all. Lots of donut options at this Dunkin\u2019 compared to the one near hit. Our hot caramel craze latte became cold too fast and was way too sugary at the end - not sure if they mixed it properly. Fresh warm bread with a tomato spread, delicious. The food was great! Best stuffed grape leaves I've ever had! The Istanbul salad was amazing, and I don't even like tomatoes. The meat dishes were perfectly tender and flavorful, loved the yogurt side too. Thanks for a wonderful lunch! Place is at very convenient location. Their food is good, the portions are adequate but pricey. Great place to try Turkish food, they even make their own Ayran which is frothy and delicious. Very solid Turkish spot. I had the lamb doner kebab wrap which was a good portion for the price. The free bread they give is piping hot and fresh as well. Would come back again to try different dishes. Turkish food, meat is good quality but still not same as home of course. It is not expensive and if you wanna try something different then regular fast food come here.\nService was amazing, Turkish guys are nice, my kankas !\nVery good experience \ud83d\ude01 Place is at very convenient location. Very close to the TD garden. Food is good but pricey. Service was excellent as owner let me use restroom after watching the celtics game and I didn't even had to buy anything from the place. Rude cashier!! Felt rushed when I was getting my order and his snarky comments were not necessary. People that can\u2019t be awake at the crack of dawn to help people should not work in customer service. Came by at 517pm on a friday and the worker had already closed the kitchen; her answer to walk in the rain 2blocks to the next dunkin. So only come after 5 if u only want drinks i guess. Starbucks is across the street and the kitchen is still open two hours before close Good spot food and coffee was good. Can\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t put some stools in there so folks could sit down. Average Dunkin Donuts. The breakfast sandwich, egg and cheese croissant, was okay.  No wait so it did come quickly.  Service was basic and met one's needs.  The location is convenient to the TD Garden area. Employees seemed very overwhelmed with the volume of orders, but overall not problematic For fans of the iconic 1980s sitcom Cheers, visiting the pub that inspired the show is like stepping into TV history. Cheers on Beacon Hill (formerly the Bull & Finch Pub) captures the nostalgia and charm of the original series while offering a welcoming and authentic Boston bar experience.\n\nThe moment you walk in, you\u2019re greeted with the feeling that this truly is \u201cwhere everybody knows your name.\u201d While the entrance might be unassuming, don\u2019t let that fool you\u2014the warmth and character are undeniable. The real treat is upstairs, where the original television set has been meticulously preserved. It's a dream for any fan to see the replica bar and picture Sam, Diane, Norm, and the gang in their element.\n\nThe food? Classic, satisfying bar fare that complements the cozy, convivial atmosphere. Whether you\u2019re indulging in a burger or sipping a pint, it\u2019s the kind of place that makes you want to linger a little longer.\n\nCheers on Beacon Hill retains the charm that earned it the title of Boston Magazine\u2019s \u201cBest Neighborhood Bar\u201d in 1982. While the neighborhood has grown to include fans from around the world, the pub\u2019s heart and soul remain firmly intact. Whether you\u2019re here for the nostalgia, the history, or just a great time, Cheers is a must-visit spot in Boston.\n\nSo grab a stool, raise a glass, and toast to the pub that inspired a cultural phenomenon. Cheers! What a great place to visit while walking the Boston Common. You walk downstairs and it looks just like the actual set from the show but.... the actual set is located upstairs in another part of the bar that you can sit in. The lights, sober pictures and bar are right from the show and you can enjoy them. They serve food here as well as many drinks You don\u2019t know what to expect when you come to a place like this because you love the sitcom and know it wasn\u2019t filmed here but the exterior was used! Definitely a niche location and situation. It did not disappoint at all! It was so iconic coming up to the door and walking down the stairs! I didn\u2019t care who thought what, I came in and called out to Norm and Cliff! \ud83d\ude02it was packed and they still got us seated! Was so neat to be here and enjoy the experience! We got sat and had great service and the food was incredible, you\u2019d expect something substandard however it exceeded expectations! You can buy your beer mug to take home and they wrap it nicely and they offer many drink choices! Was a very good meal and experience all around. The decorations are cool too! After you eat toy can go upstairs and see the replica bar and go to the gift shop! The gift shop has a lot of neat stuff some is a little over priced especially shirts for low quality materials or I would have bought more before leaving but doesn\u2019t change my rating. Was so satisfying to be here and experience this! Great setting and location too! We didn't even plan on stopping in.  We walked across the park and across the street,  I saw Cheer's! OMG!!! 10/10 !\nWe were cold and ready for luck and what a welcome this gem is! How very nostalgic and so cool.  The food,  service and atmosphere was everything you could want.  Awesome gift shop up stairs! We loved it.  It was so cool! Big fan of the TV show growing up! I just had to stop in when visiting Boston. What a neat experience! Food and service were great. You can pay the extra fee and take a souvenir glass home with you too. Before you leave, don't forget to go upstairs to see the real bar used in the recording of the show. 10/10 Recommend. The 1st two photo is what A & B gave me for my order of Sheppard Pie. The last photo is what is on the menu. I paid almost $17 for 1/3 of a cup of ground beef and 4 tablespoons of mash potatoes. If I would have ordered this in house instead of take out\u2026 it would have gone back. The mash is box mash, no seasoning and it tastes like grease. False advertising. I should have gone to McDonalds. Terrible. If u order take out. Check it before u leave ! I rarely write reviews, but I\u2019m still astonished at the level of dishonesty. I ordered a margherita pizza, which comes with basil, but it arrived with lettuce. When I pointed it out, the waitress (who was also surprised) took it back to the kitchen. She returned to explain that the kitchen had run out of basil and intentionally substituted lettuce without telling me. They didn\u2019t even ask if I wanted something different\u2014they just assumed I wouldn\u2019t notice and tried to pass lettuce off as basil by cutting it the same way. This has never happened to me before, and it\u2019s completely unacceptable. The pizza itself (after I removed the lettuce myself) was tasteless and disappointing but what really ruined my night was the deception. At least the waitress was apologetic and didn\u2019t charge me for the pizza, but this place tried to fool me and I\u2019ll never go back. Great place. Burger was perfect. Potato skins were good. Waitress was excellent. Star of the night was the blonde hostess. She went above and beyond to slide us in after a pizza place close by cancelled our reservation. Great people work here and that makes this place a winner! I\u2019ve been here a few times.\n\nI remember the first time (last year, 2024, when I deleted my old review), I was treated very, very differently by a bartender. I left a pretty mean review back then, and the owner/manager replied to me. I didn\u2019t want to get too much attention, so I deleted my review.\n\nAfter a while, I decided to give this place another try.\n\nI\u2019ve been here a few times this year. Honestly, it\u2019s good for the price: $3 Coors Light, $11.95 lunch specials, half-priced appetizers, and the $5 burger deal.\n\nI have to say, this is a very, very good place if you\u2019re hanging out in the North Station area.\n\nA reminder for everyone: the pizza is Detroit-style, very thick and heavy. Stopped in for dinner before a Bruins game. The food was delicious, the service was top tier, and the atmosphere was comfortable. I had the maple bacon burger with sweet potato fries. It was cooked to perfection and so delish! Our server, Brenna, was excellent! We had a party of 7 and she was on top of everything without being overbearing and had a great demeanor and sense of humor. We\u2019ll definitely be back! Amazing cold brew coffee gallons and coffee available for local delivery. NOT A CAFE. Order online and get delivered locally. My boyfriend and I stopped here to get breakfast and were happy with the options and prices they had. There was fruit, bagels, pastries, and then breakfast sandwiches available as well as a lot of coffee. The staff was extremely friendly and fast with orders as well. There wasn't any parking, but street spots were available that I saw. Highly recommended. My company used Boston Common Coffee Co. years ago and I loved their coffee so much I continued ordering it after I left the previous org :) I am obsessed with their flavored beans and drink the Winter Wonderland year round. I will die if they stop making it! Can\u2019t wait for Pumpkin Spice to come back. And the company is just awesome too. I eat here all the time and love it, however I would not ever write a review until what happened today. My order was messed up and I had to ask after waiting some time. The staff treated this so kindly and made it seem like a big deal, I'm as easy going as they come so I was less than upset to begin with. They got me a free coffee and actually thanked me for being so kind about the whole ordeal. It was a great experience on a Sunday morning and I'll keep going back. I\u2019ve been a customer of Boston Common Coffee for many years and make regular orders of coffee. I particularly love the cold brew blend (my favorite!) and the flavored coffees. The order always arrives quickly and has everything in place. Kevin and David are also very responsive to customers. I love the coffee and am thrilled to be a customer! This place will definitely become a staple for us when we are in the area.\nWe stopped in before a concert to grab a quick bite and were met with a friendly guy behind the counter happy to help us. Grabbed a couple slices that were a little on the thin and floppy side but had great flavor. Storefront is small with limited seating but again, it was perfect for a quick 10 minute hot snack before a concert.\nStrongly recommend and we look forward to going back in the future. Just plain good pizza. Guys up front have the patented accent which was a great addition to the experience lol.\nMy only complaint, if I were to, is there's not too much room to dine in \u2014 four tables inside is all you get, but I understand the spacing isn't very generous and I also never visit the city so I'm not rly qualified to talk about that but besides that, would recommend Ate here 3 x on my trip to Boston. Good slice. Really big and fresh garden salad. The Cesar was good but had too much dressing on it for my taste, so maybe order it on the side. Prices are reasonable and proprietor is friendly. Chill atmosphere. We came from Texas to go to Fenway, and while exploring the city, we came across here.  The pizza was so good we came back the next day. Everyone was very friendly, and if we make it back to Boston, we'll definitely come back. Thanks for the great food and company! This place is great! There was just one guy in the back making the pizza and he was absolutely crushing it. The pizza came out of the oven straight to the table and tasted amazing. Will definitely be back. Definitely a good place to grab a bite before a game since it\u2019s near TD garden. I don\u2019t know what these other reviewers are talking about. I got their general breakfast plate, which included four limp strips of bacon, eggs (which were good), two \u201chash brown\u201d things which felt like straight from McDonalds, and four pieces of pre-buttered white toast (was not given an option for bread). I would not say it was bad, but I would call the food aggressively mediocre.\n\nI feel like you can get the same or much much better at almost any breakfast place around town. Perhaps I would have had a better experience with the breakfast sandwiches which were extremely reasonably priced. But for my meal, I was thoroughly underwhelmed, especially considering how many good reviews this restaurant had gotten. really enjoyed this spot! the food and service are really great! i recommend for a quick meal Excellent breakfast sandwich! And I would absolutely try anything on their menu! It\u2019s clear the owners truly care about their restaurant, clear menu items, fresh salads, etc.\nyes, we will come back here! Really clean and fresh cafe. Efficient service and good breakfast and Coffee Love the salad bar here. Everything looks and tastes fresh and the iced coffee is good too. I\u2019ll definitely be back to try their breakfast and soup offerings! What a Brew-tiful Experience! If you\u2019re in need of a morning caffeine fix that can kickstart your day better than an alarm clock, CuppaCoffee is your go-to spot! I visited on a Saturday morning, and while there was a bit of a line, it moved quickly. Within 10 minutes of ordering, we were sipping on deliciously brewed coffee that was well worth the wait.\n\nThe staff is super friendly, and they handle the rush with ease. While indoor seating is cozy but limited, there are some outdoor tables to enjoy your coffee. Bonus points: they accept credit cards, so no scrambling for cash. This was a great little shop, conveniently located just down the street from Pennyweight hotel. The Americano was flavorful and delicious. The pastry was warm and fresh. I'd certainly stop by here again while in Boston. I absolutely adore this charming coffee shop! It's a place you won't want to miss! Coffee was amazing and staff is great. Very nice place \ud83d\udc4c Excellent drip coffee. Really enjoyed the bacon egg cheese Aussie pie. Almost didn\u2019t need lunch because it was so filling. Second day I had a mixed berry scone which was also good. Staff was friendly, seemed like they knew a lot of the customers. What a Brew-tiful Experience!

    "reviews": "I switched from Mass. Eye and Ear to OCB several years ago and have never regretted it.  The staff at OCB are courteous, and they take their time, never making me feel like I'm just a cog in a machine.  My doctor, Claudia Richter, is kind, compassionate, and exercises great care in the treatment of my eye issue.  I will never leave them!!! I just went to the Wareham office as it is conveniently near work and home. They were done with me in the space of a half hour which was to see the assistant and then the Doctor.   Between the specialist and the doctor I had to go back and sit in the waiting room. I have had better exams at Visionworks.  I was there for dry eyes that I have had for months now.  Dr. recommended the same drops I have been using; only a different type of solution one and to use warm compresses. She said if this did not work I would have to see their DRY EYE SPECIALIST elsewhere and that they could not address my cataracts at this office.  I already knew I had them; but she said nothing !They are a puppy mill for patients. In and out in no time.  In a hurry and just needed to get to the next victim.  I did not much appreciate paying $60 for half an hour either. DO NOT GO HERE just because they say they are specialists from Boston.\nI would give them a minus -star if I could. I have been a client for over 20 years and have had Lasik and Cataract surgeries that have worked out extremely well\u2014-as well as excellent and dependable regular care/ckeck ups with Dr. Stephen Taylor over the entire time. First time there. Everyone was polite, nice, helpful and very knowledgeable in their specific areas of expertise. Dr. Witkin and his staff were informative and patiently took the time to explain my specific situation. Made me very comfortable that I was in good hands. Dr. Ansari is seriously the best.\ud83e\udd47 His assistant even booked my Mother\u2019s appointments in Waltham for days I have to work. She is definitely a smart women!!! Thank you for being so kind and knowledgeable. I wish you a hundred years of success to this team!! You are literally the best. Do not forget that. Highly recommended and beyond grateful! From Marina\u2019s daughter, Michelle Steph is hands down the best of the best!! I was in need of finding a new hair stylist and she came to my rescue right away. Since I\u2019ve been going to Steph, I\u2019ve never received as many compliments on my hair as I do now! She takes the time to listen to your requests, but also makes suggestions based on her experience and her insane knowledge of color. I am so happy fate brought me to LAMS and I highly suggest!! What a beautiful salon! I have know the owner, Patty Martin, for almost 20 years. I have followed her from her starting roots to where she is now. The staff here is amazingly skilled and well trained. Patty has curated a gorgeous eco-friendly environment and generated an overall client experience of perfection. From luxurious products, free drinks and snacks, to an all-inclusive pricing structure (no tips!) Whether you are looking for a traditional or edgy cut, there is a stylist here for you. Patty herself is a Davines International Colour Genius and works her magic to covert your locks from average to sensational. She is highly skilled at color correction and has an incredible eye for color placement. You will not be disappointed with the costumer service, ambiance, or the outcome of your cut or color. Parking is easy and nearby at the Necco garage. Thank you LAMS for such a great experience! If you are looking for a new stylist, I highly recommend seeing Chaude!\n\nChaude is amazing!  I have been seeing her since 2011 and won't let anyone else touch my hair.  She is extremely talented, kind, fun and a great conversationalist.  Chaude loves what she does and continues to take educational classes to expand her knowledge and skill set - so she is always fresh, on trend and growing as a professional!\n\nI had the opportunity to visit her at LAMS Boston and I am excited about coming back to this location on Summer St.\n\nThe vibe is fun, light airy and open.  The people are warm and welcoming.  You have your choice of tea and other refreshments while you wait.\n\nThe owner has thought of every small detail, including having actual hand towels in the bathroom for each guests instead of paper towels. \ud83d\udc9c Chaude is amazing!! She\u2019s new to Lams but not to me and I will follow her to the end of the world if I have to. She is an amazing colorist, my hair has never looked better or healthier. Lams is lucky to have such amazing talent as part of their team. The salon was beautiful, my experience here with her was top notch. I hope she stays here forever because I\u2019m already looking forward to being pampered there again. I cannot recommend Lams Hair Salon highly enough! From the moment I walked in, I felt genuinely welcomed and cared for. The team is incredibly professional, attentive, and talented, ensuring every detail is perfect. They truly listen to your needs and go above and beyond to deliver results that exceed expectations. The atmosphere is relaxing and friendly, making every visit an enjoyable experience. My hair has never looked or felt better\u2014thank you, Lams, for your exceptional service and dedication to your craft! You\u2019ve earned a loyal customer for life. mary show was everything When I say this was the best day of my life. Words can't express how wonderful this concert was. The queen did her thing, and Boston showed up and out. Her vocals were on point, and she sang all the classics. This show was truly one for her fans. The best moment for me is when The Queen handed me the golden mic for I'm Going Down. I couldn't believe she was in front of me and swaying and smiling. This moment was the moment of my life. At the end, The Queen says she really meant that and asked the crowd to give me another round of applause. This is an experience that could never be topped. If you get a chance to see the Queen, make sure you get as close as possible for the best pics and footage. Shoot you may even get picked to sing with the Queen. I thank Mary for giving me this moment as I never feel lucky, but on this day, I was the luckiest girl in the room. Days later, I am still on my Mary cloud. I bow down to the Queen No One better! This is not my first Mary show but definitely my best!!\n\nMy only issue is there wasnt many food venus open but otherwise cool. At the Garden to see Kylie Minogue...amazing show. Last year I came to see Madonna. Yes, amazing! This venue is well staffed, smoothly run, large enough to get the shows with a lot of technical elements but easy to navigate. Easy in and out. Usually will stay a night at a nearby hotel, since we live in Western Mass. (1st photo/video is Kylie, last 3 are from Madonna) Big shoutout to the Club level staff, it was the first time we stayed in Club and the staff there do an extraordinary job making the experience feel elevated and personal. And an EXTRA-special shoutout to Julie, the amazing Club Premium bartender/manager who was so incredibly nice - she remembered my brother and me after our first drink and greeted us so warmly all week, asking how we were enjoying things. She helped make the experience memorable.\n\nMore broadly: this is one of the most comfortable, convenient, and clean arenas in the country, and well located to boot. Spent almost a week here for the World Figure Skating Championships and it was a pleasure (and we were there 10+ hours a day!) My family has bruins season tickets. We come to the garden often, for both bruins and Celtics games as well as concerts. The new security system is amazing cuts down the wait time for getting inside tremendously. While I don\u2019t love the new bag policy - I understand it and they do have exceptions if you need to carry medical items or a diaper bag, you just need to go thru the regular bag line and have you entire bag scanned. It\u2019s convenient to be able to bring a small 6x4 purse and not have to go through that bag line, just walk through the security checkpoint and you\u2019re good to go!!\n\nSomething that cannot be bought or sold is the AMAZING atmosphere at the garden. The fans are the best, I see nothing but great sportsmanship as someone who attends many many games here. Far and few in between are the a-holes who are poor sports. Often I see bruins fans talking with, joking with, and being friendly to opposing teams fans. It\u2019s always wonderful to see.\n\nThank you for many, many years of amazing memories TD Garden - here\u2019s to a lifetime of many more to come!!! \u2618\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3b Going to a Celtics game at TD Garden is such a joy! We had an awesome time. The energy was magnetic in the arena. There are no bad seats. There are great food options there too. The game was great. Getting in and out was so easy. I did self check out.\nThere\u2019s a  guy (wearing glasses )  walking around,  talking to himself, , acting weird. probably got hight. standing behind customers  quietly and creepily. counting their  items, making sure they are  matching with the screen. So creepy. Absolutely the worst.  Rude store personnel.  The clipped coupons don't register.  Safeway needs to improve their website.\n\nWould anyone else be interested in a lawsuit against them for false advertisement.  The digital coupons don't work when I get to the register. Random - They have better jackfruit then the 6 Asian grocery stores I\u2019ve been to in Boston. And it\u2019s somehow cheaper here too.\n\nLove this grocery store. It\u2019s great for North Station Commuters and those living near the area. (I\u2019ll add more photos as I shop here more)\n\nIf this review is of some use, please hit the \u201clike\u201d button as it helps us local guides.\n\nHere are the reasons this place is a 5 star:\n\n1. Star Bucks + Mini Grocery Store for people in a hurry on the top floor. Bottom floor is the entire grocery store.\n2. They have a great selection of produce from standard to exotic. And its all fresh and vibrant\n3. The have a great selection of meat\n4. The have everything from cost effective to the primo-organic options\n5. Their cafeteria section is something I really love:\n\u2013 Hot Food options\n\u2013 Grill area\n\u2013 10 types of Wings (never seen that anywhere)\n6. You can make your own Frozen Food, and they have a TON of options\n7. They have a wide selection of alcohol from Standard to Ultra Premium (think $700 bottles)\n8. Worth re-iterating they have a lot of Organic options\n9. They have Self-Checkout and Traditional Cashiers. There's never a line, at least the times I've gone.\n10. The store is well organized\n11. It is very clean here\n12. The staff is good, friendly, and very helpful. Being from out of town (L.A.), the thought of a grocery store underground blew my mind. I was in the area to ride the train to NH. I passed by the store and didn't even know what kind of store it was.. My family and I ended up getting snacks at CVS. Now on the way back from NH, thats when I noticed there was escalators going down.\nWe went down and what a surprise. Instantly regretted going to CVS the 1st time. This market has an amazing selection of Hot Foods!! Fully stocked! I highly recommend & will definitely be a returning happy customer the next time I'm in Boston. Literally a hidden \ud83d\udc8e gem!\nThe Staff was great too, super friendly. First of all, customer service opens at 9 AM. What the hell kind of store has a customer service opening that late.\n\nSecondly, the complementary sanitizing wipes have been out for five weeks. These carts are gross. Do your job and get it done right!\n\n...prices are expensive already at this location! Lovely staff this Sunday afternoon. The pizza was beautiful and I appreciate the care and detail the employees put into making my families pizza and sandwich. The staff were professional and I believe mainly new, to me at least, but obviously experienced and helpful. Thank you Domino's Staniford Street for this Sunday's blessed meal. My 7 year old and I were very satisfied and appreciated your time, effort and care! \u263a\ufe0f I was having a rough and thought \"You know it's been a while since I've had dominoes. I'm gonna get some for myself.\" When I got there they were evidently VERY busy. A lady said \"Sorry! I'll be right there. Busy at the moment.\" I've worked with pizza before, I understand how busy it gets.\n\nI ordered a pizza, a side, and went on my way home. I checked my side and realized it wasn't what I ordered. So I went back, told the same lady that my side must have gotten mixed up. She seemed very stressed and apologized many times, and even gave me the other side completely free of charge. She was so absolutely sweet and understanding. The food tasted great and made me feel better after a rough day.\n\nPlease be kind to all those who work here and in fast food in general. They work in the heat under a lot of pressure and are very understanding if you are kind enough, especially during busy times like the holidays. Definitely come to this place if you're looking for great service! \ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udf55 I've been ordering here for the past 14 years and always loved them because its dominos, and whats to hate. But over the past few months the food has been disappointing, especially the wings. The wings are either cold, or just straight up bad. The toppings are lacking as hell, and the delivery has kind of been wild. Idk, I've loved this dominos forever, and I don't know what's happened to it. I ordered take away, but the manager brought me a seat, and it was just as the Celtics game was getting out , great atmosphere, although they got smoked at home by the clippers.  It's on Staniford Street NEAR the Red Hat I ordered via Uber so I didn\u2019t physically go to Domino\u2019s. The pizza was great! I ordered the gluten free crust and made my own pizza. The delivery guy was very nice and my order was delivered very fast!\ud83d\ude01 The restaurant is really nice , the atmosphere really gets you into the Spanish vibe, the service was great , and the food was cooked infront of you.\nAs for the food I got a lengua torta, and let me tell you it\u2019s one of the bests one I\u2019ve had. The bread was soft but crispy, the meat was seasoned well and with a lot of cheese added in. The spicy sauce was delicious it reminded me of a Spanish candy but better. The fresh cilantro sauce really cleans your pallet for the heaviness of the food So I was looking for a place to eat for lunch when I came across chilacates. At first I thought it was a New Mexican restaurant but when I arrived I realized it\u2019s the previous Mexican place that was there but with a rebrand. The counter lady was clearly overwhelmed which lead to a line of people waiting to place their orders. I got the chicken burrito with the flan. The burrito was full but poorly wrapped. The tortilla was very chewy as well. The flan was very hard, not firm but hard. The add insult to injury I had to go to the fridge and grab my own flan just for the counter could place it in the bag. I guess I work part time here too \ud83d\ude02\n\nHonestly I would not recommend it for the price. After reading the mixed reviews, we still decided to try it out since we were craving Mexican food\u2026 we are blown away!!! The tacos are probably the best tacos I\u2019ve ever had. We also got the gueros tacos and the tostada\u2014 all of the meat quality was top notch. Tastes like authentic Mexican food with so much flavour. 10/10 Elevated casual taqueria experience with solid food.\n\nChilacates expanded aggressively throughout the city last year, and this West End location was one of them. Although I haven\u2019t visited their original Amory Street location, this new outpost impressed with its comfortable seatings and a clean, modern interior. I came a couple times before TD garden events and always had a solid meal.\n\nAlthough Chilacates is more known for their burritos among the locals, I got to try some of their other offerings on the menu. The Taco Plate and Carne Asada Quesadilla, in particular, were some of my favorites. The Birria in the burrito bowl was also soft and tender, but the beans were slightly undercooked, giving them a harder texture than preferred.\n\nFrom their dessert and drinks, both the churros and the horchata were great. Horchata had a slightly stronger cinnamon flavor compared to what you might find at other taquerias around the city, but it was still refreshing.\n\nWith its rapid expansion, Chilacates now rivals chains like Chipotle in number in Boston. If you\u2019re looking for a more authentic Mexican experience, Chilacates is a compelling alternative with its more diversified menu. It may not be the best Mexican food in the city, but it\u2019s good enough to fulfill Mexican food cravings. Better than most burrito nearby. Love both red and green hot sauce OK so for a rail station pizza it's 5 star.   It's simple and clean to start with.  Friendly fast service.  And great ingredients.   They have to make it ahead of time because they cater to people walking thru in a hurry.   But the flavor and crust are very good.  Thank you Crazy Doug's pizza...  keep up the good work. My wife and I were going To Bruno Mars concert and we were really hungry,  waiting on line to enter we saw crazy Dough'S pizza what such presentation and great amazing pizza, delicious wow. I'd go again and again. I would love to franchise and grow with it also. The pizza tasted like it had been heated up and frozen multiple times before being heated up for me. You're better off going to a place like NYP or Sal's for some good pizza, both of which are within 5 minute walking distance. their pizzas are not bad they have lots of interesting kinds and flavors but their drinks are not really worth it their like the size of a 1st graders cup only about i think 12oz they are really small better off  buying a 20oz soda at the news stand place across the concourse or a large coke from mcdonalds  before hand the prices are also pretty good under 8$ for 2 slices and the tiny drink not really all that bad at least they are tasty! maybe if all you want is a quick one slice they are good  but dont expect the cups to be worth the price their only good because of the free refills apart from that buy your sodas elsewhere i hate how their ONE size only and THAT small. Metal shavings were in my pizza - I thought the crust contained hard parmasean cheese that was difficult to chew.  I expected the quality to be poor, the operation is located in a train station and so I dealt with it.  I finally spit a bite out out near the end of the pizza and found that it was metal shavings. I am very concerned about others that ate here. bread was not toasted and and avocado was spread poorly As far as Dunks goes, this one is fine. The wait can be long and it's 30% more than most other locations but I don't know what you expected in North Station. My advice is to order in advance on the app and use an offer or points to pay, because the rate is the same regardless of how much that location marks everything up. Just got a $5 cup of pink ice water instead of a nice dunkins refresher after work. I have had nothing but horrible experiences at dunks inside north station. Should be illegal to be that bad at your services you provide. Ordered two lattes. One had the wrong milk and neither tasted like they had any coffee in them Usually, it's a late opening. It opens at 6 am, but it's usually late. Late being 6:30. There's usually 3-4 staff working to open. Had a great time watching a Celtics game with friends here! The food was alright, but the service was great. Michael was super friendly and helpful, checking on us consistently throughout the night and making sure we were enjoying ourselves. Would definitely come back! Absolutely awesome sports bar! As a visitor from Germany, I was hoping to catch the Bayern Munich game \u2013 and the staff went out of their way to make it happen. They switched one of the TVs just for me, even though it wasn\u2019t a local game. Super friendly service, great atmosphere, and plenty of screens to watch whatever you\u2019re into. Can\u2019t recommend this place enough \u2013 they made me feel right at home! Eating at upper level bar lounge before Bruins game. We got a table right off, which was nice given the busy timing. However the waitress was untrained in how to manage the order of service for multiple tables. (it was hard to watch given that I\u2019ve been a waitress for years.) We both got the burger, which looked and sounded great. It was made to order which was nice. However, way too big for the bun and super messy (see pic). Really dry needed either more cheese or something else to not make it not so dry. French fries were awesome! We had Michael as a server and he was great! Michael made sure we had everything we needed and provided great recommendations, super personable! This is our second time coming here before going to see games at TD Garden and couldn\u2019t recommend more. The food is reasonably priced and staff are always welcoming and friendly. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for pub style food before the game and a social atmosphere. Stopped in here to have a few libations before watching the 4 Nations Face-off. Huge flat-screen tvs, the place was packed before the start of the game. Service was good! bread was not toasted and and avocado was spread poorly As far as Dunks goes, this one is fine. The wait can be long and it's 30% more than most other locations but I don't know what you expected in North Station. My advice is to order in advance on the app and use an offer or points to pay, because the rate is the same regardless of how much that location marks everything up.

It opens at 6 am, but it's usually late. Late being 6:30. There's usually 3-4 staff working to open. Awesome! Stopped in for dinner. Clean, well lit. Comfortable high table seating. Greeted by professional friendly hostess. Waitstaff also professional, friendly, courteous, polite and attentive. Great menu. Ordered the special, duck with ramen and the spicy wontons, sticky ribs and soft shell crab roll. Hardly any wait. Food arrived less than10 minutes. Piping hot and absolutely delicious and prepared perfectly. Another spot added to my list of go-to\u2019s. Will definitely return to try the other items on the menu. Highly recommend. Momosan is a chain restaurant by Modern day Iron Chef Morimoto, who has a wide range of restaurants across the United States. This one services Hub Hall, the food hall located under TD Garden.\n\nThe staff are friendly here, though there may be some inconsistencies of what times food is available (we came once and although it said it was open, the entire dining area was closed except for the bar due to lack of staff)\n\nThe food is alright. It definitely is better than instant quality or frozen quality, but the food does tend to be a bit oily or lacking high quality flavor. For the price, the portion size is ok, though may leave some room for more to be desired. The food tastes good though, with them serving the signature ribs from his other restaurants as well as Peking Duck. Definitely worth at least one visit to try things out. It\u2019s expensive but it\u2019s at the train station so what do you expect?\n\nHowever, it was quite delicious actually, sushi had a great flavor & wonderful texture. Everything seemed fresh. I had an allergy that was accommodated and I was able to add a vegetable to my roll without a big up charge.\n\nBartender was super helpful and all in all it was a good experience Momosan is a chain restaurant by Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto and this one is the only proper restaurant in North Station\u2019s Hub Hall.\nWe went right after a Celtics game finished, so it was very crowded but the service was quick and attentive.\n\nWe tried the Pork Gyoza, Spicy Wontons, Spicy Tonkotsu and Spicy Dan Dan noodles.  The Pork Gyoza came with sizzling hot oil, but was otherwise unremarkable.  The spicy chickens wontons were very bland and the oil made them feel too greasy.  Both appetizers were a let down.\n\nThe Tonkotsu ramen was quite tasty.  The noodles were cooked well and the broth was properly seasoned and did not feel too salty or heavy.  Our issue was the kakuni braised pork belly, which was rather bland and either very chewy or too fatty.   It was not the best ramen we have had, but still very good.\n\nThe spicy Dan Dan noodles were also very tasty and probably seasoned.  The noodles were perfectly cooked but we had the same issues with the kakuni braised pork belly as in the Tankotsu ramen. Momosan Ramen Boston delivers an authentic and delicious Asian dining experience with a menu that showcases creativity and bold flavors. Their appetizers are a standout\u2014the Sticky Ribs are rich and tender, the Shot Oil Fish Carpaccio is delicate yet flavorful, the Spicy Wontons pack just the right amount of heat, and the Kakuni Bao is perfectly balanced with its soft bun and savory filling.\n\nThe All-Star Ramen is a must-try, featuring a well-crafted broth and high-quality ingredients that come together beautifully in every bite. To complement the meal, their cocktails are equally impressive, offering a great variety of well-mixed drinks that enhance the dining experience.\n\nFor those looking to grab a quick bite before a game or concert, Momosan Ramen is the place to be. The service is quick and efficient, making it easy to enjoy a satisfying meal without feeling rushed. With its flavorful dishes, creative menu, and excellent location, this spot is definitely worth checking out! Hub Hall, conveniently located adjacent to Boston's North Station, offers a vibrant and accessible dining experience, especially for travelers arriving via the commuter line or metro from the airport. This sophisticated food court houses a variety of culinary options, each providing a unique taste of Boston's diverse food scene.\n\nDuring my visit, I indulged in the fish and chips from Sullivan's Castle Island booth. Despite its absence from internet and some maps (google), this booth delivers a delightful rendition of the classic dish, with crispy fries and perfectly battered  fish. The interior of Hub Hall is uniquely designed, fostering a communal atmosphere where sharing tables with strangers feels natural and adds to the experience.\n\nThe clientele is a mix of busy locals and visitors, all seeking a quick yet satisfying meal. The bustling environment reflects the city's dynamic energy, making it an ideal spot for a brief respite amidst the day's activities. Whether you're a tourist or a local, Hub Hall provides a pleasurable dining experience that captures the essence of Boston's culinary and cultural vibrancy.\u200b\u200b I only went to Momosan Morimoto but I had a chance to explore further after seeing the Celtics. Momosan Morimoto was good and I really liked the Tokyo \ud83d\uddfc Chicken \ud83d\udc14 Ramen.\nThere were a lot of decorations through the Hall. There is a cafe here as well.\nThe Hall is busy on Saturdays and I guess during Celtics games. I want to visit again either to try a different restaurant or try the sushi \ud83c\udf63 at Momosan Morimoto. Today, I was in the midst of eating my Dunkin breakfast, peacefully, in Hub Hall,  when a security guard very quietly informed me that outside food is not permitted. I have been doing this exact same activity for the past year without any interference of any kind. He approached me a second time and repeated his message, which was ineffective, because he expected me to leave but didn\u2019t say so in so many words. I think he was looking for an argument when just effectively getting his point across would have helped immensely. There were no signs posted anywhere. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered to enter, knowing that guard would have been so hostile. We had a couple drinks at Now Pouring -\nBartender Jackson was a cool guy and made us some stiff/refreshing cocktails.  Great food options. Rowdy and overfilled, it provides a needed more affordable and speedy food spot for pre-Celtics/Garden event. We barely found seating but in the end got a table. Paid for pizza slices that were slightly more than I\u2019d have liked in price but given the venue it was understandable. It was also solid food. Would be happy to bank on this option again. I did self check out.\nThere\u2019s a  guy (wearing glasses )  walking around,  talking to himself, , acting weird. probably got hight. standing behind customers  quietly and creepily. counting their  items, making sure they are  matching with the screen. So creepy. Absolutely the worst.  Rude store personnel.  The clipped coupons don't register.  Safeway needs to improve their website.\n\nWould anyone else be interested in a lawsuit against them for false advertisement.  The digital coupons don't work when I get to the register. Random - They have better jackfruit then the 6 Asian grocery stores I\u2019ve been to in Boston. And it\u2019s somehow cheaper here too.\n\nLove this grocery store.

Do your job and get it done right!\n\n...prices are expensive already at this location! Great indoor rowing studio and easily accessible location in Boston, MA. Evonne and Kayla are great instructors! Outdoor rowing is a new experience for us, but the backdrop was great and fresh air while rowing.\nThank you Steve. I took a class at Row House and it was amazing. The studio is so nice, the staff is helpful and the instructor motivating. A great workout in a very scenic spot. Really enjoyed the outdoor class. Highly recommend this no impact yet satisfying workout! 5/5 I fell in love since my first class and already signed up! The coaches are so engaging with us and the music and tell you how to improve to row better and faster. Both outdoor and indoor scenarios are great. Outdoor you get the water view and headphones, while indoor you have the music and cool lights! Super coaches to try your first or other classes: Monique, Haley, and Evonne! Try, rowing, it's worth it \ud83d\udea3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I started rowing for the first time at the end of May. I needed to find a way to increase my cardio workout. After the first class I was hooked. A little less than 3 months later, more than 250K kilometers completed and I've enjoyed my time of the wharf. 3 or more mornings a week, out on the wharf, you watch the boats and water as you row.\n\nThe classes are all different, they include strength training, either body weight or dumb bells is a great complement.  In the past I've done spinning, but this combination of strength and cardio gives you a more rounded workout.\n\nThe coaches are all incredible, consistent and looking to help you achieve your best results. Fitness here is so fun!  Coaches are passionate, extremely encouraging and total pros. I\u2019ve been rowing for many years at CrossFit. Then found this place and takes my rowing to the next level. Row together with the whole class, to the beat of the music and the meters just keep racking up and the 45 min is done in a flash. Time flies when you\u2019re rowing at row house.  Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for low impact, high fun fitness. Rowing experience not necessary, these coaches will teach you the way. I called before my membership renewal date to cancel because I was very sick and they didn\u2019t let me cancel unless I came in person. I came in person when I felt a bit better, but it was just after the payment renewed and the manager insisted I would have to pay for yet another month despite my efforts to cancel on time. I would have rated them higher before this because there were a couple instructors I liked, but the manager\u2019s money-focused gimmicks were high pressure and tone deaf. Now I don\u2019t want to come back to any Title Boxing franchise at all and I\u2019m being forced to waste more money than I should. They tell me it\u2019s just their policy so you can expect this at any location. I have been paying for about three months worth of membership when I have come in to cancel and also called to communicate with someone to just get me out of the commitment of paying for a membership of a gym I never go to. They said since the pay were already made, I just have to come in person again to cancel. Totally unprofessional on their end and would definitely not go back considering my consistency to stop being in this boxing club. I would only recommend this gym as a good way to relieve stress or anger healthily, but otherwise this place is a total money grab. I just joined at the beginning of February and I\u2019ve really enjoyed the classes I\u2019ve taken. The facility itself is very clean and has a good vibe. I\u2019ve liked each individual instructor that I\u2019ve had; they all have their own style but each instructor has been very motivating and brings a good energy to the class. I never knew a boxing gym would\u2019ve been my style, but I already feel that this is something that is easy to incorporate into my life; it\u2019s an awesome workout and a perfect stress reliever! Each class is a good experience, the instructors always give motivation and are helping and interacting with everyone.. the place is very clean and the workers are always attentive and friendly, I love my boxing classes! I\u2019ve been a member for a few months and enjoy this place. Friendly staff. Inclusive space. Very welcoming to all abilities and age. I especially enjoy the custom Superman designed boxing gloves! You\u2019ll go in feeling stressed and come out feeling better after a class."

    "reviews": "Stepping into Regina\u2019s in the North End feels like stepping into a slice of pizza history. The original location has that old-school charm\u2014tight booths, checkered floors, and walls lined with vintage photos that remind you this place has been doing it right since 1926.\n\nThe pizza? Absolutely worth the hype. The crust is the perfect balance of crispy and chewy, with that signature char from the brick oven that gives it so much character. We ordered a classic pepperoni and a white pizza\u2014both were phenomenal. The sauce is rich and tangy, the cheese perfectly melted and bubbling, and the toppings generous but not overdone.\n\nService is quick, no-frills, and efficient\u2014exactly what you\u2019d expect and want at a place like this. It\u2019s casual, a little chaotic, but full of energy and tradition.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Boston and even remotely into pizza, this place is non-negotiable. It\u2019s a must-visit institution that lives up to the legacy. Just be prepared to wait\u2014especially on weekends\u2014but it\u2019s 100% worth it. You have to visit the original location to Regina Pizzeria when visiting Boston's North End.\n\nThis was my second time eating here. When I came here years ago, we ordered a large cheese pizza and I remember being blown away. I remember thinking to myself it was the best pizza l'd ever had.\n\nThis time around I ordered a couple of slices and unfortunately didn't have that same reaction, however they were still good. But comparable to what you get from a Regina's at the mall...\n\nI do love the interior of this place, it still looks original and has lots of character. I sat at a tiny table next to the bar and had a great time. My server was attentive and my order came out quickly.\n\nDefinitely order a pie when you come here, it's fresh and you'll be happy. Even if you're solo, order a small pie... trust me!\n\nPS. No free refills on soda. Every bite is absolutely delicious. Highly recommend. Long line out the door for indoor seating. Call ahead and order, even if it's for a slice or two. The cheese was velvety goodness. All the ingredients combined made for an amazing slice of pizza. 10 out of 10 would eat again. Regina Pizzeria is a great local restaurant.  It felt like everyone in there has eaten there a hundred times.  Yet it has a reputation that draws visitors to it, and for good reason.  We had two pizzas:  pepperoni and broccoli aglio e olio.  Both were delicious.  The service was excellent.  Although there was a long line, they served people quickly and turned over tables at a fast rate. Our tour guide (Dave with Hub Town Tours) recommended we try Regina\u2019s Pizzaria. He said it\u2019s simply the best pizza in the world \ud83d\ude0a. So we tried it and Dave wasn\u2019t wrong. It\u2019s a very small place but the atmosphere is so North end Boston and very cool. The walls are decorated with hundreds of police, fire department and other services badges from all over the country making an interesting and patriotic display. Our pizza had the best crust - thin, crunchy and melts in your mouth. The sausage, green peppers and onions were fresh and the tomato sauce came right out of Mom\u2019s kitchen. The service was excellent and the price a great value. Don\u2019t forget to dip your crust in the special oil concoction on your table. It\u2019s delicious! I highly recommend Regina\u2019s the next time you crave the best pizza in the world! \ud83c\udfc6 This is definitely a very welcoming place. If i lived in Boston, I'd be a regular there. It seems like a place that gets pretty busy and is absolutely worth the wait. I had steak, eggs and home fries which were very good. The staff seems to know a vast majority of their customers, which is really nice to see, and even as an out of towner, I'd love to come back if I am in Boston again.\n\nPros:\n\nFriendly, welcoming staff\nDelicious food\nCost is not crazy\nClean place\nThere is a restroom\n\nCons:\nStreet parking, which is very limited I saw the high praise on yelp and TA and thought we\u2019d give it a try, but as we were walking past all the Italian places in little Italy I started wondering if we\u2019d made a mistake\u2026surely we should eat at one of them? Then we saw how tiny it was and almost turned right around. But there was one table open right by the door, and I am SO glad we made the effort to squeeze inside! Everyone was so kind and accommodating, even though with a 2yo we weren\u2019t the easiest guests.\n\nTheo came over and said hi to our little one several times and then surprised her with a Mickey pancake all decorated. She was so excited!\n\nIt was so nice to have such a chill local place to be treated like family and it was worth the walk and the close quarters\u2026all part of the charm.\n\nAlso, the food was amazing. I\u2019d sworn off keeping leftovers this trip just because of convenience, but you better believe I took home the several slices of French toast I didn\u2019t finish. It was delicious and beautiful! The whole family felt the same about their meals. First time visitor while in town for a wedding. We arrived to a crowded establishment. The place is small and tightly packed with people. We were met by friendly staff and immediate seating at the counter.\n\nWe ordered the big boy (pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, and toast) and an omelette. Everything was good. The pancakes were better than IHOP.  The food arrived fast and hot. The portions were nice and price was reasonable.\n\nThey only take cash so have some on hand. Parking in the area is tight. We drove around for quite a while before finding a parking spot. Found this little gem in the little Italy section. Doesn\u2019t look like much from the outside, but the food coming from the inside is outstanding. Theo cooking on the grill makes magic. Great selections on the menu for breakfast. Prepared to order hot and fresh. Generous portions at a great price. Well, it is very small and cramped inside. It is also extremely welcoming and like home. Bring cash as they do not take credit cards and come early because the line starts quick. Highly recommend. I had to have special two eggs, bacon, potatoes,, and toast with coffee. Coffee was great and refills a plenty. My total bill was just over $15, which is extremely reasonable for Boston! Amazing place for early morning breakfast.\nVeggie omelette with Turkey bacon strips. Fantastic combination to kick start my day this morning.\nSmall cafe. But worth visiting for Bostonians.  Must try chef\u2019s special homemade hot sauce. This has been my favorite place in the north end for many years. It was a busy Friday night and we didn\u2019t have a reservation, but were lucky enough to score two seats at the bar downstairs. We enjoyed Clams Casino and Artichoke Margarita for appetizers . Our main dishes were Escarole Fagioli  and the Shrimp Margarita. Everything was absolutely delicious! Our bartender/server Marysa was so much fun to talk to as well as delivering impeccable service. They offer a wonderful wine selection and full bar. Lots of North End energy in the atmosphere. Thanks for a great night! In Boston\u2019s North End Italian restaurant is a hidden gem. I\u2019ve been to 5 different Italian restaurants in the area and Massimino\u2019s is my favorite hands down! I\u2019m always on the hunt for a great authentic Italian restaurant, which is very hard to find nowadays, unfortunately!\n\nThe inside is small but they do have seating downstairs. The smaller setting allows for a more 1:1 feel. There are folding doors that open to allow fresh air to come in which I enjoy! The bathrooms are clean and the inside was fairly clean.\n\nThe service was average. My waitress Katrina was polite and checked in on me. She asked if I had questions about the menu.\n\nThe food was fresh and authentic. I got an Aperol Spritz, Bruschetta that had fresh cut tomatoes and garlic, main meal was Penne Al vodka sauce, and I finished with a cannoli. Everything was made to perfection with all fresh tasting ingredients.\n\nThis was my fourth visit to Massimino\u2019s and every time is better than the last visit! I highly recommend giving Massimino\u2019s a try, it\u2019s completely worth the walk/drive! Until next time\u2026.cheers \ud83e\udd42 It is pretty tight in here but that is fine because it\u2019s always great company. The people who work here are so nice (I assume mostly family run), the food is delicious, and the vibes immaculate (especially if you get to sit downstairs). This is our go-to meal before we hit TD Garden for a game. Great service and such a charming little restaurant. Food was good and a very robust never. No fault of the restaurant but it was insanely loud inside. Some of the other diners were very loud to the point where one couldn't hear. I even used a decibel monitor and it got upwards of 86 + decibels inside which is the equivalent of loud traffic. If you want a quiet place to eat, this may not be it. Very good Italian in North End. Too many options on the menu. We settled on linguine with little neck clams and shrimp. Both white and red sauce. We also had gnocchi massimono which came in  Garlicky/lemon sauce. Despite the fact that most of the original Italian familes have spread out to other parts of Bostom the area retains many restaurants salumerias and churches that defined the life of this Little Italy. The restaurants in particular retain an authenticity that attracts visitors. Parking is however a problem so parking further away and walking is probably a good idea. I love the shops there! I found a dessert shop and a fresh pasta shop! I was traveling so I can\u2019t bring the pasta home, but I got to take a picture and show people about it! The highlight for me is the \u201cElderly SLOW crossing\u201d sigh! At the time when I saw the sign, there were 3 elderly ladies sitting on the bench sun bathing near the sign\ud83d\ude06. I wish I took that picture too! One major problem is parking.  Recommend that you park just outside of Little Italy and walk half a mile.  It will take less time than driving around looking for parking. A special, historical area of \u200b\u200bthe city with interesting architecture and many Italian cafes and restaurants. I recommend visiting! Little Italy expresses its deepest and most authentic Italian cuisine with love to the beautiful city of Boston. The food, and restaurants deliver the best atmosphere and the culture is purely about showcasing the Italian culture to the public, without having to travel to Italy. Great place for the weekend. Definitely worth the try! Happy to check this one off my list of discovering new coffee shops in Boston. Conveniently a short walk away from North Station. Good mix of teas, coffee, and espresso options. I got the vanilla latte and it was perfectly sweet where I still taste the coffee. Will try the pastries and breakfast options next time! The young man at the counter was   polite and cheerful. Received our food quickly, the bagel was nicely toasted, bacon crisp and egg was not runny. I added an expresso shot to the drip coffee to give it a little kick. We would definitely go back. Caff\u00e9 Ducali \u2013 North End\u2019s Go-To Spot for a Proper Italian Coffee\n\nAlright, listen up\u2014if you\u2019re in Boston and you haven\u2019t hit Caff\u00e9 Ducali yet, you\u2019re seriously missing out. This ain\u2019t your basic chain coffee shop\u2014this place is the real deal, bringing that authentic Italian caf\u00e9 experience right to the North End, and let me tell ya, they do it right.\n\nThe Coffee \u2013 Absolute Perfection\nFirst things first\u2014the coffee. Flawless. They serve up rich, smooth espresso that\u2019ll wake you up better than a slap from a Southie grandmother. Whether you\u2019re grabbing a classic cappuccino, a strong macchiato, or one of their seasonal lattes, every sip tastes like it came straight outta Italy. And if you\u2019re more of an iced coffee kinda person? They got you. Their iced drinks are bold, smooth, and never watered down. No burnt nonsense like some other places we won\u2019t name.\n\nThe Food \u2013 More Than Just a Coffee Shop\nNow, you come here for the coffee, but let me tell ya, you\u2019ll stick around for the food. They\u2019ve got a rotating selection of fresh-baked pastries that actually taste homemade\u2014flaky, buttery, and just the right amount of sweet. The breakfast sandwiches? Forget about it. Perfectly toasted, stacked with high-quality ingredients, and exactly what you need to start the day right.\n\nAnd if you swing by for lunch, they got paninis, fresh salads, and their famous Roman-style pizza al taglio (by the slice). And this ain\u2019t just any pizza\u2014it\u2019s crispy, airy, cheesy goodness that\u2019ll make you wonder why you ever settled for anything less. Bonus points for the fact that it comes straight from their sister spot, Ducali Pizzeria & Bar, which is already legendary.\n\nThe Vibe \u2013 Cool, Clean, and Classy\nYou walk in, and it\u2019s got that sleek, modern, but still welcoming feel. White subway tiles, marble countertops, and huge garage-style windows that flood the place with light\u2014it\u2019s the kind of spot where you wanna sip your coffee slow and soak in the atmosphere. It\u2019s got that perfect mix of European caf\u00e9 culture and classic Boston charm.\n\nThe Service \u2013 Friendly, Fast, and No Nonsense\nBoston service can be a hit or miss, but here? They treat you right. The baristas actually know what they\u2019re doing, and they move fast\u2014but not in a \u201crush you out the door\u201d kinda way. They care about what they\u2019re serving, and you can tell. Whether you\u2019re a regular or a first-timer, they\u2019ll make you feel at home.\n\nThe Verdict \u2013 Must-Visit, No Excuses\nLook, bottom line\u2014Caff\u00e9 Ducali is the kind of place Boston needed. It\u2019s got killer coffee, bomb food, and an atmosphere that makes you wanna hang out all day. Whether you\u2019re grabbing a quick espresso on your way to work, meeting up with friends, or just looking for a solid spot to sit and enjoy a great cup of coffee, this is the place to be.\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Easily one of the best coffee spots in the city. Go once, and I guarantee you\u2019ll be back. Cute spot for a quick coffee and something small to eat. The menu has a small list of available items but it is tasty for what it has. A few tables inside to dine in. Uninspired.\n\nThe staff were not at all pleased to have a job. The gelato was pretty poor quality compared to other places. It was squarely average. I wouldn\u2019t return if I could help it."

    "reviews": "Great whiskey museum with a great selection of bourbon for viewing. Sadly, it's priced above even the secondary market prices if you actually were hoping to buy anything from the store. Most standard bottles on the shelf were higher priced as well. There are other stores in the nearby area that charge near msrp for their liquor and those places won't gouge you on the allocated bottles when they come around. Great store. Great service. Kerry A and Abbey are the best. They helped design the wild duck Patriots sweatshirts and the storefronts. Ezio is also great. He is so helpful when customers have questions. It is an interesting store with more than just alcohol. Tourists love the tee shirts. Make sure to pick yours up today! First time in Boston. Alex behind the counter should have been making commission on the restaurant fare, as well as helping us tourists with the touristy stuff!\n\nWe found a nice wine selection, and for me a good bourbon menu with lots of options at several price points. Shady bag charge practice. I brought my own bag, and declined a bag from the store. I asked for a receipt and was shocked to see I was still charged for a bag. When I asked for a refund the cashier was rude and unapologetic. Have been a customer for years and will be cautious to return. The guys working the store were crazy chill and nice, I would go back just for the service. A wonderful neighborhood grocery store (cash only, by the way). A little bit of everything for sure. The owner is very friendly. Awful establishment. They allowed someone to use my stolen info to purchase items here and manually enter the card number in without the physical card. Who allows someone to manually enter a card, that should have been a major red flag!!! At least ask for identification Great little bodega! Very friendly people. The big plus is they sell beer and wine which is scarce in this section of north end! Great place to get snacks or basic needs. They also have beer and wine. Super friendly neighborhood staple. We loved Bob's grocery store!  Rented an apt for our vacay and Bob's had just what we needed for breakfast and snacks!  The owners are so friendly, too! Small Italian bakery shop. You can pay in\nCard, only if the bill is above 10$!They are known for Italian sweets and pastries. However, they don\u2019t have much sitting arrangements and not even a restroom! The ladies seem a little unfriendly ! However, the Boston cream pie and other pastries are good. The lobster tail was big and too sweet for me. However, I would recommend the place for cannoli. Stop by, if you are around. Pretty good canoli. Thick ricota cream taste. size is good. Not huge. Good flovour. Small shop but good taste of food. It different then mikes pastry. But it still good~ when u ask canoil they will make fresh one right away. This is it. The search is over. Cannoli!!! Italian cookies!!! Get in my belly. Tears in my eyes. Did you know they ship cookies? They know how to do it. I enjoy the comments about people saying the ladies are not friendly. Pull up your pants! You are in Boston!!! Good Italian bakery with great cannolis and praline. Not busy at all like Hanover St. which was a nice change. Ladies at the counter were not the friendliest or talkative at all. This is real deal pastry shop and plz don't fall for some tourist pastry shop's nearby. Just wish little more dessert options available but 5 stars for everything we ate over there. My new go to when in the area. Most laundry mats nearby only offer coin operated. Didn't have cash and went through the hassle of finding an ATM, so was relieved when this spot offered card operated machines. Prices are affordable, especially for a student like myself. I never leave reviews, but I would go out of my way to give zero stars to this place. The staff, especially the guy who\u2019s there a lot, are incredibly rude. Most of their machines are out of order and leave weird stains on your clothes. Their dryers don\u2019t dry everything all the way, and then they make you pay extra to add time. They also never clean the machines, and I\u2019ve found nasty stuff in them on multiple occasions. Their card machine has been down for months, so you can only use cash. I wouldn\u2019t be as harsh if it were affordable, but the prices are absolutely ridiculous. Will never come back. If I could give this place zero stars I would. The staff is incredibly rude, the machines often don\u2019t work, and the prices are very expensive considering the awful service and old machines. On top of that I tried their drop off laundry service (because their machines are so bad) and half of my clothes came back ruined. Avoid this place at all costs - it\u2019s not worth the frustration. Would give 0 stars if possible. The woman working at this laundromat was unpleasant, unhelpful, and extremely rude. No change given, so need to go to the store down the road. The woman didn\u2019t explain we had to buy a card just to use the facilities, and charged us $2 for this. Overall for a small wash and dry, she charged us $14, that\u2019s for us doing it ourselves. The dryer was slow, and we had to add more money. In the time we were there, we witnessed two separate groups arguing with the woman, they both left without even using the facilities, we wished we had done the same. AVOID Very nice, quiet, clean place for laundry, with extremely helpful staff and reasonable prices (note that I am from SF, so my idea of reasonable may not be the same as yours). This is probably the fanciest looking laundromat I have ever been to--the location and the decor are way too cute for just a place to wash clothes--and as a bonus, it wasn't filled with screaming children. There is a wash/dry/fold service as well for those who don't have time to wait and $1.25/lb to burn, and single load packs of detergent are available at the vending machine, which accepts the same laundry card ($2 for a new one) as the washers and dryers. This really is a great spot, if nothing else because you can grab a cannoli from Mike's around the corner as you wait for your clothes. Ample vegan options and staff are knowledgeable (even the wines are labelled vegan!) Cozy, warm, romantic ambiance, filled with professional and friendly people. We were rushed out of our table as soon as we had eaten and paid so just beware of that. Otherwise recommend! We ate here in April 2025. A member of our party of three made a reservation on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty when we arrived at 5:00pm. People came and went while we were there and it never did fill up.\n\nMy partner and I both had the misto salad, which seemed to lack any sort of dressing. It was moderately fresh, the texture seemed like the salads were made ahead of time and refrigerated until served.\n\nI had the ragu Bolognese pappardelle, thinking it would be meaty. It was not. It was pretty bland. The server was pretty stingy with the fresh ground black pepper and rushed away from the table after a couple of turns of the grinder so I was not able to ask for more before the pasta got cold.\n\nMy partner had the much acclaimed veal chop. He found it to be very tender and also bland, although he said the mushrooms on top had flavor. It makes a spectacular presentation, but the flavor was lacking.\n\nOur friend had the lamb shank which she reported was also very tender and nearly flavor free.\n\nOur wine was as described on the menu and we were content with our choices.\n\nWe each ordered a dessert. I had the flourless chocolate cake. It was a thin sliver with what tasted like Hershey's syrup drizzled over it. Not my thing. My partner had the bread pudding. He reported that the bread part was good but the caramel sauce was too sweet for his taste. The restaurant does not have coffee or espresso, which would have helped us to cut the sweetness of the desserts. \"No hot drinks.\"\n\nFood is such a matter of expectation and preference that all I can say is that this was not what we prefer and we were disappointed. Other diners around us seemed to be enjoying their meals, so to each his own. Just a superb delectable selection of vegan and several gluten free items. Th favorites were the bean dip for bread, gnocchi al fungi, rigatoni and the eggplant soy vegan meatballs. The mushroom risotto is not to be missed. Service was friendly warm and eager to share favorites- definitely coming back. Terramia Ristorante in Boston\u2019s North End is a cozy, candlelit spot with classic Italian charm. The owner and staff are incredibly welcoming, offering friendly service. The food is outstanding\u2014don\u2019t miss the open-faced ravioli if you love seafood, and the veal chop is flavorful and generously portioned. It\u2019s the perfect place for an intimate, authentic Italian meal. Excellent food, great options for plant-based folks like me! The cannellini bean dip they serve with bread as a snack is delish. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Loved it! We ended up in Boston for a couple nights recently and upon arriving, we started looking for a place to get dinner. A good friend who lives outside the city was with me and suggested La Famiglia Giorgio\u2019s due to its popularity so we decided to stop by.\n\nCame at around 6:15 PM on a Saturday and they were SLAMMED. There were tons of people waiting for a table and the whole entryway was full. We were given about a 45 min-1 hour wait for a table to which we were seated in about that time. Our waitress was nice and gave some great menu suggestions. The dining room is a little crammed but it suited our table well. We started with the calamari and gnocchi as appetizers. The calamari was crispy and tasty and the gnocchi was really good too! Quite huge portions of it as well!\n\nMe and my sister then shared the Chicken Parmigiana as our meal. Overall, I was blown away! The sauce was flavorful, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the pasta was good, and it was a MASSIVE portion too! Neither of us could finish it all. All around, it was fantastic.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re in the North End of Boston looking for some good Italian, La Famiglia Giorgio\u2019s is a great spot! They may be slammed frequently, but they still run the place like a well oiled machine! I\u2019ll be back. Fantastic restaurant with wonderful hospitality and great food. We popped in for a birthday dinner without a specific reservation and were able to get seated quickly. Their Margherita pizza is amazing and my friend had their chicken parm. Portion sizes are beyond comprehension and more than what you get billed for. I really liked their multi-level setup and the cozy atmosphere here. Great choices of wine and cocktails too. Definitely one of those places that you can\u2019t go wrong with in the North End. I can\u2019t recommend this place enough. The food is FANTASTIC. The portions are big and everything is so fresh and delicious. The calamari was the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life. We shared the eggplant/chicken parm combo with rigatoni and it was wonderful. Don\u2019t leave without ordering a cappuccino - it was delicious. I WILL be back!! Arrived without a reservation and promptly seated upstairs. Wasn\u2019t aware the second floor existed but it was a good atmosphere. Our server was excellent and the meals event better. They were both very large!  Nice wine selection also. Will definitely be back! Came for dinner while visiting Boston for the first time. Did not disappoint. The lasagna was so good as was the veal Marsala. Portions are huge and definitely worth the price. Everyone was super nice from the moment we walked in. Our server Joseph was also great as well and answered all questions I had. Would definitely come back if I\u2019m ever back in town Delicious subs, worth the hype!\n\nWent to get a sub for dinner and almost no line, massive sandwich with good quality bread. All the toppings were layered well with a good amount of each, their specialty ones are worth a try too. Definitely up there as one of the best places in the north end, worth the $20! Excellent sandwiches, but a long wait time if ordering in store. The trick is to order online and pick up. Also  be advised  there are not tables to eat at. Everything is \" to go\". There's not a lot of public areas in the near vicinity either, to sit down at. But tbe sandwiches are actually excellent, so well worth 4 stars Boston luch decided to go to the North end to get something Italian. Local family recommended Mercado for sub sandwich. Wow they are big and delicious. Ordered steak tips with barbecue sauce and cheese, caprese, which is cold, and meatball sub. All were amazing. Little on the expensive side at $20 each but worth the try and eat. It gets busy. They also sell deli meats. It was a great experience to wait in line and get sandwiches made to order.  Great that we went there instead of Pizza. Discovering this gem was like unearthing culinary treasure; it's unequivocally the best spot for subs I've ever had the pleasure of dining at. Their Italian Steak Tip and classic Italian subs are masterpieces, rivaling even the authentic sandwiches you'd find in the heart of Italy, but with a unique twist that elevates them above and beyond. The dedication to freshness and quality is evident in every bite, from the crisp vegetables to the savory meats, and the generous portions ensure you're more than satisfied. There's something about the way they balance flavors and textures that showcases their unparalleled craftsmanship in sandwich-making. It's my all-time favorite place to eat, and each visit reaffirms my love for their exceptional subs, making every meal a memorable experience. Plain and simple, the best market in the North End. They have the best imported Italian products, the subs are on another level & they sell beer/wine. My favorite place to pop in and see what new items they have and also grab a can\u2019t miss Italian sub(best in city)\n\nAlso, I love the Tukka, I love the turkey, I love the chicken parm subs..oh and since I usually go there hungry I tend to grab a quick square pizza slice at the register. You can\u2019t beat this place. We really enjoyed this place. The seating was super cramped but the atmosphere was still really nice. The food was great.  We loved the host. She was grumpy and funny and we enjoyed her the most. We didn't have a reservation and she was able to get us in quickly.  I had the lasagna and my boyfriend had the chicken parm. We would go again. We came here for dinner and were impressed by the delicious food and warm atmosphere! The Caesar salad for two was the perfect start to the meal. Simple, but so well done! For my main course, I had the linguini and mussels and it was amazing! The the mussels were fresh and tender. Service was excellent, with friendly and attentive staff who made the experience even better. If you\u2019re looking for authentic Italian food in the North End, L\u2019Osteria is a must-visit. I have to be honest, everyone, I mean everyone was talking about this spot. It's nice and the service was good, but... it was cold AF. Teeth chattering \"keep your jacket on the whole time\" cold.\n\n-chicken parm 7/10 (sauce resembled tomoto soup more than marinara)\n\n-Stuffed mushrooms 0/10\nthe mushrooms had no flavor and were stufed with pure breadcrumbs. no exaduration. just powder.\n\nThey were very nice though. I gave 4 stars instead of 3 cause the try hard.\n\nBut i have to keep it real for my viewers Wife wanted pasta so we were able to just pop in here.\nI was honestly hoping for a bit better tasting food. Pasta fagioli was watery as was my chicken franchise. Wife has pasta bolognese and it too seemed watery. Maybe that\u2019s their style. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f While visiting Boston on a girls weekend with my teenage daughter, we wanted to be sure to hit the North End. Restaurant came on a recommendation from a close friend, and did not disappoint.\n\nWe ordered the calamari and artichokes, both delicious. A couple of lovely young ladies came out and sang in Italian while we had our appetizers; they were both incredibly talented.\n\nMy daughter ordered the shrimp Alfredo and I had the lobster ravioli. They were beyond delicious! Great portion sizes and everything arrived at the table with the appropriate amount of time between courses. For an extremely busy Saturday evening, we did not feel rushed at all. Highly recommend for any occasion. Yvonne\u2019s is a trendy, popular establishment. It\u2019s tucked away but well known. Always busy and recommend making a reservation. Bar seats are first come, first serve but fill up fast. Cocktails are top notch. Gin and tonic is one of the best. Food is tasty and shareable. Pricey but a fantastic experience when you\u2019re looking for one. This place gets a solid four stars from me! The food and drinks were absolutely delicious, hitting the spot perfectly. Our server was friendly and attentive, making the experience even better.  I also loved the decorations, they really added to the overall ambiance.\nThe only downside was the wait time. Even though we made a reservation, we still had to wait 40 minutes for our table. It was a bit frustrating, but thankfully they let us hang out in the bar area while we waited. The bar, and the whole area in general, had a really nice vibe.\nDespite the wait, the delicious food, friendly service, and great atmosphere definitely made up for it. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal with a lively atmosphere. This has to be one of the best restaurant I have ever been to in my life. Great price for the interior/ambiance. The service, and food quality are stellar. I feel it is slightly pricier than it should be for the portion you get (it's more like Manhattan pricing for the size) but regardless, I can see why this place has amazing reviews. Everything about the dining experience was GREAT. The front staff and everyone were all so great to talk to and kind. Such a welcoming vibe and the food was so so good. 1000% recommend! We had researched a few places to go and eat. While in the elevator, a guy recommended Yvonne\u2018s, which was literally around the corner from the hotel we were staying at this was right up our alley. Food was absolutely perfect. Every dish we had was perfect. Service was prompt and atmosphere was just what we were looking for dark Moody, sexy and clean. Octopus,  lobster,  pizza , steak tartare and dessert (with dessert wine ) were all spot on dishes. We expected the bill to be double what it was. Always judge a place by the bathrooms as well. These were beautiful and clean. Highly recommend. Will be back next time in Boston. We never go out on valentine\u2019s Day. This was two days before and was perfect. Thank you. Yvonne\u2019s is a pretty unique establishment and I can say I\u2019ve never been to any place quite like it.  You enter through an unassuming barber shop entrance in an alley and the place opens up into a dimly lit, glamorous and opulent space outfitted with mahogany woodwork, crystal chandeliers, silk brocade and plush velveteen upholstery.  This place definitely has cool vibes and atmosphere in spades.\n\nWe went there for drinks and appetizer before dinner, and found seating at the bar right away.  The bartender was great.  After listening to our preferences, he recommended some drinks that hit all the right notes with us.  Upon his suggestion, we tried the Thai Octopus and it was perfectly cooked and delicious.  We will definitely return for dinner next time we\u2019re in Boston. Nice and quiet coffee spot with a cozy and peaceful vibe. We had a matcha fog, raspberry danish, and an americano, all of which were great. Their lavender tea is also really good. The staff were kind and friendly. This is probably the only coffee shop left from the days of Harvard square coffee glory, when we had Crema Cafe, when Starbucks Reserve was a thing... Yes, Dunkin is still around, but you won't find another coffee shop here that has been delivering such a coffee quality and atmosphere. And if I missed something, point it out in a comment! I hope they are not squeezed out as other good coffee shops. Stop by and support them by buying a cup of the best brew in the square! Peet's Coffee consistently delivers an excellent coffee experience with rich, flavorful brews that satisfy every palate. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, perfect for relaxing or getting work done. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, ensuring a pleasant visit every time. Whether you're grabbing a quick cup or enjoying a leisurely coffee break, Peet's never disappoints. Great coffee and drink options. The horchata iced oat milk latte is delicious! Highly recommend\n\nNice little park out front with live music sometimes. Great coffee and location, nice staff. A bit too few comfortable seats, and just one restroom, but otherwise really great, especially when outside seating is available. This is hands down one of the healthiest and most affordable spots I\u2019ve come across in a long time. The best part? Most of the menu is $10 or under\u2014a pleasantly shocking surprise!\n\nThey serve super fresh juices, bowls, and smoothies that taste amazing. The servers and staff are great too, making the experience even better.\n\nDon\u2019t expect much in terms of atmosphere\u2014this is more of a grab-and-go kind of place.\n\nBut if you\u2019re after fresh, healthy eats that won\u2019t break the bank, this is it! Great selection of smoothies, specialty smoothies as well. They have organic juices, wellness shots add in they sell toast with toppings. They have awesome A\u00e7a\u00ed bowls and other bowls as well. It is a great place for a cold brew. They have New Orleans style Colter coffee there smoothies are delicious and not overly price. The drinks are not sweet at all. The natural sweetness even in the fruit doesn't come out. If you get two largest you want, it's going to be a $20. I don't think it's worth it. You better off. Going to the one next door is 599 and it has way more flavor I was honestly shocked when I was handed this avocado toast. When the only ingredients are avocado and bread, a ripe avocado is the minimum requirement. This avocado was SO HARD. The employee behind the counter spent a good 5 minutes hacking at the avocado with a fork trying to get it to soften. This effort made a huge mess and the entire outside of the box was smeared in avocado. The bread, which could\u2019ve been an edible part of this meal, was soggy and smushed.\n\nThis toast tasted even more unappetizing than it looks, if you\u2019ve ever tried to eat a hard flavorless avocado you would know. I would so much rather been told the avocados weren\u2019t ripe instead of paying $7.50 for truthfully the worst avocado toast ever. Best A\u00e7a\u00ed Bowls I\u2019ve ever experienced. Very large bowls with amazing fresh fruit and wonderful granola. I\u2019ve tried a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls in many different locations, and these are the best. Highly recommend. Area 51 bowl is perfect. This is hands down one of the healthiest and most affordable spots I\u2019ve come across in a long time. The best part? Most of the menu is $10 or under\u2014a pleasantly shocking surprise!\n\nThey serve super fresh juices, bowls, and smoothies that taste amazing. The servers and staff are great too, making the experience even better.\n\nDon\u2019t expect much in terms of atmosphere\u2014this is more of a grab-and-go kind of place.\n\nBut if you\u2019re after fresh, healthy eats that won\u2019t break the bank, this is it! Great selection of smoothies, specialty smoothies as well. They have organic juices, wellness shots add in they sell toast with toppings. They have awesome A\u00e7a\u00ed bowls and other bowls as well. It is a great place for a cold brew. They have New Orleans style Colter coffee there smoothies are delicious and not overly price. The drinks are not sweet at all. The natural sweetness even in the fruit doesn't come out. If you get two largest you want, it's going to be a $20. I don't think it's worth it. You better off. Going to the one next door is 599 and it has way more flavor I was honestly shocked when I was handed this avocado toast. When the only ingredients are avocado and bread, a ripe avocado is the minimum requirement. This avocado was SO HARD. The employee behind the counter spent a good 5 minutes hacking at the avocado with a fork trying to get it to soften. This effort made a huge mess and the entire outside of the box was smeared in avocado. The bread, which could\u2019ve been an edible part of this meal, was soggy and smushed.\n\nThis toast tasted even more unappetizing than it looks, if you\u2019ve ever tried to eat a hard flavorless avocado you would know. I would so much rather been told the avocados weren\u2019t ripe instead of paying $7.50 for truthfully the worst avocado toast ever. Best A\u00e7a\u00ed Bowls I\u2019ve ever experienced. Very large bowls with amazing fresh fruit and wonderful granola. I\u2019ve tried a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls in many different locations, and these are the best. Highly recommend. Area 51 bowl is perfect."

    "reviews": "Loooooved our experience! Our tour guides were very fun and knowledgable. The tour was about 2 and a half hours. It was a bit rocky at first but it went smoothly once our of the bay area. We managed to see some whales wich was amazing! Highly recommend My family and I had an amazing time at the end of September 2024 on the whale watching tour. The weather was great and we were able to see so much wild life. We encountered a sun fish, 2 hump back whales, and a couple of sharks. My boys, under 10 years old, didn't want the tour to end! We would definitely go again. We loved our harbor cruise. Lots of history to learn about the harbor and the land around it. Our guide was great, funny, and knowledgeable. I can't remember his real name, but he said if we didn't like the tour then his name was Roberta ha. Unfortunately, I only remember that name... But our tour was great! Went on the whale watching tour and had a blast. It\u2019s about 1.5 hr to get to where the whales are, roughly 30 min to view and 1.5hr to get back.\n\nRecommend bringing whatever motion sickness medication you may need (there\u2019s none for purchase on the boat), snacks or drinks. Snacks and drinks are available for purchase, but the line backs up quickly and is pretty long throughout your entire time on board.\n\nBoat, bathrooms, seating areas were clean and the staff was VERY thoughtful and attentive. All around a great experience. So gorgeous and fun. Go up to the top deck for best views. Kevin was a great tour guide/narrator. Loooooved our experience!

All around a great experience. So gorgeous and fun. Go up to the top deck for best views. Kevin was a great tour guide/narrator. My 2 star rating is based on value of the experience. It shouldn't reflect on the driver or guide. The driver and guide were nice and friendly and the guide did her best to make it a fun trip  There are better ways to spend $50/person. We did this experience on a sunny, cool day in November. Our duck left its plastic windows down, probably because of the wind, but I noticed some others that left their windows rolled up (and would have been nicer to see and take pictures). It was an ok experience for me, not spectacular. It's not a \"must do\" activity.. Personally, I would have rather ridden a trolley that I could hop on and off at my leisure or done The View.\n\nUpdate: As we did more sightseeing I found myself referring to information our guide shared. I changed my review from 2 stars to 4. Better than I initially thought. Worth doing at least once. Had a really fun time on the Duck Tour. The guide was great telling us a bunch of facts about the city and kept us entertained with some humor along the way. Honestly had a better time with the driving portion than the time on the water. But the water was fun too. Several people got to drive the boat. Only thing making this 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. Little more than I wanted to spend but everything is expensive these days so I get it. I would recommend if you want a break from walking around the city and want to sit for a while and enjoy the sights. The weather was awful, cold, wind and rain. But we had an amazing tour guide who saved our day. Her name was Paprika and she was so much fun. We enjoyed the drive around Boston and river sailing. I would bring more of my friends and guests to this tour. Growing up in the Boston area, I never really considered doing one of the quacky tours but coming back to visit with my young kids and looking for an adventure before our appointment we figured\u2026why not\u2026 just amazing! First, our Duckrator Ripple Stillwater was an absolute gem, his jokes were really funny and the knowledge of Boston was impressive. I knew some things, but I learned a lot more\u2026 then the Duck we were on was the coolest ride in town\u2026 let\u2019s drive on the street and then go for a boat ride without getting out of the vehicle!! That\u2019s cool. Veteran supported, history made and fun times had by all including being on the Charles river and seeing things never seen before. Recommended highly by a former Bostonian and would do it again!! Boston Duck Tour is an entertaining experience both for adults and children to enjoy and learn the history of the Boston / US Revolution. The duck travels on road as well as Charles River waters, while professional guide narrate valuable history tales when passing the iconic buildings or places.Kids enjoy the scenes around on surface or water.This also gives opportunity to see the Cambridge buildings, including MIT/ Harvard Business School, apart from Boston University on Boston side. We visited in October 2020  with family and enjoyed. Ground staff needs training, and their contact  telephone needs to be attentive all the time. For events big or small, I believe Meritage can easily handle them all. This elegant dining establishment situated right on the water features wonderful views of the harbor, spectacular service, and amazing menu selection. I came here for NYE, and had all my expectations met, with some even being exceeded! Course timing was perfect, and the ambiance was both intimate and welcoming. Those who are searching for a taste of the best of Boston need not look any further.\n\nIf this was helpful, please consider a thumbs up. It would be greatly-appreciated! An excellent and surprisingly affordable (compared to its peers) fine dining experience.  The views of Boston Harbor and the airplanes taking off and landing at Logan are a lovely bonus.  While they take their wines extremely seriously (the wine list has many bottles priced in the hundreds and even thousands of dollars), you can get a very enjoyable three-glass flight to go with your meal for about $25.  Service is on par with the best fine dining available in Boston.  Plating is amazingly playful, with (spoiler alert) dry ice coming with the scallops and the mushroom dish served on a beautiful wooden platter.  All told, you can get out of there for $80 per person with wine, so quite reasonable for what you're getting.  Highly recommended! I recently went to Meritage with my wife for dinner on her birthday. It was an amazing experience and my wife has been on cloud-9 since. This is less a dinner out and more a dining experience. The staff are all top tier professional and offered a complimentary champagne and wrote a nice happy birthday note on the desert dish for the special occasion. My wife had an amazing view of the harbor which she loved as well.\n\nI saw some other reviews comment on the food quality. I can kind of understand as they don't season the way I think a lot of people anticipate. Everything is more about complimentary flavors and emphasizing the ingredients over adding gratuitous flavoring. If you like heavily salted or sugary food you might not be a fan. I found everything amazing though. Perfectly cooked and in unique combinations but not gimmicky. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and happy to entertain all our questions. They kept us updated on kitchen times and promptly removed used dishes. The small dishes offer a nice sample while the large dishes left both my wife and I satiated. We both felt well attended to without being badgered.\n\nWhile the prices are a high they are not unreasonable.  I found myself almost considering it a bargain at the end of the night for the experience we had. If you're more price conscious like myself you might not find yourself here regularly but I highly recommend it for a special occasion and look forward to returning in the future. The service was great. The drinks were fantastic. The food was expertly prepared. Easily the best meal I had in Boston recently. I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I can't because of the atmosphere. I have had a number of meals rivaling the one I had at Meritage, but those places didn't feel stuffy. Those places had extensive wine menus and sommeliers as well. They just didn't have the vibe. If you want to feel elegant then this will be your place, but if you just want a really good meal then this might feel like too much for you. It really is a nice restaurant. It's just not my kind of place. Went with friends and did the 5 course menu with wine pairing (several chef extras at no charge). Excellent food, wine and service, with relaxing atmosphere and harbor view. Would definitely go back again for a special celebration. There are few restaurants that can match this place for quality, attention to detail and selection. The dishes were superb snd the wine selection perfect. My highest recommendation. Great service! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and we had some great banter over food and preparations. He had nice recommendations when it came time to pick out our menu selections. That would be my advice, the menu is huge... Let them help guide you. We were not disappointed and even tried some new things. The stuffies were awesome and the tuna had the perfect texture. So many flavors it was a fantastic meal with a lot of great energy in the dining room. Not to mention the wonderful views at this Harborside location. The Boston cream pie is not traditional but it's still very good! I was traveling on a business trip from India in January, and as a seafood lover, how could I have missed dining at Legal Sea Foods? The food and atmosphere were amazing. I'd like to give a BIG shout-out to Megan, who was absolutely fabulous in suggesting some of the best dishes on the menu. She was incredibly helpful. Loved the food ! My family came from out of town to celebrate my sister's birthday and we had an amazing experience! We came as a group of eight with a reservation for a Saturday lunch and were seated in the corner with a great view of the water. The atmosphere was lively but not too loud.\n\nOur server Bailey was excellent - she was patient, friendly, and accommodated all of our requests including taking group photos and helping us with the birthday cake.\n\nThere was a promotion going on for $1 cups of clam chowder with an order of an entree, so for appetizers most of us got clam chowder and we also split some oysters and calamari. I ordered the fish sandwich, which I could barely finish because I was so full from the appetizers. I appreciate that all our entrees were brought out at the same time.\n\nWe came to Legal Sea Foods as a family countless times growing up, so I'm really pleased we had another good experience. It's not cheap, but I appreciate that everything tasted fresh and I'm happy to support a local chain. The wife and I tried this restaurant while visiting Boston. We started with the clam chowder. It was perfect on a cold evening. I had the fried shrimp with Cajun seasoning, french fries, and coleslaw. My wife had the grilled salmon, whipped potatoes, and brussel sprouts with bacon. Both were delicious. The waitress was friendly and attentive. We were seated near the window with a view of the harbor. If I ever visit Boston again, it will be mandatory for me to stop by Legal Sea Foods. I booked the trip before looking at the weather forecast so unfortunately the light drizzle and wet cold prevented outdoor patio seating to enjoy the harbor views. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve spent a lot more money at other seafood restaurants in my life but the food here was very approachable and delicious, top-tier. Got the staples like clam chowder, lobster roll with butter, and a half-dozen of assorted oysters. For $45 bucks I got a huge lobster roll with a generous amount of lobster but man! I\u2019m not gonna even lie, I loved the oysters too. I\u2019m a purist, and those oysters sitting in its own oceanic liquor were enough on their own but a tiny sprinkle of mignonette is okay \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc. It\u2019s no wonder they have so many locations and long-time relationships with the local professional sport teams. Solid choice for last minute dinner on the water.  Nothing fancy but Grilled chicken breast dinner is a healthy and hearty portion.  Super basic food, but right on the water in the center of the action.  Great outdoor patio and attentive service. Wrapping up a hot day with a fantastic meal at Tia's Seafood Restaurant in Boston was the perfect way to end our adventure on the Freedom Trail. After a day of exploring history, our group was famished and craving some fresh seafood. Tia's did not disappoint.\n\nThe ambiance at Tia's was casual yet classy, with a lively atmosphere that welcomed both locals and tourists. We started with a round of their famous clam chowder, which was creamy and filled with tender clams. The main courses were a seafood lover's dream: succulent lobster rolls, perfectly grilled scallops, and crispy fish and chips. Each bite was a reminder of why Boston is known for its seafood.\n\nService at Tia's was top-notch, with friendly staff who made us feel right at home. We enjoyed our meal with a view of the waterfront, and the gentle evening breeze was the cherry on top. If you find yourself in Boston, Tia's Seafood Restaurant is a must-visit, especially after a day on the Freedom Trail. It's the ideal spot to relax, savor delicious seafood, and soak in the Boston vibes. Tia is laid back restaruant with calm atmosphere on the waterfront. The food was really good. The chicken barbecue flatbread was delicious.  The flatbread was chicken, barbecue sauce, cheese, and onion. It was great bite. The regular fries were yummy fried goodness with perfect amount of salt.  My co workers loved the truffle fries too.  The service was overall really good. The only downside was the bathrooms werent clean enough. They were filfthy. Tia's Waterfront Restaurant in Boston offers a mixed experience. Located in a highly touristic area, its prices are fair considering the prime location. However, the service leaves much to be desired. Our waitress took an unusually long time to bring us even a single drink and a beer. To make matters worse, the restrooms were quite dirty, which detracted from the overall dining experience. While the food and location might attract visitors, the service and cleanliness need significant improvement. Made a reservation and arrived early. Was able to be seated quickly. Friendly staff great food! We ordered the buffalo chicken mac and cheese, clam chowda, fish & chips. Everything was great! Snack Bar was closed on this date: 22Dec. Have had their chili dog before and was looking forward to it, but apparently closed for winter Perfect if you want to waste your money for a taco that falls literally apart. Nothing special about this place Good food I was not looking for dinner \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f but I was becoming hungry. I walked past the window \ud83e\ude9f seats of this restaurant and the food looked good! After walking Newbury Street, I decided to try here. Expecting a window seat \ud83e\ude91, which to me is great \ud83d\udc4d, I was taken downstairs to a comfortable booth to my surprise \ud83e\udee2.\nI had multiple servers and all of them were great! I had the Chicken Piccata with complimentary fresh bread \ud83c\udf5e and butter. Yummy \ud83d\ude0b!\nClassic rock \ud83e\udea8 played at a quiet level \ud83c\udf9a\ufe0f. The overhead lights dimmed a bit as the sun \u2600\ufe0f set.  The bathroom was in good shape. I used to run janitorial crews so I cannot help but notice.\nI had a better time than I expected! Prices are typical of running a business in Boston. You are a \ud83e\udea8 stones, not Rolling, throw from the Commonwealth Avenue Mall if you want to walk off a few calories.\nI recommend a visit! From the girls that seated me to my waitress Anna was top notch. If you wanna eat good n feel good come here. I don\u2019t have 215k views for nothing. Amazing place amazing people amazing food. Joe\u2019s actually really surprised me. My sister and I kicked it off with a round of espresso martinis which were great. My brother got coffee which they pour straight from a nice little pot.\n\nI got the classic American breakfast which was delicious. The sausages were flavorful and the potatoes were perfectly cooked + seasoned. The eggs were very basic but that seems to be the norm at breakfast places these days. I stole bacon from my dad and it was great as well. Lastly, they have a gluten free toast option which was way better than I expected. Reservations for dinner on a weekend trip to Cambridge. Busy place! Service was okay. Thankfully the chef took my wife's food allergy seriously because it felt like the server blew it off but then she was back after the chef had more questions. Food was very good. Instead of dinner we got a bunch of apps and sides. Starter bread was fantastic. Place was pretty cool, only wish it was less family friendly because some parents were not controlling their children. Very good bourbon sour. Me, my husband and friend ate here for the first time, made a reservation the night of and had no problem getting in. All the food was really good. I had the cheeseburger egg rolls, meatloaf and my husband got a burger. My friend hot the chicken pot pie. Overall it was a good priced menu with good options to choose from. A trip to Boston is incomplete without a trip to Sail Loft. From clam chowda to fish n chips to calamari to warm lobster roll, everything was top notch n fresh. The staff is very friendly and had a good chat with the manager/owner. If U r in Boston, def go here for some incredible sea food. It\u2019s right next to the water and Quincy market so if it\u2019s a tourist spot, this food is more than authentic.\n\nHead here tomorrow, don\u2019t think anymore and enjoy the best seafood u ll ever taste. 5/5 all around. \ud83d\udc1f \ud83e\udd90 \ud83e\udd9e \ud83c\udf72 The lobster bisque is amazing! It\u2019s super rich and flavorful. The lobster roll is also great. However, the fish and chips need some more flavors to it. Overall, worth the wait!! Absolutely worth the wait! We came for dinner on a Friday around 7 and had about a 40-minute wait. Service was so fast once we were seated! 100% recommend the clam chowder (the dill is such a nice touch!) and lobster roll, which they offer hot with butter or cold with mayo. Amazing fries too! Chowder, chowder, chowder!!!  We ate here 3x in the week we were in Boston . Everything was good. I had the chowder twice, including a takeout .  The Calamari Balsamic salad for lunch was great. The breaded calamari was almost melt in your mouth . It was a generous mound on top of the lettuce . Their scrod was cooked perfectly . I did not have to wait for a table after 1 pm for lunch but  be prepared to wait about 25 minutes for a table , even before  6 pm. They do not take reservations. A trip to Boston wouldn\u2019t be complete without a trip here! Their chowder is amazing and I don\u2019t normally like clam chowder. The lobster roll is so delicious and filled with so much lobster you can\u2019t even see the roll. Served either hot or cold and you should try one of each. The French fries and fish and chips are so good and I had the special corned beef and cabbage and it did not disappoint. The place is always busy so put your name on the waiting list and be prepared for at least a half an hour wait. Our server was Will and he truly made our meal amazing. He is kind and understanding and really made us feel welcome! Came here for lunch before heading to the old state house and other sights. It was packed and we were lucky to get seated immediately. It has a full service bar in case you want a drink with your meal. We had the burger, spicy chicken sandwich and the avocado toast all of which were great. The location and ambience were wonderful Great place for dinner near our hotel in the North End. The menu had enough variety to satisfy everyone. My salmon was cooked to perfection. Friendly service and food came out quickly. Service was a bit slow to get started, but we were well taken care of afterwards. Burger looked amazing, lobster roll was ok, looked great just missing something. Grilled squash was very good. Nice fries. Overall atmosphere is very nice. Wednesday evening walked in and was seated right away. Drink orders came quick as well as the delicious korean wings.\n\nOrdered lobster roll and fish & chips. Entrees were pretty good, nothing special however the batter on the fish was very nice and crispy. Soggy batter is always a let down but these fillets held up very nicely.\n\nWould recommend and will be back Had Sunday Brunch here - place was very busy so we sat at the bar which was still exceptional service. The brunch menu here was the best out of all the brunch menus in the area - it actually had a great mix of both breakfast and lunch options ! We had the omelet - which was exceptional. So fluffy and light yet the inside was packed with great quality cheese and perfectly saut\u00e9ed onions/peppers. The potatoes were perfectly crispy without being oily. This will be our new brunch spot when we stay in town ! The views of the water are beautiful and no issues with the staff\nA bottle of water is $6 and a can of water is $4.\nThe food was edible, my group enjoyed the sandwich, but not the cold pizza DO NOT GO THERE! We went there event if the reviews were bad because we were on a rush to catch our Harbour Cruise. Everything is bad. Staff is rude, table and chairs are dirty, food is expensive for what you have, taste not great. For example, two chicken filets and a very few fries, 11$. Ham sandwich, well, just look at the picture.  Simply pathetic. We still can sit and buying drink from vendor machines when the cafe near closed Food was poor quality, expensive, and seating area was not well maintained for cleanliness. Avoid the cafeteria if you visit the aquarium. We came here right when it opened. There was no one else in the cafe, but we still couldn\u2019t find a clean place to sit. Nearly every table was dirty. Great ice cream! Try the large cone\u2014the small one is not enough. I asked for a worker name and his name was AZAM? He was so kind and helpful. I really appreciate people who love their job. Overall definitely going to come back because of this service. I got the vegan cookie dough icecream! Sooo yummm! Tried a cookie cookie shake \ud83c\udf6a\ud83e\udd5b Did not disappoint! Very smooth, and creamy but not too sweet! Love some Ben and Jerry's ice cream! My recent visit to Ben & Jerry's in Boston Seaport was decent. I ordered their strawberry milkshake and a chocolate sundae. The taste of both items was consistent with expectations.\n\nThe quality of the ice cream at this Ben & Jerry's location was good. What truly stood out, though, was the mediocre service. The staff members were unfriendly and it really negatively affected the experience.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this Ben & Jerry's location continues to decline based on the bad customer service. Other shops are opening up all around seaport and are much busier. Well if you expect them to actually be open till 11 like it is supposed to just don\u2019t. We walked there at 10:45 on a Friday night and the place was closed.  If you are to close at whatever time you want just update your hours to that. Worst sub I\u2019ve had here in over 15 years going there. Doesn\u2019t resemble itself at all from those days. Woman stocking shelves came over to make sandwich. Washed her hands for like 5 seconds and proceeds to put gloves on with wet hands. Bread was stale, hardly any meat. Never going back. Grossed out. SO after a negative interaction next door, I needed some junk food to stress eat, but in small quantity, like the mature adult I am. I got a small snack bag of potato chips. It was pricey to me at $1.99, but we are Downtown, so it is to be expected. When I got back and ate them, they were a little stale.\n\nThis store has a decent selection,  and sweets and treats, but mainly an abundance of liquor. Make sure to check your expiration dates. Staff was pleasant and helpful.\n\nVerdict: GOOD. I love going to the deli every week to get my turkey sandwich! The gentleman at the deli who always wears a baseball cap is extremely nice (he knows my order at this point\u2026 Cajun Turkey) the workers are always so friendly and it\u2019s my favorite and most affordable place to get a great sub! They also sell a large assortment of mainly domestic beers and wines as well as a huge convenience store with plenty of snack options! Yummy- I have missed the sandwiches and say I left Brockton. Get a sandwich and then go sit in the Common and soak up Boston's 2 months of summer. Sandwiches are solid, they're aren't \"the best\", it's a sandwich. Friendly service. Not a bad Starbucks per se, but there are so many local cafes and great small businesses nearby where you can get a better coffee. after buying a water bottle and drinking it in the store, I noticed a receptacle on top of the recycling bin as I was leaving the store and tossing out my empty water bottle. I moved the receptacle to put my empty water bottle in the recycling bin, and after I had thrown the bottle in the recycling, I was stopped by an employee saying to not use the recycling bin because the bin must be emptied by the staff. The staff member was genuinely upset I had used the recycling basket because she had to empty it later on, so she covered it with a receptacle so nobody would use it and then accosted me for moving said receptacle. Zero stars rude manager, unhygienic place, and bad coffee. There is an alternate Starbucks location just  five minutes from here would prefer that. Will get your order wrong every time. If you nicely ask them to remake it they will be extremely rude. Don't bother going here, they have a rude and disrespectful employee (she was a tall, curly-haired, cocky woman) The WORST SERVIC EVER IN AN starbucks! The manager is a rude person, we came from Miami and Canada Visiting Boston and this girl treat very bad and offensive to my mom a senior woman\u2026 i\u2019ll make a demand against to her! It seemed hectic in there but I could tell the team was holding it together and that\u2019s what I love to see! Plus the lady I dealt with Liz was so helpful and patient. I had someone with me who had never been to Starbucks and she was so awesome with being able to explain things and help us order correctly.  Easily 5/5 stars. Stepping into this Starbucks felt like traveling back in time, with its warm wooden interiors, antique decor, and cozy ambiance. The soft lighting and rustic details made it the perfect place to unwind with a rich, aromatic coffee. Whether you\u2019re looking for a quiet escape or a stylish spot to enjoy your brew, this caf\u00e9 delivers a truly nostalgic and inviting experience. Liz provided an exceptional experience during our visit to Starbucks in Boston! Despite coming all the way from Miami and Canada, Liz made a lasting impression with her professionalism and dedication. She handled a challenging situation with grace, ensuring everyone felt valued and respected. Her ability to manage interactions effectively, even under pressure, truly stood out. Thank you, Liz, for making our visit memorable\u2014you\u2019re a fantastic representative of the Starbucks team! I was in town for the Celtics game today and decided to stop by for my usual, a venti salted cream cold brew and a cheese danish. Despite how busy it was with so many customers, the team and supervisor managed everything impressively. They kept things running smoothly and provided excellent service. Thank you, Starbucks, for creating such a great experience for an out of town visitor. I highly recommend this location and its awesome team! The WORST SERVIC EVER IN AN starbucks!

They are fast, rarely a line, they will call you personally to tell you your medicine is in.\n\nThey have no issues transferring locations, they take the initiative to remind  you in advance your prescription is close to the expiration date, and they will contact the doctor for you.   This place serves you like you are their only customer. This is one of the BEST Rite Aid's ive been to. The pharmacy staff is so helpful and when my item is not in stock they order and get it to me in a timely manner. thank you guys! I always find what I need and the staff are always available to help Really like the manager, Josephine. If you like good (outstanding) wines and are close to Faneuil Hall, be sure to visit this wine store. Excellent service and an underground cellar that will surprise you. They\u2019re true treasures, especially French and Italian wines. For wine lovers, spend some time down there, you\u2019ll be surprised. It was worth the splurge! Easily overlooked and seems smaller than it is - be sure to check out the huge basement. Very knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend! This shop is a cool little place with a literal wine cellar down a narrow spiral staircase. The staff was very kind and helpful, and they stock a fair amount of quality spirits and wines, with a small selection of beer. The only drawbacks are that the wine cellar section is hard to make sense of, being somewhat disorganized and dusty, and there are some bottles old enough that they aren't likely to be good anymore, so do pay careful attention to vintages.\nThe inside feels kind of like a secret treasure hunt, though, which is fun, and the selection is fairly broad, so you are highly likely find something worth taking home. Really nice of Peter to give us a tour and share some of his experiences. Highly recommend this store for wine and spirits. It was the only walkable liquor store by faneuil hall that wasn't just wine and sold Jack Daniels. The older man behind the counter has a kind face and gave wonderful customer service. The prices were very reasonable for Boston. Great grocery store in terms of variety, and staff will literally take costumers suggestions. The cashiers are very friendly and helpful with no doubt. If you need any help, ask for Amir and he would help you right away. Many products in this shop have no price clearly displayed. Just code bar (not really useful...). I bought some food (4$)... No price on the packet... Well.... Went later to the shop....and see the same packet to 2.15$.... Very surprising... I'll do not add more... Location is convenient but quality is poor. No prices clearly marked.  Also this place constantly and consistently freezer burns ice cream like they are trying to do it on purpose. Cheaper then the place across the street but they have no option of paying with card. Not even debit. Lots of dry goods and sundries. Good candy and ice cream selection. Also has milk, eggs, some other refridgerated and frozen food, premade sandwiches and some simple produce. Oh, and lots of wine. Nothing fancy or terribly fresh. Nice place overall, BUT the men's section was very limited due to construction and remodeling of the place. Loud noises because of the mentioned ongoing construction. There were really long lines at the cash register on a Tuesday morning. I waited over 20 minutes just to pay.\nNot a good customer experience!!! Great clothing im glad that i went into the store for my jeans , i know my size had changed and didnt want to go through the whole size exchange online n chose to just drive there to mall where they had both the adult Abercrombie and the kids stores - seperate stores on different ends of mall btw lol but umm yeah either way i was able to shop for school clothes for the girls and also find what size pants i fit into aswell as also what style best suits me at the moment and i am now very satisfied with my jeans and sweaters !!\nAlso very satisfied with the winter jackets i bought my daughters last year for their bdays in november that still fit this year and look as good as they did the day i bought them ! That is with a 6 and 8 yo children that play rough so that is nice that i am not having to turn around and buy them expensive jackets again this year ! Very happy with all of my purchases from this brand of clothing my youngest daughter is 6yo and wears a size 9/10 short in pants which is impossible to find at target or any of the other stores I\u2019ve tried- and my other daughter is a 9/10 either regular or long she has long legs and arms and so we have issues with long sleeves being long enough in torso and arm area as well as her pants being long enough in the leg area but not here so thank you for making clothing for children that actually fit perfectly to their bodies!! Not much much in stock and pretty unorganized, specially in the jeans area. The waiting time for the changing rooms was also insane, so keep that in mind. The multilevel aspect was also a bit annoying because you have to go up and down a ton to exchange sizes or to keep browsing. ordered online , paid extra 22$ shipping for next day delivery  and received no updates whatsoever. contacted customer service . they had no clue where my order was either! this is the worst store to shop online from. i am extremely dissapointed. The staff are amazing they work with you they explain everything you to know. They always ask if you have any rewards. Management excellent the associate\u2019s on the floor always happy welcoming you in with sincerity. I continue to shop there deals online with tat is xh Ghastly name for such captivating store. These folks make mind-bending hot sauce, bbq sauce, glazes, etc. ALL NATURAL. No weird preservatives. You can sample all of it. And yeah, they have a 9 MILLION Scoville scale (Carolina Reaper is around 1-2 million). Shane, 12 years a chef, rocks and knows their stuff. While in texas was looking to purchase hot sauce as a christmas gift And found pepper palace. So happy to have found pepper palace.So much options and dry rubs. Barbecue sauce pepper jelly, salsa , an of course , hot sauce. All made with natural ingredients\n\nWhile back in Boston I was Christmas shopping in Wrentham and found a pepper palace there so Delighted. And also found out they have locations in boston and natick as well.\n\nShane and James are great from boston store in Faneuil Hall. They helped me try Some samples and they also cook and knew food pretty good.\nSo it was great talk to them about the products. So if you're a foodie, or just like to cook and create. I highly recommend visiting pepper palace .\n\nThey also had deals that had me coming back where if you buy a certain amount you would get one free.\nI literally just finished making tacos with the world tour mexican taco seasoning and black bean corn salsa.\nI have made ribs with their apple cinnamon barbecue sauce with the apple dry rub.\n\nAlso the maple chipotle rub with the honey chipotle rum barbecue sauce. I made a cajun pasta with a big easy cajun seasoning alongside the Italian seasoning with parmesan in it.\n\nAnd plan on making a brisket rub with the Texas brisket Rub . Soup with the garlic herb seasoning and some more ribs with the all american rub. And not to forget the free hot sauce.I got which was good and a curry hot sauce that I purchase which is phenomenal I'm from Texas--and this was a whole lot of awesome hot sauce, spices, dry rubs, candy, glazes--you name it they had it. James was incredibly knowledgeable, and did a little mixology, literally making blueberry pancakes flavor from pepper glazes. Absolutely outstanding. Goes from mild products to a hot sauce called The End: Flatline, at nearly 8 million SKU! There's multiple locations, we went to the one near Faneuil Hall on market Street. Go see James and try some! SHANE!!!!!! This man is the BEST salesmen chef in the area. I was visiting from Georgia and decided to pop in and see what they had to offer. I started in the rubs section and was immediately overwhelmed. Shane came in with his cape and was able to give me a complete run down of what each item has to offer, what to use it on, and great combos in which to use the items. He was so knowledgeable of the products and about food in general. He was patient with me and walked me through all of the products in the store (rubs, BBQ sauce, hot sauce, etc.). I will be a repeat customer solely because of his customer service. HOTTEST SAUCE I CAN FIND FOR MY HOT SAUCE LOVER. I can never find a hot enough hot sauce for my fiance, I walked in and said \u201cI\u2019m looking for something you need a waiver to taste test\u201d the guy says he has one. I\u2019m thinking he joking but he wasn\u2019t. It was hottest stuff this guys ever had and he can\u2019t get enough of it (jokes 2 drops is good the tiny bottle will last while) hottest he\u2019s ever had. This is the place if you\u2019re looking for HOT Cute little souvenir shop in the Faneuil Hall Marketplace. In my opinion you have the best chance of finding a souvenir you like in this shop over the others scattered around the city or in the airport. They\u2019re a 2 floored souvenir store with a wide range of souvenirs and Knick Knacks. I really appreciated the large variety of merchandise at Best of Boston.  It's a 2-story shop located in the northern row of shops in Faneuil Hall.  They carry everything from college stuff, sports team stuff, food items, and even a large selection of plush toys.  As others have mentioned, prices are slightly higher than other cart vendors located within the main hall, but at least the credit card machine doesn't mysteriously \"break\" as you pull out your wallet.  I was able to easily pick up swags for all the people back home that represented Boston well.  The people working in the shop were quite friendly and helpful. Cute little shop. Just wish they had more options. Was looking forward to finding a couple of more souvenirs considering this store has two levels. The souvenirs sold could be a bit more pleasing to the eye. This place is so good, Manager is so good! There're a lot of goods! We bought a lot of souvenir at there. Just enjoy it! Nice little gift shop with a pretty good selection. I showed up at 6:45 pm to purchase something and was met with a locked door. They are typically opened until 8 pm daily. I asked the sales associate (through the glass door) why they were closed since even with holiday hours they are opened until 7 pm and I couldn\u2019t make out what she said since I can\u2019t heard through a glass. Regardless if they were closed at 7 pm why were the doors locked by 6:45 pm????? Don\u2019t waste your time go to another location they clearly makeup their own work hours. I love this location. Everytime I go I'm always greeted very friendly and always very quick to help. I believe the woman's name is Kirsten(sorry if I spell it wrong) she helps me everytime and is amazing! I'll be back as always, thanks again!\n-Amanda Great experience and very friendly lady who helped me. I always have a great  experience when I come to this store. The salespeople are very friendly and knowledgeable, and I love the candles! There are lots of other fun accessories and fragrance products as well. I used to not be able to go into the shop because of the way they smelled but this place was fine. Best selection of any that I have ever been. Staff was super nice and helpful. Lots of sales and special offers. Love the little section where you can smell different scents to figure out what type of candles you like best. Based on that I got some great recommendations from the staff. Keep in mind they usually give you coupons when you make a purchase for when you come back. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. I had an excellent experience at this phone repair shop! My phone wasn\u2019t charging properly, and the technician was super friendly and professional. He quickly assessed the issue, gave me a fair price, and even assured me there would be no charge if he couldn\u2019t fix it. Thankfully, he was able to fix the issue, and my phone is working great again! Highly recommend! I have brought my phone in here twice to get my back glass replaced (iPhone 12 pro) and each time has been amazing! Really good customer service, great communication. They\u2019ll do estimates for insurance if you need them. The gentlemen that repaired my phone went above and beyond to not only make it look like brand new again but to actually work like brand new again!!! They deserve more than 5 stars and i will be back with other devices. I took a smart tablet TV here and they looked at it within a half hour, identified the problem, and called me to ask if I was willing to order the part. They are very nice and communicated with me often over the phone. This was the second place I brought my device to. The first place dismissed me and told me it was broken without even looking at it. This place was willing to give me a little bit of time and saved me from having to buy a new one. Akash was very polite and informative. I paid a $30 diagnostic fee, and came back about 45 minutes later to find out my charging port was cleaned and working, at no extra cost. Highly recommend. I went to this seven eleven yesterday after a few months.  I thought I wouldn't come back since I was yelled at and harassed by a customer that appeared to have many problems. I wanted a diet soda from the fountain.  The diet coke was just water and I took a regular ginger ale.  There are diet sodas in bottles but their prices are higher and you get a smaller serving.  I went to the front register, and there was an unpleasant odor.  I asked the person if they would refill the diet coke (I had seen someone refilling it in the past) and he shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.  I was also overcharged for one item.  There is a Massachusetts law that a customer should get a full refund when overcharged.  I didn't mention this to the front worker as I thought he wouldn't do anything about it with his\" I don't care\" attitude. For all the customers who said they have had excellent experiences at this store, I am glad for them.  That has not been the case for me, I will never shop there again.  I realize that my not shopping there won't make a difference in total sales. There are other 7-11 stores that are better. Cashier was rude af, but the shop is always well stocked if you're willing to put up with micro aggressions, likely due to the amount of people begging at the door 24/7, no one wants to enter. This 7-11 is an experience unto itself that should absolutely not be missed. I stopped in on Christmas Eve to buy holiday scratch tickets and some MegaMillions ($1bn jackpot!). Every part of my experience exceeded expectations.\n\nA drunk woman about 20 years my senior was playing the numbers game like she was at Encore and had $65 in winnings after her several dozen tickets had been checked. While we waited she told the group of 3 uncomfortable tourists in front of me about her 103 grandchildren (that she knows of). Absolute perfection.\n\nThe tourists bought their Diet Sodas and scuttled away, and it was my turn to order. Unlike most lottery retailers the staff at 7-11 can't be bothered to organize and label their scratch tickets by cost, so I needed to ask if the giant baubled Xmas tree ticket was $10, after being confused by my question the clerk was able to confirm the price accurately for me.\n\nThere was a second round of confusion when I asked for 10 of them, but when he realized I wasn't joking and confimed it would cost $100, he expertly pulled the roll out of the dispenser, dropped one side of it to the floor and quickly counted out my tickets, then added my MegaMillions and completed the transaction without any fuss.\n\nI honestly can't understand the negative reviews of this location. It is well lit. The staff and other patrons are friendly and helpful. The stock is fresh and easily accessible and I felt totally safe and comfortable throughout my transaction. I will absolutely be patronizing this location again in the future. I\u2019m unsure what the last reviewer meant by this is one of the most realistic locations. Hi unfortunately I did not have a great experience. The store is supposed to open at 7 AM every day and around 7:08 PM I joined three other people who were waiting for it to open. I start at work at 7:30 AM and really wanted to get a five hour energy to help me get through the day. However, the only indication of the store operating was the loud classical music that was being played by speakers on the outside of the building that had been reinforced with security cages. The music is meant to frustrate homeless people who may try to loiter around the store. I am unsure how I feel about this, but I will say it is pretty irresponsible of them to not open on time on the first work day of 2022. Especially, being in downtown Boston they should realize the number of customers that they lose by being late. This place is not open 24/7.  I went to this location around 5am and there was a guy inside just sitting on the side claiming the cashier was downstairs occupied. First of all why do you have a random person supervising your store if they do not work there? I honestly don\u2019t know how this location is even open still. They need to stick to regular business hours.  Don\u2019t ever waste your time and come here after hours. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!!

Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. Those guys are amazing! Went above and beyond to help me, even customized a part that my car needed so I won't have to buy the whole part. Incredibly nice honest people and great prices. Thanks so much! Very happy customer! Having had many unsatisfying experiences with shady mechanics this shop is a breath of fresh air. The prices are what they are, but trust me, they are more than reasonable and you will not get gouged. From my experiences, I can say that they do awesome work and you'll never pay or get work done, that you don't need. I highly recommend them for anything, big or small, to do with your exhaust. I most recently\n(Jan 13th 2025) had some work done on my Honda Accord and I was out of there in less than an hour.\nCheck them out, you won't be disappointed. I bought A 2008 MKZ a year ago with 38,000 miles on it. The car looked inside and out. I felt lucky to have found it shortly there after I noticed that had some clean noises when going from park to drive and the engine at times would feel like I wanted to jump out of the hood. I was regretting my purchase shortly there after I damaged the undercarriage severely I had a mechanic to work on it, cost me an obscene Amount of money and no, the damage was repaired. It drove less good than it had before I damaged the undercarriage.\n\nWhen the mechanic told me he had welded something I figured I\u2019m bringing it to Paul to look at. They have my car for three hours today.\nand For the first time since I bought the car it actually drives like what I I thought I was getting when I bought it\n\nThe customer service couldn\u2019t be better but I knew that before I went in because I\u2019ve used them before what\u2019s truly amazing as I\u2019m excited about driving my car\n\nThanks\nMike McDonough Y\u2019all gotta get y\u2019all muffler deletes on Lou\u2019s made my car sound much better and got tons of compliments on it. They\u2019re do their service really fast and good price. Can\u2019t go wrong with going to Lou\u2019s Custom Exhaust for any muffler work. Straight forward, no upsell, first come first serve basis, fast service and very reasonable price. Great customer service very helpful. Help me find all my items very fast. Excellent service definitely earned the five stars. Store has a sign in the window, that they will be back in 30 minutes, yet I been here a lot long than that. I took a picture of the door about 2:26, I been here a lot longer than that! Might want to have a talk to your employees, I\u2019ll never make the trip to your store again I've never written a bad review before, but this time I was genuinely frustrated. I bought casein protein powder from this store, it was nearly expired, which was pretty disappointing, especially since it was quite pricey. I bought it on December 21, 2023, and then later realized it was expiring in 12/2023. Honestly, I don't think I'll be returning. 1st reduced hours and then sign on door stating will return on 30 minutes.  More like 50 min shorting my time to purchase.  Other customers were waiting as well. I see from previous reviews same experience and u haven\u2019t remedied the issue.   I as well am never returning. Reasonable prices and selection, great service... and nice occasional member benefits. But will you please adjust your online hours to match when you are open? That would be great He made a key in 30 secs and it\u2019s working well! Cheap and efficient! 100% recommended! The gentleman behind the counter hammered out 2 keys within 60 seconds.\n\nFaster than any of those keyme machines (that told me it'll take 3-4 days to ship me the keys because the machine couldn't do it onsite).\n\nKey Works charged 10 dollars for something keyme wanted 24 dollars for. Why would anyone use one of those machines when there's such great service nearby? Over a month now here.and still a beautiful place I'm still at awe about the view from here. Concierges  are just a friendly as can be .night concierge is  really nice always smiling.so I'm five stars happy If you need keys made in Boston, this is the guy!!  Got done with 2 keys in 60 seconds flat.  Reasonable price, half of Roche Bros and instantaneous!!  With assurance of rework if key does not work!\nHe is fabulous! Excellent fast service. Knowledgeable and skilled Rude employees!  It says they are open yet the door is locked and both employees can\u2019t even give me the time to come to the door and tell me what time they actually open. They just lost a sale. I purchased a Ray-Ban sunglasses from this store yesterday, only to discover scratches upon closer inspection at home. Disappointed, I returned today, hoping for a swift resolution. However, the staff informed me it was the last piece and directed me to another nearby store, assuring me they had the new stock available. Upon arrival, I found they didn't have the item in stock either. It's disappointing that the first store didn't verify stock before sending me elsewhere. After visiting three stores today , I had to return the sunglasses. The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced in a sunglass hut. They have very expensive glasses, with inept and rude customer service associates. I walked into the store, and only had the associates hang up their phone calls they were already on.  No one said hi to me, and the store can literally fit only 15 people Max capacity. They had all the Time in the World to converse with each other, while I walked around the store lost looking for a birthday present for my wife. Please avoid the store and only shop online if you are in Faneuil hall. Grossly disappointed at the customer service and they are rude and blatantly ignorant with attention to the customers. This isn't mcdonald's, it's sunglass hut!!! I have always shopped at the Sunglass hut in Faneuil Hall  and will never go anywhere else. The store mgr is the best and always seems to show me different styles and I always buy them. I am a proud owner of 38 pairs of sunglasses person, versace,ralph lauren and prada and aruban. Have come here multiple times in the middle of business hours (3:30 PM) only to see that the store is closed\u2026 Disaster!!! Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!!

Visited Lucy\u2019s League about a month ago when visiting back east. Purchased 6 Boston sports team shirts for my girlfriend. When I brought them home, I found out that I screwed up the sizing.  They let me mail the shirts back, replaced them with the proper sizes, and sent them back to the west coast for me.  A+ Lucy\u2019s League! Thank you VERY much! This is a typical Boston store in a touristy location but it really does the trick. Women's sports fashion that is actually cute for women tired of wearing men's jerseys or pink Tom Brady t-shirts. High prices but the quality is there. Tiny shop but typically have a nice selection that is updated fairly frequently Good for tourists! Makes sense because of the location. Very Cape Cod vibe. But hey if you need yoga pants in a pinch they got you covered! So overpriced. Everything in Faneuil hall is overpriced. This is a wonderful store. Probably more Pop Collectibles than I've seen in one place in many sizes. Shelves full of Trade Paperbacks and comic book collected editions, plus many new and recent issues. I was really hoping to find back issue boxes, but aside from back issues they have a good selection of recent titles, including limited edition variant covers. Also books and collectibles and TTRPG volumes. This shop looks small, then when you climb the steps, it has several rooms full of everything any pop culture lover could ask for. Fantastic selection, fantastic staff, fantastic environment Love this comic store! There are so many good vibes and awesome manga. It's really big and has lots of different genres. Anything from Chainsaw Man, One Piece, Deathnote, etc. Overall, lots of variety in genre. There's other stuff like figures, shirts, hats, and more. Just a great place to visit in Boston in general. Really fun store to explore with two levels worth of goodies to walk through. We looked at a lot of things but just came away with the Stardew Valley cook book. We were a little disappointed that there weren't more Pokemon plushies but I imagine the good ones get sold out pretty quickly! On Feb. 18th 2025 this store was having some kind of event on the second floor and the room was going to closed at 1pm. I started to walk into the room at about 12:20 and was then greeted by a very rude worker. She had no human decency and no respect for others. It is a shame that people like this work at such a great store location. Will not be back anytime soon. If you\u2019re a New England sports fan, I Love Boston Sports is a must-visit! The store is a haven for anyone who bleeds Boston sports. The variety of unique and creative prints is truly impressive, each one capturing the spirit and history of the teams we love.\n\nWe were lucky enough to be assisted by Johnny, who made our experience even more memorable. He was incredibly personable and friendly, taking the time to walk us through the store and share the stories and meanings behind the prints. Johnny\u2019s passion for Boston sports is infectious, and it really enhanced our visit.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for something to commemorate a big win or just want to immerse yourself in New England sports culture, this is the place to go. We\u2019ll definitely be back, and we can\u2019t recommend it enough! One of the coolest stores I\u2019ve ever been too!!! Had more than just Boston sports stuff. I\u2019m from Buffalo and I bought a really cool Bills poster. Also bought an awesome Michael Jordan shirt! Will definitely check it out again next time I\u2019m in Boston! In a time when customer service has never been worse, I had a more than pleasant experience in working with this company - on something that I actually really messed up when ordering. I heard directly from the owner, who took my issue very seriously and addressed it himself - immediately. He genuinely cared that this was a gift  for my 11-year-old son, and reassured me that he would do whatever he could to help me make it up to him. It\u2019s clear that I Love Boston Sports truly values their customers. As long as they\u2019re around and selling their unique and cool stuff, I will be supporting this store as much as possible. Definitely worth a visit if you are a fan of any of the Boston sports teams. Was visiting Boston and wanted to get a Red Sox and Patriots shirt to wear to the games.\n\nStumbled upon I Love Boston Sports and was so impressed with the unique designs on their shirts. If you want a cool sports shirt that you can wear even if you\u2019re not a Boston sports fan, I highly recommend.\n\nAlready rocking my two new shirts back in Texas and everyone likes them! Plus their prices are very competitive and the shirts material is so comfortable.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the coolest sports shirts in town, check them out \ud83e\udd20 wish they had one in Texas!

I'm So In Love With This PLACE!!!!!! It's a Beautiful Little Ladies Shop With The Most Amazing Items :-) :-) :-) :-) :-). I Could Have Stayed There ALL DAY.  The Lady Behind The Counter Was So Pleasant and Nice :-) :-) :-) :-). I Just Can't Wait To Go Back. We love this place so much is like different world and the owner and Jesica ther are very helpful and friendly and ther mack me I fill my self confidence is stronger and any time we go ther we by so m as nt thinks than evry wher I go I am unforgettable with Maichel negrin look thank you love you so very much Intricate and beautiful jewelry from Israel. Don't bother if you're a POC! Nice selection I love urban outfitters! The clothes are great. I love the book selection! My daughter and I have so much fun here. I never realized that urban outfitters has in stock makeup, hairbrushes, perfumes, jewelry, records, and so much more. The men's section is just as full as the women's. Excellent selection and great sales. Prices and quality aside (tends to be hit or miss w/ UO), the staff were lovely at this location! Super friendly, and OMG the store was so organized! Even the sale section was relatively easy to browse. \u263a\ufe0f\n\n(I went to a different UO earlier in the day and ended up leaving because the disarray there overwhelmed me \ud83d\ude05) Customer service should be definitely worked on. The kinky haired man working was very helpful and had no problem helping me find clothes around the store and even took some of the clothes off the mannequin because they were out of stock. However, when I was changing in the fitting room, the associate with the green eyes didn't accommodate me at all. As I walked to the fitting room area, she did not even greet me or any of the customers behind me. She was on her phone and talking to someone in her headphones. I walked out and asked if she could get me these clothes items and she said that I had to go to the register and see if they had them. I almost felt the need to show her where exactly to find the items I wanted. I told her that I didn't want to leave my belongings there and she said she'd watch over them and then continued talking on the phone. It clearly wasn't busy. What was the point of her working in the fitting rooms if she didn't help at all ? Very disappointing experience. how did UO end up like this clothes are great but the worker there was very rude. when i went to the fitting room she kicked the door open and when i return the shirt she throw the hanger away infront of me. OMG!! i never saw any employee of any other clothing store that behave this way. i was shocked! she was this black curly teen girl. she absolutely need training!! or replace her with somebody else please with a better personality! They have some pretty remarkable glasswork and pewter; ended up buying an adorable little blown-glass octopus for my desk. Andy and the girl that work there most days are a blast to talk to, and they are very helpful and informative about the pieces. I would definitely recommend taking a look around, even if things are out of your price range. They have some pretty awesome stuff to look at! Some very unique designs and special gifts. Not just pewter other exciting things too. Great stuff to see and very intricate items that can be for a gift, memento or just for you. Some as small as your finger. Will come back again for more items \ud83e\udd29 We wanted a xmas ornament souvenir but didn't like the cutesy crabpot ones. Then we saw this one of the constitution (oldest floating commissioned warship) and could not resist. Very attentive staff and great crystal products at a reasonable price Went in to ask if they offer foreign currency exchange at this location. My question was ignored and I was asked if I had an account. Regardless if I have one or not, all I was asking was if the service was provided on site. Not very customer centric, they\u2019re all about opening new accounts. Fred, the supervisor, was extremely helpful to me, being able to solve problems that no one else on Call Customer Service or other bank employees could solve. Very helpful and friendly staff. Elijah helped me at the front desk and was great. The girl with green Santa hat is racist. Actually terrible bank. I zeroed out my account and they won\u2019t let me close it. Picked up a bottle of soda which cost $2.25.  I can get the same exact thing at the convenience store in Court Sq. for $1.25.  Mostly healthy snacks which aren't my favorites.  They do have nice fresh fruit for those who like a healthy snack.  Though it is expensive and doesn't have a very large selection of products it is a super clean store.  The owner was outside washing his windows as I went in.  The 7-Eleven 2 blocks away has many more options for less money. I love shopping at Staples! I always find great products, and the prices match the website. If there's any difference, the staff is always attentive and quick to fix it. The customer service is excellent, with a helpful and friendly team. I've never had any issues and always leave satisfied! Highly recommend! I always have a great experience shopping here! The customer service is outstanding, friendly, professional, and always ready to help. Every time I visit, I\u2019m impressed by how smooth and hassle-free the shopping experience is. That\u2019s why I always recommend this store to friends and family.\nDefinitely one of the best places to shop! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Just when I thought mega chains stopped caring, this Staples location changed my mind. I walked in and asked for a MacBook power adapter. Guy at checkout counter said \u201caisle 4\u201d. I went upstairs and was immediately greeted by another associate ready to help me find it \u2014 she'd been radioed that I was coming and knew what I needed! Found several options. Left within 5 minutes. A much better experience than Amazon, and I didn\u2019t have to wait for a delivery. Just stopped by Staples at City Hall Plaza to drop off a return shipment.  Easy, efficient, and friendly!  Duane could not have been more helpful and genuinely nice.  Really impressive employees at this Staples - thank you! Was looking for some inkjet printer ink, which is very expensive compared to the actual printer. The sales assistant was geeky, but extremely friendly, useful and effective. Explained how to navigate the Rewards system to get discount on the ink and points for giving back empty cartridges. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a pleasant experience. Doesn't happen too often when shopping. Reviews have largely been negative here, but I decided to check the situation out myself today. Only a few minutes wait at the teller line. Friendly and helpful staff and a helpful branch manager. Despite notes from the branch they are indeed welcoming new customers Bank ATM at this location took a deposit and went into error mode and didn't register the deposit.\n\nCalled the bank, and no one answered the phone. Don't ever use this branch. Initially, I was concerned about visiting this Financial Center in Boston because it did not have a promising rating on Google. However, to my surprise, my experience as a client was nothing short of extremely positive! This was all thanks to the irreplaceable senior banker, Rommel, whom I was fortunate to have as an assistant when resolving my issue. What struck me the most about Rommel was his professionalism, positive attitude, and sincere willingness to help. He guided me through all the available options for resolving my issue and maintained a calm and positive demeanor even when I was feeling stressed. He went above and beyond in his efforts to solve my problem. Even though, in the end, the problem could not be resolved immediately (due to my neglect), Rommel provided guidelines on how to proceed once I met all the terms and conditions, enabling me to solve the problem shortly thereafter (which I did). Working with Rommel has been a genuine pleasure as he is an exceptional specialist and a true asset that makes this particular BoA financial center shine! I had the pleasure of working with Rommel at Bofa more than a year, and I must say that while I wasn't very impressed with the bank as a whole, Rommel was an exceptional specialist and person. From the moment I reached out to him, Rommel was professional, courteous, and very knowledgeable. He took the time to understand my unique financial situation and provided me with a range of customized solutions to help me achieve my goals.\n\nWhat impressed me the most about Rommel was his attention to detail and his willingness to go above and beyond to ensure my complete satisfaction. He was always available to answer my questions and provided me with regular updates throughout the entire process. He truly made me feel like a valued customer.\nbusiness! Thank you, Rommel. It's truly pleasure to work with you. This place is an absolute joke! Raj, one of the representatives, couldn't do worse. He was extremely negligent and transferred over  $45,000 US to the wrong bank account and couldn't care any less to mitigate the damages. This was extremely infuriating for all of us and no one seemed to care about this place.\nHe never came to apologize and even walked in front of us after this issue was resolved and, in a very prepotent way, laugh at us and walked away. What kind of service is this? My entire family will be leaving this bank since this issue was the most disrespectful experience we've ever been through.\nThank you for making my mom cry BoA Came here two days in a row on our recent trip for the Blueberry Pie cocktail. Wonderful mix of vanilla vodka, butterscotch liqueur and blueberry Red Bull. The Paul Revere punch was also amazing. Fun lively atmosphere and the staff were attentive. Can\u2019t wait to come back! Better than I thought this place would be. I expected the usual tourist trap food standard, perhaps elevated slightly.\nNope, better. And everything was perfectly cooked. Exciting enough to be slightly different from everyone else, but the recipes were restrained enough so as not to take things over the top.\nWhen we first walked in, our server was looking totally bored on her phone, and I thought, \"Oh, here we go\". Also, nope! She was also perfect. Some of the best service ever.\nThe atmosphere had the right amount of old touches so that you could imagine yourself in a pub if you were so inclined. And they could have rested on their tourist-y laurels with that, but they don't.\nAnd it was all pretty dang affordable to boot.\nA+ to the owners and everyone we interacted with there. Absolutely blissful experience to be there. The staff was friendly, engaging and helpful. Right from the guy at the entrance to the server and everyone else, made us feel warmly welcome. We ordered vegan burgers, chicken quesadillas and loaded nachos which were super fresh, fresh and beautifully plated. Portion sizes were filling. Their collection at the bar is all inclusive (not pocket friendly if you\u2019re a student). All in all, 5 star experience. Walked there late at night and got drinks and ended up getting a couple of apps too, we are from Tennessee and every where we\u2019ve been to eat I\u2019ve ordered something that\u2019s a local thing instead of regular food I can get at home so I ordered the stuffed quahogs and man was they delicious!!! And the bartender lady was so super fantastic!!! If you\u2019re ever on vacation here, you gotta drop by this place!!! We were looking for a place to have our first lobster roll and Bell in Hand has made us absolute believers!\n\nThe hot lobster roll was abundant, juicy and the lobster was perfectly cooked. Granted it was 38$ (average price anywhere you go), but it was worth trying it!\n\nClam chowder was just thick enough and so packed with flavour, good deal for the price!\n\nFish tacos were crispy, spicy... Just perfect!\n\nA great place, would just appreciate seeing the prices up front (no prices for any alcohol), which felt odd. This is one of the oldest restaurants in boston so we visited while we were in boston.\n\nWe went for Thursday dinner without reservation but we were able to sit in and eat.\n\nThey have plenty of sitting booth and tables with cool decorations. It is definitely historical spot so it was really cool to eat in here. Our server was super nice and recommended some dishes .\n\nI recommend Ye Olde Seafood Platter which is deep fried shrimp, clams, calamari, oysters and fillet of fish topped with onion rings.  l also had lobster rolls, lobster mac and cheese, clam chowder, scallop , and shrimp pasta. Foods were okay. Compare to other lobster rolls that I had in NY or Boston it was nothing special. All main dishes serves with house corn bread and french fries which was super delicious.\n\nDefinitely check it out if you want historical dinning experience. We had a fantastic dinner at Union Oyster House, and it was truly a memorable experience. From the moment we walked in, we could feel the rich history of the place, which added so much charm to the evening. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the service was just as wonderful-our server was excellent, a really kind and attentive man who made sure we had a great time.\nAs for the food, everything was tremendous.\nThe oysters are an absolute must-fresh and delicious. The lobster roll was perfection, buttery and full of flavor, and the soup was the perfect comforting start to the meal. One of the highlights was their exclusive homemade Sam Adams ale, which was outstanding-smooth, flavorful, and a perfect pairing for the seafood.\nOverall, this restaurant is a must-visit, whether you're a local or just passing through.\nWe'll definitely be back! Food was good, nothing spectacular.\nThw service was warm and very friendly.\nBut the Atmosphere! Whoo! You could feel the ages in those walls. It was very cool sitting there, imaging some of the founding fathers and original patriots eating, drinking, meeting, planning, and living there!\nHistory buffs, take note: you gotta make a stop here. It's amazing. Had a great experience here dining with my wife for dinner. It's such a nice, historic restaurant and you feel that once you walk in. Our server Christine was excellent, really nice woman and the food was tremendous. Definite must-haves are the oysters of course, but also the broiled scallops, hot lobster roll and Boston Cream pie for dessert. Their exclusive Sam Adams colonial beer was absolutely terrific, great notes and flavor. Stopped here while in town and heard the clam chowder was amazing, which was absolutelytrue. It was the best I've ever had. The cornbread was tasty and a large serving. My husband had the scallops and I had the lobster ravioli. The historic building was well preserved giving a great atmosphere. The staff was friendly and the service was timely. My favorite burrito place. Love the steak one. Huge quantity and very tasty! Terrible. Avoid.\n\n- employees were shoveling the meats out without draining any liquids so the bowl I got had about 2/3 of a cup of liquid in it and soaked through the bag within minutes\n- cashier was on her cell phone\n- they only filled the guacamole container 80% of the way The staff were rude and unhelpful. They shoved two bags in my face, leaving me to figure out which one was mine, without a smile or even a simple \u2018thank you.\u2019 To top it off, I found a large bay leaf in the middle of my meal. Not impressed. Chipotle has gone down hill. You pay $22 for a brisket bowl, but you get a bowl loaded with rice, salsa, cheese and guacamole.\n\nThe server literally scoops the brisket, knocks some off the spoon and then put the scoop in your bowl.\n\nNo tea or punches. Just soda options.  Stale chips\n\nTotal rip off. We went here on a trip and at other places they give you free water cups but they would not give us any water cups (although they had 100s of them under the counter) and we had to buy a fountain drink. There was one section that was closed because of leaky A/C, so it was super hot in the building. I celebrated my birthday last night at The Oceanaire, and it was an incredible experience. Our server, Irving, was amazing he went above and beyond to ensure we had the best service and enjoyed our dinner. I highly recommend the oysters, as well as the shrimp and lobster fried rice! The ambience at The Oceanaire Seafood Restaurant is truly commendable. The d\u00e9cor is elegant, and the atmosphere is perfect for a relaxing evening out. The service was also impressive; the staff were attentive, friendly, and efficient.\n\nHowever, the food didn't quite live up to my expectations. While it wasn't bad, it was just okay. Given the reputation and price point of the restaurant, I expected a bit more in terms of flavor and presentation.\n\nOverall, it's a nice place for the atmosphere and service, but the food might leave you wanting more. Hello,\n\nI\u2019m writing as a loyal Landry\u2019s Select customer to provide my dissatisfaction with the service that I received when visiting your location in Boston.\n\nWe arrived at 7:30pm & waited for :25minutes to be seated even though no one else was waiting & I am a Landry\u2019s Select member.\nOnce we were seated, we ordered drinks. I ordered a sidecar that did not have the sugar on the rim as advertised so they quickly took care of the situation & brought out another drink.\nWe ordered our appetizers & main dish & was anxiously awaiting our meal. When my food was brought out it was the \u201cspecial\u201d branzino & not the simple grilled? I had to inform the waiter twice that I didn\u2019t order the special & he needed to send it back for the simple grilled.\nThey brought out a side of mash potatoes while I waited as everyone else was enjoying their entree. I wish there could have been an offer to bring out a meat/fish appetizer, not a starch.\nThey finally brought my simple branzino out & apologized. I had sat there about :18 minutes watching everyone else eat with mash potatoes staring me in the face.\nThey came out and asked if they could provide free desserts for the table. I\u2019m not trying to have anything else but 3 people in our party accepts the offer.\nOnce I receive the bill, I see that nothing was taken off my bill for guest recovery. I then asked if I could use my military ID Instead of my Landry select card since I would have gotten about $40 dollars off my bill with the food purchase. Isa said sure & took my ID. He comes back to tell me that this location does not accept military discount. I thought this was rather weird as all your other locations I\u2019ve been to definitely accepts military personnel id for discount. I went along with it but called the restaurant the next day & spoke with the hostess & she informed me that they did accept military discount as she confirmed with the manager that was there.\n\nI am really disappointed in the type of service I received & the blatant lie I was told when asked about military discount. I\u2019ve left a message on 10/28 & no one has contacted me to date. I\u2019m very upset at the level or lack there of service my party, especially I was put through in this visit.\nWill not be going back to the location \u201cEVER\u201d !\n\nI am attaching a copy of my check for your records.\n\nEric Wiley Great food, over bearing waiter who kept up selling - including our 15 yr old \"you want to add x with that\"... Had seafood tower- loved the shrimp because they were probably brined. The lobster and scallop dish was great - very fresh. The pie was extremely generous. Took 1 star off due to upselling. We\u2019ve gone here many times over the years and the food is continuously exceptional! However, for the past few visits the service has been extremely slow, especially considering the prices. Tonight, it took us 70 minutes for both of our appetizers to come in. We love the atmosphere, location and food and truly hope that Oceanaire can dramatically improve its service. Each year I come to Boston and when I do, this is always one my stops along the way. The service is great and extremely fast. The vibe is chill, with normal sounding without the need to scream to the person sitting next to you. Beers are solid if you enjoy tap and their nachos are amazing. Each year, it feels like the nachos get bigger and bigger. While I always finish my plate, this year the nachos definitely won. It was not busy when I went (late afternoon).  I was able to choose my own seat and chose the dining area up the steps.  Great ambiance- dark woods, copper hood over the fireplace.  Ordered drinks, onion rings (crisp and well-seasoned), and buffalo tenders (an app but more than enough for a meal).  The sauce had some heat but not too bad.  The chicken was moist, lightly breaded, and meaty.  Great service. There was a full service bar and outdoor seating too.  Would go there again. Went for drinks, fabulous cocktails!! Wonderful waitress, building is rustic and old and invites you to stay awhile and enjoy your company. Will definitely be back. Next time for food and drinks!! We came on a Sunday afternoon in December after several days of intense walks to get to know the city, it looks very local, the staff is very friendly, we ordered some nachos that were delicious and very loaded I definitely recommend the 21st Amendment! I was assigned Sophia as my server and she was both attentive and timely with all of our tables crazy requests! She seemed to have a lot of tables this night but made each table feel like a priority and made us feel very welcome. The food was also very very good, we got an order of nachos, margherita pizza and the buffalo chicken tenders and everything was to die for! 10/10 service, 10/10 food, we will be back soon! The road to advocacy needs fuel. Y'know, breakfast and lunch for the most part.\u00a0 So. Met up with my counterparts and fueled up before tackling legislators at the Statehouse across the street.\n\nThe gents behind the counter are personable, capable, and very much customer service oriented.\u00a0 They even gave me table service, which was appreciated since i had recently suffered a small fracture.\n\nI ordered a hamburger and fries, which were very tasty.and portions are generous.\u00a0 I want to return to try the rest of the menu.\u00a0 Especially on Friday for the fish and chips. Once I finished up at the Statehouse, I returned to grab a Greek salad to go, generous portions also.\n\nIn conclusion, another gem for when I'm in the area to frequent. This place is awesome! They provided great service, great food, and all at a price is reasonable! 5 stars. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Boston. Came when it wasn\u2019t very busy. No exaggeration, the fried eggs were the most perfectly cooked over-easy eggs I\u2019ve seen. They were cooked with no browning on each side of the eggs.\nCute little diner if you\u2019re near the Capitol. Great little breakfast/lunch counter.  Friendly service.  Great food.  Highly recommended.  Nothing fancy just smiles and food. Just happened to come across this place and it\u2019s just perfect, staff go above and beyond and food is outstanding! We stopped here for breakfast.  We ordered 5 egg, cheese, & bacon croissants.  The service was fantastic & the croissants were really good.  A plus is that we sat on the counter & had a ice view of the Massachusetts State House. Visiting the city, and lots of other restaurants and coffee shops.  This particular one might be good for regulars working in the area that want a typical cup of coffee.  When I asked for a London Fog, they looked grumpy and said it's not on the menu.  When I asked for a Hot Chocolate instead, they dumped a packet into a cup and added hot water.\n\nI don't think I remember any of the 3 people working there even attempting a smile or any basic friendliness at all.  Might all have been having a bad day.\n\nI ended up tossing it out, and got much better service just around the corner. This little place is nice. One way they could drastically improve is to put the food on real plates with real silverware. This is inside a building with a very cool history, it is across the street from the state house. I understand people try to save money, but for the people dining in, they need to have something of substance. I felt like I was camping using those cheap little plastic utensils. This is a wonderful little spot, with great food and friendly staff. The atmosphere is nice on a quiet morning, though be prepared for disposable dishware/cutlery, that's charming too.\nIt wasn't very busy around 7:30am, nice place to stop for a wonderful breakfast. The pancakes had a lovely texture, and the potatoes were crispy even if they might not look it! The absolute best pancakes I\u2019ve had in my life.\nPerfect shape and golden color.\nCrispy, crunchy edges.\nFluffy insides.\nPlentiful blueberries.\nFresh af. The original gyro is delicious! Meat is juicy and tender. Perfect, quick grab and go food for my time exploring Boston. Would visit again! Zo is one of my two go-to places for gyros.  Both of their brick-and-mortar locations, and their food truck, have some of the best gyros you'll find in the area.\n\nMy favorite is the \"original\":  pork gyro meat with tomato, onion, and tzatziki wrapped in a soft pita.  The meat is that salty and savory, complimented by the brightness of the tomatoes and onions.  Everything is pulled together and cooled down with a smothering of tzatziki.\n\nThese gyros are messy.  Don't bring a first-date here unless you want to look like you're incapable of feeding yourself.  On your way out, stop at CVS and pick up a roll of paper towels just so you can keep your composure while you feast.\n\nService here is *fast*.  If there's a line out the door, don't let it deter you... they fly through the line.  There is extremely limited seating in all of the locations, it's meant to be a takeout place. Outstanding Greek food in downtown Boston. Delicious, well-prepared items. They have some counter space inside, or you can do takeout. Their kale salad and lentil soup were excellent. And the baklava was a real treat. So glad we picked this place over sweetgreen. Delicious! Highly recommend this place. My go to for lunch. Very delicious Greek Gyro! Almost like the ones you'll eat in Greece.\nDefenitely recommend this place if you are looking to eat a Pita gyro in Boston! So, I visited the restaurant on a Monday evening around 7:30 p.m. When I entered, a lady led me to my table. I sat down and waited for about 20-25 minutes. The service seemed to be passing by, but they didn\u2019t even bother to ask if I needed anything. Frustrated, I started flashing my phone and putting it face down so that they could see it on the table.\n\nAfter a few minutes, a young man approached my table. He introduced himself with his right hand on his pocket and asked if I needed help. I ordered my food, which arrived promptly. I finished my food and beer and was ready to order another beer and fries. However, the guy disappeared for about another 30 minutes.\n\nWhen he reappeared, I ordered the second half of my order.\n\nIn summary, the service was terrible, but the ambiance was special. The live music was amazing, and the food was okay. I ordered fish and chips, an Irish beer, and fries. The fries were the only thing that was not good.\n\nHowever, the service was horrible for me. Maybe I was alone, and they didn\u2019t want to see me.\n\nWhen the bill is high, they prioritize customers who are with a group. Most of the time, if you have company sitting at the table, they will give you more attention.\n\nI decided to give the minimum tip to the guy and instead gave it to the musicians. They were the reason I stayed there for so long. Fun, rowdy bar with live music. Squeezed into a seat at the bar. Very much the Irish pub vibes. Listened to a really good live musician hitting the contemporary and traditional songs. Would have liked to try some food, but was happy to try the Black Rose Ale. Friendly crowd. It is loud!  But that\u2019s Irish pub for you!  I went there on Saturday night.  The food was amazing. If you can\u2019t make up your mind just get the sampler.  The live music started at 9pm and really got the crowd going. Food was a little on the cold side but tasty. Gets busy but other options in the area if you cant get in.  Had the Irish sampler trio...and plenty in the trio for two people.  Live music but starts latter in the evening. Neat place. I do believe this was the best food I\u2019ve had in Boston so far!!! Black rose iced Irish coffee, county cork, Jameson wings, hearty onion soup, Irish trio, and a Boston dip Got one of each hotdog, the chili dog was by far our favourite. Their fries were also quite good.\n\nI wish they had a New Yorker dog as well. \ud83d\ude1d\n\nNot a fan of the truffle ketchup, but the curry one was great A friend of mine recommended this place and as I was walking through Boston exploring the city, I decided to stop by for a quick bite. The menu is extensive and the staff are very nice. It\u2019s a order at the front and sit down serving yourself place.I\u2019ve included a photo of the menu below. I had the chicken sandwich with a side of fries and got the sauce, which was like a spicy mayo. The chicken itself was very tasty with a good crisp texture. Would definitely recommend checking this place out. The rap music was too loud and ruined the atmosphere in a nice building.\n\nI didn't finish the chicken sandwich that had a thin and greasy slice of chicken on it.\n\nThe fries were good! Great spot for burgers, craft beer and fries. Hipster decor and general cool aesthetic. Reasonable prices too. Everything on the menu has a vegan equivalent too. The food was incredible!!! I\u2019d love to go back again but hopefully the service will be slightly better!\nThere was no one in there but one guy who was on his phone and seemed bothered to serve us, the only customers in the restaurant lol.\nWill return regardless, just sucks that there\u2019s employees that slightly taint the experience\ud83d\ude15 Mr. Dooley's (Boston): Warm Irish Welcome and Fantastic Atmosphere!\nMy experience at Mr. Dooley's was excellent. The service was incredibly friendly and attentive \u2013 the staff truly made you feel welcome.\nThe ambiance is distinctly Irish, and the decor is really well done and creates a very cool and authentic feel. It's the perfect spot to soak in some traditional Irish pub vibes right here in Boston.\nOverall:\nIf you're looking for a place with genuinely friendly and welcoming service and a fantastic, well-executed Irish pub atmosphere, Mr. Dooley's is a must-visit in Boston! I enjoyed my meal! I went all out and had the fish and chips + potato skins + a side of mashed. The energy was high on a Tuesday evening, exactly what you\u2019d expect! It\u2019s hard to hear, not over music, but over voices, and I think that\u2019s special!\nFor some reason, many places don\u2019t do potato skins the way they used to and I appreciate Dooley\u2019s doing it the right way *with* the bacon on a lower level under the cheese to ensure its safe travels. I couldn\u2019t complain about the fish and chips if I tried.\nThe servers were busy but made adequate time for me. A true Irish Pub! Having been to Ireland, this place is as authentic as it gets! Had some Guinness, and had some friendly laughs with some gents from Dublin, Ireland. Great experience, a definite must! What a good Boston pub experience.\n\nThis place hopping on a Friday night - live Irish music and soooo many people gathered among the booths and bar. I came in later in the evening to grab a bite after a long travel day.\n\nI was able to seat quickly only on luck! There was literally one seat available in the small joint. Availability only grew more scarce!\n\nI ordered a house lager, some chowder, and their shepherds pie (to go). All of it was perfect. Really that shepherds pie was top notch! Among the best I\u2019ve had on either coast.\n\nSo stop in, take a load off. Stopped in here for a evening refreshment, and enjoyed the live music. Very friendly bartender, Terrence, was welcoming and efficient. Loved the overall vibe of this place. I did not eat here. They have a great whiskey selection as well as other beverages. This was right next-door to my downtown hotel. Just the best pulled pork I\u2019ve had anywhere. For sure. I\u2019ve been thinking about that pulled pork sandwich the rest of the day, it was absolutely delicious. Our waiter was also extremely pleasant, one of the nicest waiters I think I have ever had without being over the top fake-nice. Pleasant experience all around. Will be returning just for the pulled pork of course. Did I mention it was delish? The out side seating area was very accommodating for my group of 8 people, the atmosphere was very nice people around dinning as well but enough distances were we weren't listening to each others conversations. There were musicians station near by playing there music as well so it was a very good vibe. They also had a nice Jumbo screen for sport fans. The food was good, my burger was delicious but the bread underneath  did get soggy upon arrival and my bacon was definitely burnt. Other than this it was a good dish. No complaints from any of my party members in regards with there dishes. Nice place overall Food was delicious, with HUGE portions!! I didn\u2019t even come close to eating all of my meal. Service was excellent and atmosphere was incredible!! I highly enjoyed this place for lunch or dinner. I Just ate at Ned Devine\u2019s. The clam chowder was amazing, definitely  10/10. I ordered the Ned burger med rare,  it came out med well. There was nothing special about it 4.5/10. My wife got the Italian flat bread, again nothing special. Service and atmosphere were fine. Over all, do I regret going, No, it was good. Unfortunately, with the amount of restaurant competition out there a restaurant can\u2019t be good, it needs to be great in order for us to give them repeat business. I am a foodie and grade hard.\n\nThanks for allowing us to your restaurant. Came here with my wife while visiting Quincy Market in Boston. We had the beer battered chicken tender appetizer, a shrimp caesar salad, the salmon dish, a beer and a mixed drink. We were seated immediately which was nice and there was some live music just outside. Our server was very friendly and attentively, and our food came out very quickly. Other than recommending less dressing on the caesar salad, everything was great! Would return! The staff here are super friendly and helpful and they really work to make you feel comfortable and at home. Maintenance requests are responded to and handled in a timely manner. The appliances are great (except for the washing machine) and the amenities are as well. My only issue is the presence of mice within this building. I moved in 3 months ago and noticed the presence of mice within two weeks. My apartment is clean as it is just myself. They knew that there was a rodent problem on this side of the building because apparently this side I moved on was left wide open during the summer months before construction was started or complete. The first time the exterminator arrived, they noticed the presence of many mouse droppings. They patched some holes which was indicative of a lack of a thorough inspection prior to me moving in. Since then, I have had an exterminator visit my apartment often. I have a hole in the bottom of my couch from moving and suspected that they have made a nest there. I taped it twice with duct tape and it has been completely removed by the mice both times. I have been told many times that they cannot guarantee that my apartment will eventually be free of rodents. When I pressed them about the fact that this was not acceptable they sent an exterminator and then reported that they said they didn\u2019t see any presence of mice despite the fact that he did not inspect my apartment this time but replaced a bait station because he said it had been eaten. They have insisted that this did not happen. It has been an extremely frustrating situation. You have to pay to have pets in your apartment but rodents come free :) I toured Anthem Everett yesterday. It was a beautiful building and you can tell it was very thoughtfully designed in every detail. Location is a bit sketchy but not the worst. That said, I got a really strange vibe.\n\nI have toured ~10 different buildings and complexes around Boston over the last few days. I asked the same questions on every tour, including occupancy rate (to understand how full/crowded things like amenity spaces might get) and if there were a lot of dogs in the building (I have 2.) Anthem Everett was the ONLY property that refused to answer these questions. The leasing agent stonewalled me and said \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to share that\u201d and said it was for \u201cresident privacy reasons.\u201d What? What a ridiculous thing to say. I\u2019m not asking for demographic information or details about residents - I just want to know if the building is crowded or not, and if my dogs will have other pups to play with.\n\nListen, I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. I could tell most of the units were sitting empty because door after door we passed on the tour had a little sticker over the peephole. It just felt like they were trying too hard to manage impressions instead of being open and transparent. It makes it really hard to trust a management company if they are gonna be sketchy about the littlest things like this.\n\nIt\u2019s too bad because I would have applied if it hadn\u2019t been for this detail. Anthem is truly exceptional!\u00a0Im so glad I found this place. It feels like every detail has been thoughtfully designed to make everyone feel specil and welcomed. From the beautiful amenities to the modern apartments, including the management team being super friendly, responsive, and dedicated to the residents.\nLiving at Anthem is both comfortble and convenient in many ways.\nI highly recommend this apartment, specially if you want to be close to Boston (without spending your entire life's savings), while still living in a vibrant, high-quality place. I recently moved into Anthem Everett, and I cannot say enough about how helpful the leasing team has been throughout the entire process. Luisa and Marcus, in particular, went above and beyond to assist me with my transition. They were patient, attentive, and more than willing to answer the myriad of questions I had about the community and the leasing process.\n\nThis move was very important to me, not only personally but also for the future of my work, and they both understood that perfectly. Their professionalism and dedication truly made me feel confident about choosing Anthem Everett as my new home. I highly recommend both the community and the fantastic support from the team here! Moved here a little over a month ago, and this place is pristine. Almost gives off spa like vibes. Super aesthetic, very clean, and everything smells good. The place is very tastefully designed, and as a bonus, the staff is super sweet and fun. Special shoutout to Marcus, Queen and Bailey :) A decent instalment of a very popular chain of fast food restaurant. After ordering and while waiting for my food someone else took my food without anyone checking. The staff did replace my taken order but it was a hassle and long winded effort that could have been avoided if some form of checking was in place when handing out food to people waiting. To the family runnin the joint....TOAST THE BAGELS.  Its crazy to send it through to just warm it.  Toast the bagels, youre nuts and google the word toast I went there a half hour before closing, and they were out of iced tea. They said it was because it was close to closing. They were too lazy to keep up their iced tea so that customers could be satisfied. Very discouraging.  I left without buying anything. This is not about this particular store but Dunkin' Donuts themselves. I heard so much about these \"donuts\" that I had to try it. To me, they were just ordinary donuts. Nothing special about them or the coffee. One thing about the coffee. I've bought iced coffee from different coffee places and this is the first time someone asked me what I wanted in it. That was surprising \ud83d\ude40. Every other time it was served \"black\". Good sized Dunkin with some seating inside. I came to this coffee store simply to get a coffee waiting on a jury verdict for my son's murder trial. I asked the address to a black male claiming to be the manager and he yelled at me ... he literally yelled at me saying I already gave you the address the other people who worked there appeared to be frightened to say anything. that is so odd to me(. I politely asked him to please repeat the address, because there's government station and Tremont.. )\nI didn't send my order to the wrong address. He yelled at me again. \"I'm NOT GIVING UOU THE ADDRESS AGAIN..I GIVE TO YOU!\"\nA CUSTOMER HAD TO CLARIFY THE ADDRESS!!!!\n( I asked him maybe if he was having a bad day- we all have them... because of course I wouldn't have written this)\nHE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL ME IF MY ORDER HAD COME THROUGH ON THE MACHINE. DUNKIN' DONUTS IS $5 A COFFEE DOWN HERE NEAR THE COURTHOUSE SO OF COURSE WE WANT TO KNOW...\nHe just glared at me and shoved my coffee at me!!!!)\nNEVER IN MY LIFE... HAVE I TREATED THIS BADLY BY AN EMPLOYEE AT A DUNKIN DONUTS......AND YOU'VE MADE HIM A MANAGER????? I work at the courthouse with many people and I will be sharing this with them because I was actually feeling really badly that he was being so rude and those mopping and sleeping around him looked so uncomfortable... they look like they wanted to just clarify the address but they were scared!!\nhis own employees. (as you can see I write dozens of reviews for places in Boston and I don't like to mess with someone's employment )...but this man cannot possibly be this rude and maintain his job.\n(this was 16 Tremont Street at about 1:00 p.m. November 14th) Daouia is a fantastic counter person. I am a senior and have been to thousands of Dunkin Donuts rarely have I seen such excellent customer service. She always greets me and other customers with a big smile and is quick to get you your coffee and donut. She must be the manager and if so deserves a raise.\nMy office is next door and I look forward to getting my coffee each day because of her. Vincent Vadeboncoeur My coffee is perfect EVERY SINGLE time. I go here about 1 time a week and its better than the one across the street. Food is always good too. No parking because its near government center. Does not have Handicap access. This place was somewhat busy yesterday. They only had one guy working the entire store. There was an explosion of mess behind the counter, things looked dirty (health department issues??) We waited for a long time but eventually had to leave as it would have taken us an hour plus to get our drinks. It's not the barista's fault, he was running around trying to do everything and seemed exhausted. Shame on management for not properly staffing. Clean.  Empty.  Quick service.   Sounds good to me for a quick drink on a cold November morning. While we were on a walking tour of Boston, we got hungry and started keeping an eye out for places we could eat at when the tour was over with. We passed B.Good and saw the Beyond Burger sign in the window. BINGO! That's our place, being a vegan and a vegetarian and knowing how good Beyond products are. We went back after the tour and got our burgers. Very, very good! Better than we make them at home. A great tasting bun, tasty B.Good sauce, totally recommend it. The place was clean, the staff were wearing masks, they were socially distancing the customers, even the bathrooms were nice.  The burgers totally hit the spot and rubbed it out! My order was banana peanut butter with choco and my friend was a mix. I think her tasted better haha. Because my banana was not sweet enough to balance out the whole flavour, think a little honey will be nice Looking for a healthy lunch while touring and found this near freedom trail.  My wife and daughters were excited about menu. I got the roasted root and mushrooms bowl with chicken.  Kind of costly but fresh food costs more. Party also got Turkey burger, harvest kale and zucchini spaghetti.  All was very tasty. Roasted root and mushroom was a bit odd not knowing what should be hot and cold. Some was luke warm but still good. Great relativly fast service. Slight language barrier for food pickup calls. Love the fresh, organic, clean look and feel and offerings. Even the ketchup was bomb! This is a great spot.  Will definitly visit this chain again! Need dessert options however! I love b. Good! Food is always fresh and service is always friendly. I definitely recommend getting the app since they always add \"gifts\" And you can avoid long lines by ordering ahead. I'm obsessed with the zucchini noodles and eggplant \"meatballs\"! The dish has fewer calories than a salad but tastes so good. The eggplant actually tastes like real meatballs too! I hope this never rotates off the menu.. I'll be devastated. i would not recommend this place. it seems overhyped and not worth the money.\n\nfood:\n-short rib broth was unseasoned. the ramen noodles were mushy, and there was not enough space in the bowl to actually eat properly. the meat was tender, but not that flavorful.\n-the bao bun was greasy and pork belly was small and dry\n-the tokyo fries were super greasy, so it was only good for a couple bites. the meat was good though.\n\natmosphere: essentially a food court with dim lighting. the lighting was weird though bc it was alternating dim and bright fluorescent lights, and if you get the table under fluorescent lights then it can be pretty blinding\n\nservice:\nwaiter was nice but attentiveness could be better. didn't really check on us at all. he was nice to switch out a cocktail when we didn't like it though. I love this place. It's always quick and easy to eat at for those on a work lunch. I would say I come here at least once every 2 months or so. I think the portion sizes are great and they have a good variety. Wagamama in Dubai set the bar high for me--I've slurped up their ramen at least 20+ times and loved every bowl. So, imagine my excitement when I spotted it in Boston! Unfortunately, the ramen here didn't quite hit the same. The broth lacked that deep, rich flavor I was craving. But hey, silver lining--the calamari? It is crispy, flavorful, and totally saved the meal Amazing as always.  Great food,  great service!! Definitely make rsvp. We made reservations in advance so not sure how long the wait would be.  I guess would depend on the day! An authentic Japanese restaurant, they remain true to their motto of cooking with passion and soul.\nIt's in the Quincy market Fanueil Hall, a spacious and warm space. They have indoor and outdoor seating.\n\nWe had the famous Asahi Beer. Asahi means sunlight in Japanese. It's a dry beer, a must try if you are a beer lover.\n\nThe host was kind enough to suggest us a spicy beef  dish called Beef Firecracker. Originally they make it with chicken but for us they customized it with Beef.\nHot and spicy sauce with rice and delicious beef, vegetables, this dish soothed our hunger and soul.\n\nThanks for the best meal in Boston!! This place gets a bad wrap in the reviews but the bagels \ud83e\udd6f are actually really good!  And among my fav in terms of their texture and flavour!\n\nCoffee is amazing and with so many varieties too, of hot and cold!\n\nThe problem is the atmosphere is blah and service is spotty!  From the tables you can see iconic Boston buildings, so if they spruced it up a bit and kept it clean what a difference it would make!\n\nAlso the people making the bagels are dialing it in!  Pump some music, some fun and get people who are motivated and bam \ud83d\udca5 you would have a great spot on your hands! Let me just say I am a returning Bostonian due to a medical emergency my son is currently going through.  I'm also a Dunkin Queen.  I'm going to have to become a Bruegger's Queen now. They have NY style bagels!\n\nTheir everything bagels are in a word AWESOME.  The coffee is tasty. They also have a Monday Bagel Bundle, among other incentives.\n\nBut you've got to come in for the Sublime Customer Service.  There's a Mr. Stanley who (I'm unsure of his official title), but he took the time on a busy Monday to ensure my bundle was prepared properly and to my satisfaction.  Ms. Karisa took the time to assist me with the Bruegger App.  I downloaded it last week but had not explored it.\n\nThe patience, courtesy, knowledge, and all-around people skills from the cashier (Andrew) to the rest of the staff working efficiently and effectively to make the running of this establishment run like clockwork was refreshing\n\nI have determined that I will be returning at least twice monthly, especially on Mondays;-) I really wanted this to be a great bagel sandwich. It was extremely average. The place was clean inside, and the staff were very friendly. It was just a matter of an average bagel with an average egg and sausage. I won\u2019t go back. Today was the last straw. One of the worst bagels I\u2019ve ever had. Incredibly hard\u2014enormous air bubble. Also, burned.  Nearly inedible, i threw half of it away. Extremely nice staff, and I may come back, but consistently burns bagels and the quality just isn\u2019t there. Bagels are fantastic. Had a brisket sandwich and a jalepeno bagel separately. Great bagels and decent coffee, I will come back for breakfast the rest of my time in Boston.  Only critique is the signage of where the pickup and order lines are. Took a moment to figure it out and watched countless others struggle also. Regardless, fantastic bagels They offer a wide variety of salads and grain bowls. The ingredients are high-quality, and the customizable options make it easy to find something you\u2019ll enjoy. However, the prices can be a bit steep for a casual meal, and the lines during peak hours can be long. Overall, it\u2019s a great choice for a lunch break. Bowls are good. They also featuring protein-rich bowls. Great food but could have more pre-made vegan options. The shroomami is amazing and the portions are good, but I just wish there was more variety for vegans. I know I can build my own bowl but it would be so much easier to just order an item and be done with it. really good, healthy food and excellent service. shout out to karen for great service despite a crazy post-new year's lunch rush. it takes serious skill to keep things going when the place is so busy. props to the staff :) This place specializes in local organic ingredients for quality salads! They offer a full array of ingredients so you can choose one of their salads or create your own. I loved my salad. Their drink selection would be the short coming here. But water works! We love the Chicken!  Nashville Hot is so juicy and tender.   Fries are crispy.   Onion rings were delicious.   We really couldn't go wrong with anything we ordered.   Another bonus is the dog friendly patio with water dishes for my dad's pup! Parking is plentiful with warm friendly service. If you love the comfort of a down home farm to table atmosphere \u2014 in the middle of a cornfield \u2014this may be your place. Prices are reasonable with a menu full of creative options. The boasted  drumstick and wing was crispy and well seasoned. The house baked beans were exceptional as well as the deviled eggs which were my favorite. Stop in and give them a try even if you have to wait fifteen minutes due to a slamming crowd! I've always had good food here with one exception, perhaps my own fault. Ordered online. Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and gravy as a side and a side of gravy to dunk the chicken in. I expected chicken gravy and got cream gravy. I didn't see any specific mention of what style was included but I don't usually see cream gravy served with mashed potato and assumed it would be chicken gravy. That said, everything but the mashed potatoes has been wonderful. It's been a long time since this order but they were under seasoned and kinda brown. I haven't had them since. My experience today with the fish and chips was delightful! Not too crazy tartar sauce, properly battered fish, well seasoned fries, tasty coleslaw, and a proper wedge of lemon to zest things up if you desire. Fast, hot, and tasty! Wow!  Never been here before but I will definitely be back!!!  Great selection of beer, drinks, and food.  And the food was awesome!!!! Can't have about it enough. Excellent food, fun atmosphere- this place is a gem!\nThe food was absolutely delicious, I can\u2019t wait to go back and try more dishes.\nI love the decor and vibes of this place. $40 lobster flight comes with soda and chips\n\nWhite truffle was good, but I realized that I like lobster very lightly seasoned, if at all. Lemon butter let the natural flavor of lobster shine the most. Spicy honey butter was okay\n\n6oz meat is not a lot of food, it\u2019s more of a tasting experience\n\nCasual place for dine in, pay first at counter I\u2019ve been to Luke\u2019s Lobster places in Vegas and NYC but was eager to try it here in Boston closer to its origins in Maine. It didn\u2019t disappoint. I had the combo rolls and clam chowder. The seafood was fresh and tasty and the clam chowder was great. Delightful experience. Quick and delicious meal. My husband and I each had a lobster roll. He had the lobster bisque and I had the clam chowder. Relaxed and casual atmosphere. There is no alcohol here but a variety of Bottled sodas is offered. It\u2019s just as delicious as the reviews say! The soda they offer is also very tasty and unique. There are three different sizes, each with a corresponding price. For a lobster roll, the price seems quite reasonable. Great place for a quick lobster roll or bowl of chowder. Fresh seafood, very well prepared, and flavorful.  Small inside so be prepared to wait for a table when busy.  Will return. Great spot for lunch and dinner. Food is excellent and service even better. The food is on the healthy side and they have a lot of vegan/vegetarian options. We got the bowls and they were delicious with the baked tofu and roasted sweet potatoes \ud83c\udf60. We also tried the corn \ud83c\udf3d bread for free as a courtesy for leaving a review on google. The setup inside is nice and the restaurant is on the self service side. They have about 16 seats inside. Terrible, I had a piece of rubber in my lunch bowl from Dig. Dangerous for your health to eat here, very worried if there were smaller pieces, which I didn\u2019t notice and ate. It\u2019s a shame. Stay away from this place. Fed my family of 5 for $60 (including tip), every food item wad amazing, and the service was fast and considerate. I don't do reviews. But today I had to. Made my own tofu bowl and it was amazing! Enjoyed with rice, carrots and Brussels sprouts along with vegan ranch! So delicious. Wish there were locations in Florida. Highly recommend this place for a quick, healthy and yummy lunch or dinner. Food is delicious. Fresh ingredients, plenty of gluten-free vegan options, and rich in flavor. I made my own bowl and got the greens with the tomato cucumber salad and potato salad with salmon and the pesto dressing. I agreed it's a bit on the salty side. The space feels a little bland. Best beef and chicken shawarma I have had in a long time!! Everything was top notch and very tasty, fresh and delicious \ud83d\ude0b\nThe gentleman was so nice that also offered us some samples of felafel which were also delicious!!\n\nIf you are in town you definitely must try this place! Be aware portions are HUGE so might want to share if you don\u2019t eat a lot. Excellent Vegetarian Falafel at this location,  authentic taste, especially thanks to the man John  who made my order he was so humble and helpful, with amazing customer service.  I really appreciate my friend for making my lunch. Great vegetarian options as you would expect. Service was awesome. I got the falafel, hummus, tabbouleh wrap and absolutely loved it! Great flavor! Would come again easily! I'm absolutely smitten with this place! The falafels were bursting with flavor and had the perfect texture. Though the wrap was a bit too moist for me, it didn't ruin the experience. Plus, you get generous portions at reasonable prices. Can't wait to go back! I love this halah spot. One of my favorites and I have tried many. They have the best plates hands down. Boston Shawerma is honestly one of my favorite spots. The food is super high quality and the prices are really reasonable. With any order, they give you a free Dasani water which is such a nice touch. The people there are so kind and welcoming every time I go in.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how generous the owner is. I saw a few delivery drivers come in to pick up orders, and the owner offered them food and drinks just out of kindness. You don\u2019t see that often. It\u2019s the kind of place that makes you feel good about supporting a local business. Great food, great people, great vibes. The Shawarma tastes great. But I don\u2019t have any service. The sauce smells like peanut. The price is higher than I expected. The staff is very sweet and friendly. Unfortunately, the shawarmas my friend and I got were bland and did not taste like shawarma meat. Similarly, the baklava was underwhelming \u2014 flavorless and lacking in pistachios and rose flavoring. what an insanely large portion and so much variety in food in one plate. solid flavors too, I wouldn\u2019t say the meat was incredible but it wasn\u2019t distractingly dry or anything. It\u2019s solid. it\u2019s like a time machine to when things were 5$, i think 20$ is worth it when you get a bit of everything and they aren\u2019t trying to pinch pennies on the size of a falafel or meat like cava Solid shawarma spot with generous protein. The food was served very quickly so this spot is perfect on the go too. The food is really flavorful too so I do think this is also very worth the price that you pay. Would highly recommend stopping by here to grab a quick meal! A robot cooks your food, and it tastes great too! Very busy at lunchtime, with good reason. Menu is a short list of customizable stir-fry bowls and you can watch the robot cook in front of you. There are vegetarian and vegan options and you can add and subtract specific ingredients, but the drinks are unsweetened and not great. Paying with cash looks like it might be inconvenient, but otherwise the ordering kiosks are handy. It's definitely a novelty to try at least once. Food taste: 9/10\nCustomizable bowl options. It\u2019s very interesting how the food is prepared. Friendly staff.\n\nI went with my family. We tasted all the three juices available in the restaurant. We did not like them much. This place is very neat and they do offer different types of bowl to eat with different base and sauces. I have attached the menu with the post if you want to check what are the items available here.\nThe only issue I had with the food is even though it was tasty it was very less in quantity. And I had to eat something else as I was still hungry after the whole bowl. Quick self-help service. Order on screen. Everything was customizable for my bowl, so it is somewhat friendly to food intolerances and I was mostly satisfied, but I would not have many options if I were to go there often. The sauces and spices don't leave much options if you are sensitive to those things. Interesting to watch the automatic cooking mechanism. Odd thing is that not all toppings are available to select in all the bowls. Some of us couldn't get the topping that was available to another person - that part is not transparent. Good price though. Love the concept...first time eating from robotic machines. Food was fresh, delicious,  good portion and we thoroughly enjoyed watching ther cooking process.  Superb customer service too..the manager was super helpful and explained the history to us. Great going MIT guys!! The food was okay but the service was so poor that we certainly won\u2019t be returning. The guy who made the sandwiches couldn\u2019t care less about us being there (although there was only one single other client at the restaurant), did not really answer any questions, and was not very friendly overall. It was a very strange experience, felt like we were burdening them with us ordering food. We wanted to originally dine in but decided to leave because we did not felt welcome. The worst service I\u2019ve ever seen messed up three sandwiches wouldn\u2019t even listen to what I want on the sandwich after I told her don\u2019t throw it away. I\u2019m more than happy to pay for it. I\u2019ll just give it away to someone wouldn\u2019t even listen kept on making mistake after mistake at some point I just wanted to walk out. This guy literally saved my day. The place was almost closed and they still prepared a sandwich. My first meal of the crazy day. Thanks! Decent food but horrible service. The store was empty, and the employee certainly didn\u2019t look happy seeing me come in. When asked if I was picking up, I answered that I was placing an order. The employee pointed to the \u201corder here\u201d sign and didn\u2019t say anything. When I ordered, what I assumed was them repeating my order back to me, felt condescending as if he couldn\u2019t understand me. I had walked over towards the register and noticed they stopped making my order and had gone back to the task they were previously working on before I came in. I had asked to add extra toppings/sauces, and they pointed to their toppings section and said, \u201cAdd there.\u201d When I listed my toppings, they would repeat each ingredient after adding it then pause for the next one, making me repeat myself several times for the rest of the toppings I wanted \u2014 which is fine, but I didn\u2019t appreciate the attitude that came with it. Very unfriendly environment, I would not come back again. This place has a prominently displayed pot for fresh brewed iced tea, which I love. I was there around supper time, and they actually don't have fresh brewed iced tea - when I asked for it they said they don't actually have it - that the pot was empty.  I pointed out how odd it was to have the pot but not actually have the tea.  The girl I was talking to didn't seem to care.  She said she only works nights and doesn't know what they do in the mornings.  I left without buying anything.  It was frustrating for them to advertise that they have something they don't actually have.  It seems like a terrible way to run a business. Edit::: Emailed almost a week ago and haven't heard anything back\n\nI have been to the Pigeon Forge location multiple times and had an absolute blast! So I was  looking forward to trying out the Madiera beach location since we live not too far away in hopes to have the same great time. My husband and I dined in today around 1130-1145am 3/14/2025. It was just us and another table the whole time we were there. The service(entertainment)/food was mediocre at best, None of the throwing napkins/straws and barely any mean-ness that we experienced in Pigeon Forge. Kind of felt forced by our server. We ordered the bbq  nachos and Hawaiian P.I.G tacos. Although it all looked delicious, the Pork was cold on both items. I was so looking forward to this visit and left disappointed. Stephanie was the funniest chick! She had us laughing from the moment we sat down and totally made our experience at Dick\u2019s Last Resort one to remember. Her quick wit, savage comebacks, and hilarious attitude fit the vibe perfectly. 10/10 would come back just for her! Phoenix provided exceptional service at Dick's Last Resort. Their attentive and humorous approach made the experience enjoyable. Prompt service and a great attitude really enhanced our visit. Highly recommend! Let\u2019s start with how excited we were that sucks came around to the neighborhood, couldn\u2019t wait to have a seat. We came with family and friends that evening. Ordered drink appetizer and meals. Everything came at one time. Drinks had no alcohol and I rarely drink and mine tasted like fruit punch. The nachos were cold pork was gross like came out of a can cold. I ordered the appetizer sampler and everything was undercooked . Fried pickles barely fried filled with grease, tenders to light to attempt to eat, scared to eat the wings didn\u2019t want to become sick. Even my friends sampler was the same only thing edible was cheese sticks and they were actually lightly fried as well. Didn\u2019t eat anything manager comes over asking how everything is and before we can even answer he smiles and says great thanx for coming in & walks off.?! We looked at each other at table like seriously \ud83d\ude33 didn\u2019t say much but for $150 plus tip for $180 was ridiculous for food couldn\u2019t eat. My friend took it all home and said they would finish cooking it to eat. Yes I gave tip because server didn\u2019t cook the food even tho she wasn\u2019t very communicative or nice but then it\u2019s dicks so. Also salad was so soggy. Husband said his pull pork sandwich was cold but ate it cause he was so hungry. Idk if we will ever be back and disappointed even the hat situation that everyone gets excited for was disappointing she just came over and threw them on our heads. I\u2019ve been to the Gatlinburg location in the past and decided to take some family to this new Madeira Beach location one recently.\nWe had a blast! Kyle was great as our server and asked before going too far with any of his entertainment due to us having young teens with us. Which was appreciated. We all agreed that the food was really good too!\nIF YOU\u2019VE NEVER BEEN HERE - just know before you go what kind of entertainment you\u2019re going here for \ud83d\ude01 You cannot beat this authentic Mexican bistro it\u2019s gourmet, but they don\u2019t have gourmet prices. They make everything in house. You don\u2019t have to speak Spanish, but it would probably help. Haha. The Mole  burrito is my go to spicy happy. They made it through the pandemic. Some of us barely did. Really great place to get fast casual Italian food for lunch/ on the go dinner! The special sandwich I had was delicious (eggplant one on Tuesdays). The bread was delicious and strong enough to hold the generous amount of innards that are given. Atmosphere is friendly, service quick, and prices are very nice! 10/10 would recommend! I really liked the service (the employees were nice) and the shop (small, but vibrant place in the North End). The sandwich I got was good for sure, but didn't blow \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f me away. It's very possible I ordered the wrong thing, though, as it seems that this place has very high reviews! Food is excellent. Every sandwich I've had has been great. Its consistent and high quality. Their bread is probably the best in the city. I usually don't stay there to eat-its small. Lady at the register will sneakily add 1-2 dollars to the already high menu prices when ringing you up. Good food and big portions but not worth having to keep your guard up for what should be a casual lunch interaction. Has been this way for years, only gotten worse since the pandemic and their failed second location. I'll continue to only go here when I have a craving I can't ignore.\n\nEditing in response to owner (5 months later?): I actually said the food was very good, I'm not sure what the animosity is for. It's useful for other people to know to keep their guard up at the checkout counter even if I didn't one time. The price gets typed in by hand and happens very fast, I regret not saying something in time but shouldn't have to. Really, this place has high ratings already, I am only here to add context for future visitors and clearly am a long time customer. No untruths spewed here. Food was delicious. Bit pricey for what I am used to (Not from Massachusetts), but on par for the Boston area. The shrimp roll and lobster Chowda were delicious. So much flavor in both items. The area of the hall for seating is pretty terrible, can be total chance if you can find a seat to eat, especially if you're in a group or have your family with you, but thats nothing against the restaurant itself. Best clam chowder I\u2019ve ever had , we made sure to go everyday when we were in town . The seating is limited but that didn\u2019t stop us . We got the cold lobster roll on our first day and the hot butter lobster roll the next and it was delicious . I still prefer the cold over the warm sandwich. Everything was amazing \ud83d\ude0c 10/10 Great portions of clams, potatoes & I liked the flavor and thickness of broth for chowda. I made a mistake getting a small one. The lobster rolls bread was toasted and buttered perfectly with generous portions of lobster meat. I had Neptunes last night, and this one is way better AND THE GUYS were great. Big smiles and friendly. I\u2019ll be back every time I visit Boston. But for now, I\u2019m about to walk back and get another cup of soup. I used to visit occasionally for the lobster roll and clam chowder when working nearby, but I will never return. On my last visit, I chose \u2018no chips\u2019 while ordering, but the staff reacted by yelling angrily in a loud voice. I felt scared and ended up putting some money in the tip jar just to ease the tension. The unprofessional attitude left me feeling very sad and disappointed. It\u2019s an award winning Chowder soup, have to wait about 20mins. Most people buy a Lobster roll with chowder set. It cost around $35, price is fine. For the Lobster roll, it does not have heavy seasoning, just mixed butter and offer you lemon to bring the flavor. Allow you to taste original Lobster, and the bread is soft and yummy. Chowder is ok, enough creamy and delicious. They offer you cookie to put in the soup to add the crunchy element. It ok to be a mark dish for tourists visit here. Honored to be the first google review of Bertuccis Pronto. I grew up going to Bertuccis in Beverly MA, and this was a great throwback for me. Service was exceptional the moment I walked in- as Jaylene took my order efficiently and smiley! All the cashiers and management were very sweet, On top of their game, and I\u2019m really hoping this new Season for Bertucci\u2019s follows through well.\n\nMy only tip would be to have the famous bertuccis oil with the bread! Wings were not good Excellent food, even better service! Great pizza and very friendly staff! The lady manager was super helpful \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d Cold storage facility they have a presence nationwide and all over the East cost. Keeping it fresh is their business \ud83d\ude0c Me and Bradley love this company. I can have fish \ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc1f. I myself kinda like fish. We stopped in for a late lunch. The service was excellent, friendly and prompt. The server was the first person I have had ask me about food allergies, and when I responded yes further inquired if the fries being prepared in the same oil as calamari would be a problem, or should she offer something else. Virtually no one understands the severity of a shellfish allergy, so thank you.\n\nI had a bloody Mary which was huge and tasty. My partner had a gin and tonic, which he reported was also well prepared. He had a crispy chicken sandwich, which he enjoyed. I had the meatball sub without cheese and it was ok. Bland sauce, to me. The fries were crispy and golden. I could not finish my meal, so to me the portion was large.\n\nLively spot with multiple TVs playing sports programs. Live music in the evenings. Lunch special of half price sandwich if you order a drink. Despite arriving after the cutoff time, I noticed our service had given us the discount. I'd give it another try and try something different on the menu next time. The burger I enjoyed here was surprisingly one of the better ones I've had along bars in Boston! It's not too expensive, the servers are absolutely lovely, and while the noise and atmosphere sometimes can be a hoot, what do you expect? It's a bar in Boston. I will absolutely return here for drinks after work given the opportunity! A decent bar in Boston with good food.\n\nWe came for dinner after grabbing drinks at a few of the historical bars nearby. The food was good.\n\nThe Point is sort of boring compared to every other place nearby, but they had lots of availability, good food, and terrible service. It took 20 minutes to get our credit card back after paying for the check.\n\nWith all the more interesting nearby options it's hard to recommend them . Awesome spot near TD Garden. I like that they offer an all-day brunch menu and was able to enjoy a Bloody Mary, which was super tasty with awesome toppings. We ended up with the clam chowder and salads, and we were very happy with everything all around. great little spot for a drink. really amazing food and the service was amazing. would definitely recommend visiting I used to work right by this Dunkin and would stop by for a few munchkins after work sometimes as a treat. The staff was great and one worker would even give me extra munchkins which absolutely made my day. Good location to grab a coffee to go (there\u2019s no seating) after getting off the Metro. Very clean store, fast friendly service, and a great tasting drink, the Watermelon Lemonade, light on the ice! One of the better Dunkies for speed. Always a clean place as well.\n\nI wish more places would realize that not every breakfast item needs \"eggs\" if you can even call them that. Nice small dunkins. Service is incredibly fast but hardly accurate. I would head down another two blocks to the dunkins on the corner. Much better chances of getting your order correct. Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House in Boston has long been a favorite of mine. Nestled in the historic Old City Hall building in Downtown Boston. The ambiance is a blend of rich history and timeless elegance, with high ceilings, grand windows, and lovely woodwork  wainscoting, wine cabinets, and moldings.\n\nUpon arrival, we were warmly greeted by three hosts. The waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable. And then, there\u2019s the food. Ruth\u2019s Chris is renowned for its steaks, and the t-bone I had was a true masterpiece. Cooked to perfection in their signature 1,800-degree broiler, it arrived sizzling in butter, with each bite melting in my mouth.\n\nDo note that sides are served \u00e0 la carte so plan accordingly.  Reservations are highly recommended.\n\nWhether you\u2019re celebrating a special occasion or simply indulging in an extraordinary meal, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House is a must-visit. My friend and I stopped in for dinner and Israel (the bartender) provided exquisite service and made our time there relaxing, enjoyable, and memorable!! This location was unique, beautiful, and rich with history. Our food was cooked to perfection and our drinks were absolutely delicious!! The manager John also made sure we were well taken care of and everything was perfect for us!! I would without a doubt recommend making a stop into the Ruth\u2019s Chris in Boston the next time you are in town it was an all around wonderful experience :) thank you again to the staff for going above and beyond to make us feel welcomed, ensuring we had an excellent time, and our food was better than ever!!! I came to eat and drink for my niece's wedding rehearsal dinner. I had such a great time celebrating with the family that I barely took pictures of the food served. The steak and chicken that we ate were delicious!  And the old fashioned drink i had was great. So much so, it was the only thing I saved in my picture roll. I came as a traveller from out of town so finding the location was a bit of a problem. I came at night and signs weren't really evident that you were at the restaurant.  Ruth Chris is in the old city hall building if my memory serves me when I walked up. Not sure if it's considered a historical location that can't be tampered with much. But it was great service and a great experience! We had dinner here to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. It did not disappoint the steaks were excellent among the best I have ever tasted and completely filled me up. The truffle crusts on the steak complimented well and the side dishes were just enough. And the classic cheese cake was different but in a very good way! The service and atmosphere in the restaurant was very good\n\nOverall we recommend We hosted a friend's birthday (we're all in our mid-40s, foodies, etc, 8 people who have all worked in restaurants in our prior lives), and we had a very disappointing experience.\n1. The service was not on point - forks/silverware weren't pulled off the table. Drinks took about 20 minutes initially to arrive.\n2. The food was atrocious. I had a rare+ filet with lobster tail, and it honestly had zero flavor whatsoever. Texturally, it was fine, but very disappointing for part of a $500 meal. It's like they forgot the seasoning and gave us bland food.\nB. My partner ordered the cream spinach, lobster mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and potatoes au gratin for the table, and ALLLLL of them were unseasoned with low flavor.\nC. My partner ordered crab cakes, and she was highly disappointed in the limited flavor.\nD. The potatoes au gratin were cubed and boiled with no flavor, low amounts of cheese/sauce.\n\nI had two bottles of wine and had a great time, but the rest of the crew hated their meals, and we spent almost $1500 with the automatic surcharge/tip/taxes.\n\nEvery one of our group has been to Ruth Chris's around the US, and this was our first experience of having a bad time. But, it's an expensive enough bad time to warrant if we'll go ever again.\n\nI also didn't recognize this. I'm a white, middle years dude. My crew a diverse and the majority persons and women of color. We were \"invited\" to come downstairs for dinner.  I've been there a couple of times and never knew there was a basement part of the restaurant.\n\nUpdate: The GM reached out to us, and they were very apologetic. They offered to bring us out to dinner and correct the experience.\n\nWill update with our second visit.  3/18 Swift and friendly service. Cozy atmosphere. Awesome food.\nSteaks are top tier, but I usually opt for the rack of lamb, which is incredible here.\nThe salads are very good too- especially the wedge salad, which comes with tones of thick crispy bacon and plenty of fresh blue cheese.\nDesserts are great too. Got the seasonal citrus tart which was light and not sweet. Nice balance.\nGrill 23 and Moo are the only worth while steak houses in Boston and I look forward to coming here again and again High end statehouse  located in the heart of Beacon Hill and steps away from the State House, I could just go to Mooo for the buttery bread and I would be completely satisfied. Pleasant and attentive staff, large selection of wine, spirits and cocktails. Its a gem for steak lovers. We celebrated a birthday there and was quite impressed of how well the staff made the time special. Will definitely visit again. If you are looking for a nice Steakhouse you have to check out Mooo. We came here for our anniversary and it was perfect! The service was top notch and the food was incredible!\n\nThe bread was absolutely delicious and we had to hold ourselves back from ordering more. The presentations of the oysters was great and they were delicious! It did take a while for our steaks to come out but once they did they were devoured! Absolutely recommend the filet with a side of mashed potatoes.\n\nWe were too full for dessert but they brought us over their chocolate covered marshmallows which was the perfect mini sweet treat.\n\nI highly recommend coming here!! Best steak I\u2019ve ever had but it\u2019s the most expensive steak I\u2019ve had sooo. For the Bananas Foster I am dairy free and they gave me dairy free ice cream on the side that was amazing. And they didn\u2019t charge me any extra for it. Service was absolutely amazing. Mooo... Beacon Hill is a gem for steak lovers looking to celebrate a special occasion. Our anniversary dinner was elevated by not just exceptional food, but truly remarkable service. The roasted bone marrow and prime dry aged porterhouse were expertly prepared, the prime sirloin tartare was in a league of its own. I still dream about it every now and then\u2026 What set this experience apart was how the staff personalized our evening - presenting a custom menu and anniversary dessert. In a city with no shortage of steakhouses, Mooo... stands out for its combination of top-tier culinary skills and attentive, memorable service. Definitely a must-visit for anyone looking to celebrate something special or simply indulge in extraordinary beef. Worst Dunkin, they got the whole order wrong. The bagels weren't toasted. They out the cream cheese on the side. The sweet tea is not sweet. What a mess Ordered an Iced Machiatto. Whatever I got wasn\u2019t even close. An iced macchiato is layered espresso with milk. There was no layering at all so either they \u201cmixed\u201d it like an iced latte or more likely they didn\u2019t put the expresso in  it.  I do not think they even put expresso in it because it was completely white like milk and had zero espresso/coffee taste.  Didn\u2019t bother asking them to remake it because obviously they don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care what a macchiato is \u2026. Sucks because it\u2019s a $7 drink not even made properly .what a waste. Food was good once they got it right. Staff was friendly enough and fixed their mistakes. Nice place, we buy coffee everyday but if we need to use the bathroom we need to buy something \ud83d\ude00.  Amazing. Keed doing this Worst Dunkin donut ever,\nService , slow , there are too many workers but no one helps,  i wait for my coffee 10 minuts they give me the wrong one ,\nI ask as a favor to get the right one , they get mad and it take another 8 minuts to make it , no just me all the other costumers was complaining about wrong items Excellent afternoon tea with a friend today. We had a lovely time and definitely weren't rushed while we savored our full pots of tea. They had vegetarian options and were able to accommodate allergies if needed. Great atmosphere and ambiance. We really enjoyed trying and discussing everything as we went. There was both typical English tea fare and some more unusual or novel flavor pairings. Great experience overall. I really love the option of an entirely gluten free tea house. It was a small and unique store front with very limited seating, you can only get reservations. The bites are petite like a tea house, my only complaint is that I wish there were at least two pieces of each bite for $50 a person.\nI am grateful they accommodate to every allergy and diet preference. The lot of teas have a large variety and all in all I enjoyed the experience. We had a blast at silver dove celebrating my sisters birthday. I think its a little pricey, but the experience is worth it. The bites were delicious. The vegan ones were great. I wish there was more that came with the order. The place is beautiful. A lovely tea experience in the heart of downtown. I have seen this place a ton of times before, but I never went in until a friend invited me. I\u2019m so happy I went! With the seasonal menu and variety of options and care toward people\u2019s dietary restrictions and allergies, this place builds a cozy environment to enjoy a chilly day.\n\nThe scone was warm and buttery and a great start to the afternoon tea set.\n\nFor the savory items, I really liked the bread with carrots on top. There was a savory umami spread under the softened carrots that was bursting with flavor.\nThe soup was a bit gritty but warming. The yellow bread had light curry flavor and great texture. The cucumber sandwich was a bit sad; it was plain and didn\u2019t taste of much.\n\nFor the sweet, my favorite was the Bakewell tart. The jam was delicious and a perfect balance of sweet and tart. The almond part was nutty and smooth.\nThe eclair could and should have had more matcha flavor, but it was just powder on top which meant the roof of your mouth was just matcha. The macaron\u2019s lemon jam was light and refreshing, but I\u2019m not a big fan of poppy seeds. The speculaas cake tasted like carrot cake. The coconut mousse just dissolved in the mouth but didn\u2019t have much coconut richness.\n\nOverall, a tasty, relaxing experience! Spent a wonderful Valentine\u2019s Day weekend having afternoon tea at Silver Dove. The staff are very accommodating of food allergies and I really enjoyed the nut-free desserts while my wife had the traditional options. So many options for tea and I did not regret choosing the Silver Dove Winter Blend, which was like a delicious a spicy chai. We stayed walking distance to this Dunkin\u2019 & one rainy morning, I ventured over for a chai latte. No joke\u2026 once I finished paying for my drink, they had it on the counter all ready for me! I was floored by their quick and courteous service! Thanks (as I said to the baristas)! Excellent Dunkin location, and I've been to a lot of them over the years. Donuts and coffee were wayyyyy better and cheaper than those artisan donuts across Boston. Just get a glazed donut here with coffee and you won\u2019t regret it. Constantly get my order wrong, my order isn\u2019t that complicated so you\u2019d think it would be easy. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Literally the best Dunkin\u2019 I have EVER visited. The team works like a well oiled machine, my coffee was done before I could even walk to the end of the counter. Great coffee. Went there every morning my week in Boston and my coffee was excellent every single time. Well done Crazy fast service! Delicious modern Mexican bowl with steak!\n\nCame back and tried the classic Mexican chicken burrito. I love that they offer broccoli and fajita veggies. And the Gussa sweet and spicy sauce has an impressive kick. Love it! Ordered pickup - staff was very friendly, quick to help and had my order ready sooner than expected. Food was delicious. Place was clean. Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience! SO happy I work right around the corner now! Great place for lunch! Portion size/price was right on the mark. Pictured below is the Original Bowl size. The picture is a little deceiving to look small, but there was a lot of ingredients packed in. I made my own bowl with white meat chicken and to my surprise, there was a lot of chicken in the bowl! Most places similar charge you $3+ for barely noticeable chicken. Definitely a filling meal for under $10 (if you don't add chips + salsa etc.) Very quick service and friendly staff, I ordered ahead online at 11:56 AM and it was ready in the pick up window by 12:02 PM. Will be going back more often! The best, BEST burrito in the city. I drive over an hour every once in a while to come get one. Worth the trip 200%. Super clean, organized, kind and efficient! So delicious and great portion!! Absolutely loved the atmosphere and great service. We shared a crab cake, quahog bake and lobster roll, all were good. It was a warm Sunday evening. We were in the mood for some people watching in Faneuil Hall. This place was the perfect spot.\n\nTon of staple seafood Choices and hearty dishes.\n\nThey also had their own signature Kolsch on tap which was delicious. Only downside is the prices are pretty high, but you are in a touristy area. Great place in Quincy MP for some seafood and drinks. Be aware it is a busty place and you may need to be patient but it is worth the wait. Went here on Labor Day weekend. It was a beautiful day and we sat outside. We were seated quickly considering it was crowded. Meal was delicious had fisherman\u2019s platter, fish and chips and Calamari. Fish was not heavily breaded which made fish taste  good. Definitely got a large portion for fisherman\u2019s platter. Service was okay but again it was extremely busy. We will be back again when we visit Boston. Our server was very nice and patient while we asked all questions and changed our order.\nThe food was really good, bit pricey but we had to get that seafood!! We chose to eat here over the other options locally. And we're happy we did. The food was delicious, savory and had that perfect tavern feel to it. The wait staff were friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic and has decor to match the mood. Our family had an amazing lunch here after our Duck Tour, we were starving when we arrived and the food came out with lightning speed. We sat outside on the patio and our server Estefani was excellent, checking on us the perfect amount to make us feel taken care of without being obtrusive. We had the hot buttered lobster rolls with side salads, clam chowder, truffle fries and chicken fingers from the kids menu. Everything was delicious.  Five stars! Nice spot with outdoor seating. Burger was good and the breakfast sandwich was bigger than expected. It was tasty too. Service while courteous was slow. Be prepared to ask for refills and the server said they didn\u2019t have to-go cups. Food is solid, service is decent, and the bartender is the best. Service is quick but can be a bit clumsy. Overall, everyone enjoyed their food and loved their drinks! There were no tables available on the upper level when we arrived for lunch. The hostess asked the manager if we could be seated downstairs. He then carried our stroller down the stairs and set us up at the perfect table for our family of seven. They also provided coloring pages for our 2 yr old and changed the TV channel to a kids show. Our waiter was excellent and the food was amazing! We will be back for sure! I stopped in for lunch on a Thursday and was very impressed! I had the spicy mole chicken burrito with guacamole. It was probably the best burrito I've had in Boston. The flavors were rich and balanced, and I really loved the taste of the grilled tortilla surrounding it. Their outdoor patio is really nice. I'm always looking for places where I can eat outdoors. I have had friends rave about this place ever since they moved to this location from Beacon Hill, and I'm glad I finally tried it. I will definitely be back! The owner Mrs. King is the nicest, and the food is impeccable. All ingredients taste so fresh and everything is packed with flavor. The black salsa and chicken mole are amazing, the burrito is always grilled perfectly and packed with ingredients. Villa Mexico is a true gem and the best burrito you can get in Boston. I ordered beef quesadilla w sour cream n guacamole side, the tortilla is soft and the beef is tasty, so does my son's beef burrito. I just wish there is some tomato or onion on the side to make the foods taste more complex but overall is good. horrible place with over priced food. Not Mexico not delicious, see pic for \u201c$18 EXTRA MEAT BOWL\u201d\navoid. Food was microwaved in front of me and did not appear to be in a controlled temperature storage - beans were stored in a sour cream plastic container.\n\nUpdating to respond to owner:\nCame it at 2 PM 3/28\nCold food was stored in controlled temperature device (front left from customer perspective)\n\u201cWarm\u201d food was in metal bins or plastic containers on back left table, outside of steam bins - food had to be microwaved. I went here with my sisters and we all thought it was delicious. Everyone got a different meal. We all tried each other's food and couldn't believe how amazing every single dish was! It was super busy the day we went and the service was great. All around amazing. Nice compact spot for great Thai food. Food is priced affordably, service is fast and it\u2019s delicious. Highlights for me are the corn fritters and the chicken satay - great quick lunch or dinner spot! This is a small and cozy restaurant with excellent service that makes you feel very welcomed. The dishes are overall decent, not particularly outstanding, but the quality is consistent. The prices are also very reasonable, making it a good choice for casual dining or simple gatherings. Reasonable prices, Mediocre ambience, friendly service BUT big on flavor is Kala Thai.\nThis is a sister restaurant of Chen yen cookery in Watertown same owners \u2026. not surprised the food is equally good.\n\nGalangal Soup / kee Mao ( my favorite) basil fried rice / penang curry / crispy shrimp rolls everything we tried was amazing except for the chicken wings .. Ordered galangal soup w shrimp, mango salad, kee mao w beef or veg, green curry w chicken, pineapple curry w veg.\nOverall good flavors, not super spicy. Lots of meat for each dish. Would most recommend mango salad, kee mao w beef, and green curry.\nService was friendly and helpful, on top of water refills even during busy spells. I\u2019ve had a lot of burgers in my life, but the Blue Cheeseburger at Gordon Ramsay Burger in Boston completely blew me away. The patty was juicy and perfectly cooked, with that signature Gordon Ramsay sear. But the real star? That bold, creamy blue cheese that hits with just the right amount of tang and richness. It melts into the burger like it was made to be there. Every bite was a perfect balance of savory, sharp, and indulgent. Paired with their crispy fries and a cold drink? Absolute perfection.\nIf you love blue cheese or just want a burger that hits different\u2014this is it. Easily a 5/5. I\u2019ll be back for this one again (and again). The burgers were so good. Well seasoned, tasty, cooked beautifully and I am looking forward to retuning. My boyfriend and I visited with our daughter, it did not disappoint. I got the ABC burger with blooming garlic and he got the Truffle burger with 2 orders of fries(they were small and we like to eat). The fries were bomb as well, I do wish they had a bigger portion size for them. Everything tasted fresh.\n\nThe atmosphere was cool. Service was pretty good. Fantastic food, drinks, and service. All the food is fresh, the burgers are juicy and seasoned well.  We tried a few items and we are looking forward to coming back for more. I do question the sincerity of the bad reviews - there is nothing ghastly or dreadful about this restaurant!! If you want a burger, this is definitely a good spot! Service was very kind, even if it seemed they were a bit understaffed (or at least it took a while for our dishes to be cleared and the check to be given).\nMy family all tried the special burger which had this garlic sauce that was very tasty! Onion rings and fries were great too! Just some advice, if you want a medium-rare burger, try asking for it medium. Mine I ordered medium and it was more medium-rare, but I don't care either way. The elevation of simple ingredients into a culinary explosion of flavors hitting the pallet. It's not just any burger it's a Gordon Ramsey burger complete with truffle French fries. Amazing food!\n\nGreat taste for super healthy food. Love that everything is vegan and plant based. Would recommend! Great smoothie bowl options in Downtown Boston.\n\nI recently took a visit on a Sunday morning to satisfy my craving for acai bowls, and I was pleasantly surprised by what they had to offer. I decided to try the chocolate protein bowl, the acai bowl, and the blue oasis bowl. All three bowls were served in good portions, and considering the quality of the ingredients, the prices were reasonable.\n\nWhile the toppings and flavors of the bowls weren't necessarily groundbreaking or extraordinary, they still provided a delicious and healthy alternative to start the day. The balance of flavors was well-executed, and the fresh ingredients were evident in every bite. I particularly enjoyed the chocolate protein bowl, which stood out with its unique selection of toppings.\n\nIf you're in Downtown Boston and looking for a place to enjoy a delicious and nourishing smoothie bowl, Cocobeet is a solid choice. With good portion sizes, reasonable prices, this place delivers on its promise of providing great healthy alternatives. Apparently the menu does not reflect accurate pricing. The premade smoothies in bottles are $9.95-10.95. It's $13.95 if you order it fresh. No prices in the items in the fridge either that I could see.\n\nI ordered a \"tropical breeze\" smoothie and got something marked \"chocolate protein\" instead but felt bad having them remake it, thinking maybe they misheard so I didn't say anything. My friend then ordered with a different cashier for a \"tropical breeze\" as well but also was handed a \"chocolate protein\" smoothie. I didn't see anything on the menu for this as an item or add on. This place is not as advertised for pricing and the staff didn't seem to understand their own product. The smoothie was good but I wanted a refreshing fruity drink, not a chocolate shake with mystery ingredients.\n\nAlso the smoothie is so thick it breaks the straw to drink. Need sturdier straws or more liquid in the drink. It is an absolute pleasure to write this five star review!! Such an excellent and amazing experience!! I was visiting Boston for a couple of days, I emailed if they can coordinate delivery straight to my hotel and they did! Irem Yalcin helped me place my order and answered all my questions. Such a friendly service that way easy and pleasant!! They made my experience extra special and extra healthy!! :) The juices tasted so fresh!!! Everything was perfect!! Thank you So much for going above and beyond! I truly appreciate it! Friendly staff and fresh juices!! Awesome food! Especially if you are gluten free! My office just moved to about 400 ft away, so I had the chance to eat here for the first time in ages. Not very crowded at all at 1:00 p.m., and my buffalo chicken wrap was excellent. I look forward to future visits! We spent a week visiting Boston recently and this restaurant was amazing!!! For anyone who eats kosher it is a godsend. It's right in the middle of the city, so the location is super convenient, and they have both a dairy section and a meat section. However, even if you do not specifically eat kosher, the food is so good (especially the pulled brisket \ud83d\ude0b) it's worth a visit. Furthermore, the owner and all of the employees were a delight! Highly recommend! A gem in the heart of Boston! Amazing food, I\u2019ve never had anything bad here. Great location, great facility, lots of comfortable seating. Jonathan greeted my party as soon as we walked in and was incredibly helpful. All the other staff were very nice. Would definitely recommend Good pastry selection with both affordable and \u201cfancier\u201d options. I bought an iced latte and 2 GIANT cream cheese danishes for $12, which I consider a win. They also offer breakfast, brunch, and lunch. Coffee, salad, sandwich, pizza, sushi. They have it all. Staff so friendly and helpful! The store is clean and refreshing. Great great prices for kosher food. So many food options. Highly recommend. What a cute coffee shop! I visited during December so the store was trimmed with holiday decor. My husband and I each had a seasonal beverage. I had the nutcracker latte and my husband had the cinnamon roll latte based on the signs at the store. Highly recommend both! If you are in the Boston downtown crossing area this is the perfect place to stop for a good cup of coffee or any other hot or cold drink. Instead of going to one of those big chain coffee shops you can enjoy a great coffee here at the same time do something for our community.  The coffee is really good and the staff are very friendly!! I found this coffee house because I needed somewhere to store my luggage before checking into my hotel, and they will do that using the bounce app! Super cool! While I was there, I got a delicious hot latte and sat to read for a bit! Such a cute place! Pretty good tea selection, nothing to write home about, but super yummy baked treats. Very cute vibe, and liked that they donate money to different charities every month! Great spot to rest while walking all over Boston! Good selection of coffee flavours and breakfast items. Service is quick and  the cafe is spacious and there are lots of tables for groups or solo travellers. Prices are reasonable too. What is happening and who is the brains behind the pastries and desserts here!\n\nThe cheesecake is the best you\u2019ll EVER have!!\n\nThe lox breakfast sandwich is incredible too!\n\nCute spot, friendly team, delicious coffee and treats!\n\nThis review was made in connection with a Toast promotion. The food was good. I ordered the coffee cake and a bacon egg and cheese. The ordering system is a tad messy in my opinion, you come up to the till and you pick what you want like a usual cafe, but there\u2019s so much on the menu that it\u2019s a bit overwhelming. I\u2019d recommend looking at the menu beforehand. They offer you a physical menu at the counter but I felt a tad rushed to read that at the front of the line. My boyfriend ordered an espresso and didn\u2019t have enough time to read that it was a tiny cup (he\u2019s used to Dunkin Donuts\u2019 larger portions) So he was pretty displeased.\ud83d\ude2c All in all, I think I\u2019d need a second trip at a different location. This is a great coffee shop. We ordered the black sesame coffee and caramel latte and both were good. I was really looking forward to trying the black sesame and it was delicious. The almond croissant was delicious and the monkey bread was ok. The place is very nice and clean and has a white subway tile look through the place. This place gets packed and there was a long line and no available seating. The staff was nice and helpful, although busy. Overall, the coffee and pastries were good. I\u2019d give a 4.5, so rounding up. We\u2019ll have to try breakfast another time. Food:  I\u2019ve ordered the pistachio croissant several times, and it is always super delicious.  I rate it as one of the best croissants ever.  The various coffee drinks are also very good.\n\nAtmosphere:  A bright, energizing atmosphere that is a great place to relax or catch up over tasty bakery items and conversation.\n\nService:  Friendly and personable service, always great! We were in Boston and had seen YouTube videos about this place so had to try.\nTatte lived upto our expectations, we ordered Corn & spinach Shakshua, pistachios croissant, pistachio latte and breakfast croissant sandwich all very good.\nWe would 100% recommend this place for quick coffee stop or brunch. Two story interior, with amazing seating on the second level - perfect for connecting with friends while enjoying the views and beating the Boston elements. Starbucks options are endless, coffee \u2615\ufe0f(duh?!?), snacks, a lil more than a snack \ud83d\ude09, desserts, refreshers and SO much more. LOVE this location! good coffee, and nicest starbucks sitting area i\u2019ve seen! Bonus for cute doodle on my cup and having a ton of outlets We have been staying at a hotel near this Starbucks location for a few days. The service is completely inconsistent ranging from very pleasant to completely rude. Surprisingly, the more pleasant experiences came when the store was busy; left without many customers the staff (different personnel than the busy times) seems to forget they are in a service profession.  I think customers have the right to expect basic politeness and civility.  Not always present at this location. Won't be back. I get it that people who patronize Starbucks can be entitled, but don't start your interaction with a customer that way.  Coffee was standard Starbucks, location is good and actually the architecture is interesting. Just the service is so bad as to make this an avoid. Greeted with that classic northern rudeness.\n\nIt\u2019s a Starbucks but the lady working there acted like I walked in her front door. Demanding I make a purchase to use their amenities. Which included sitting down while using google maps to figure out where I was walking to. The store was not heated, quite cold to sit in. Hojicha latte was decent. Avocado bacon stack was fresh. The lady handing out food was very sweet. Starts to get crowded not long after it opened. Ogawa Coffee is a coffee roaster founded in Kyoto. I\u2019ve been looking forward to visit their Boston location for their matcha latte and hojicha late. We arrived when they just opened at 9 on a Saturday but the cafe was already half full.\n\nAfter the taste test, I prefer their hojicha over matcha. I will try their coffee next time as this is what they\u2019re actually known for.\n\n\uff0aHojicha Latte $6.75\nIt is so difficult to find a high-quality hojicha latte in the US. My bf has never had hojicha latte and he described it as a \u201cmelted hojicha ice cream\u201d. As the tea was roasted, it didn\u2019t carry the grassy flavor like matcha. It had an almost cocoa-like deep and intense flavor.\n\n\uff0aMatcha Latte $6.75\nThe matcha latte was good but didn\u2019t really impress me to be honest. Not sure which type of matcha powder did they use. I thought it was ceremonial grade but not the finer or finest one.\n\nJust a note that I saw their barista whisked the matcha and hojicha in a paper cup(?). This whisking method was questionable to me, but I didn\u2019t find any clumps on the bottom of my lattes so perhaps it was fine.\n\n\uff0aBLTE Sandwich $12.50\n\uff0aChive & Cheddar Scone $4.50\nWe tried their breakfast food but it was a miss unfortunately. The BLTE was fresh and delicious, but quite overpriced imo. The chive and cheddar scone tasted bland and stale. I gave up after a few bites. Totally disappointed. Came here on a rainy day because I heard they had great latte art. We ordered two large latte and got pic 1 and 2, which is completely different from what others got (see pic 3). I asked them for an explanation for such drastic difference in service, and the only explanation I got was due to the cup size. As you can see from pic 4, they CAN DEFINITELY make nice latte art in a bigger and taller cup if they want! They did not offer making another one for us and insisted they only make nice latte art for small cup. Will not come again. The coffee here is overpriced for what it is. The beans don\u2019t taste like anything special and there aren\u2019t any unique or creative drinks. The seating concept is cute but it can be uncomfortable when it\u2019s crowded and you just want to sit down in a normal seat. 100% recommend! Went Friday in the afternoon, surprisingly it wasn\u2019t that packed as I expected. Found a seat right away and ordered a BLTE and a hot smoked maple latte (recommended by one of the baristas). The sandwich and latte were sooo good. You can taste the maple and the saltiness of it, it was made perfect. Would definitely be back and bring my computer to study there next time. My first Cafe Nero experience!\n\nI loved the chicken croissant, rest everything else was average. The service was good. But I would rate it 3.5/5 if google had that option.\n\nThey location is the key! I am not sure of stepping in any other Cafe Nero again! I usually love cafe nero, though i wanted a caramel frap my boyfriend ordered ahead of me and got his caramel frap, then when i went to order it was busier and another girl came out from the back, she asked me what i wanted and i told her a caramel frap and she said ok iced caramel latte and i looked at her bc thats not what i asked for and she said i cant blend anything right now and i said ok.. she told me \u201cits the same thing\u201d (no its not) my caramel latte wasnt even mixed Stopped in for a small cold foam cold brew and a breakfast sandwich. $15 before tip. The coffee was fine but the breakfast sandwich was one of the worst I\u2019ve ever had at a coffee shop. Stale and chewy, and much smaller than I expected. Not worth the money at all. We came here to snack on something, and we were very well received.\n\nThe croissant was good!\nNice decor by the way. Horrible and rude staff. For the prices, you'd expect a properly made drink. Dirty tables and overall messy cafe. It has potential with a good location and atmosphere, but it desperately needs better management to turn things around. Regular.\nNo names asked for when ordering=confusion at pickup. No seating.\nNo toilet. The food comes out as you ordered it, and they actually use their toaster ovens (I have been to a Starbucks where you ordered baked goods and they seemed to not toast it). So the food has always been great at this location.\nThe crew here is polite, they\u2019re clean, attentive, and they\u2019re quick!\nThe only thing they\u2019re missing is chairs, but the site is not big enough for that, and it doesn\u2019t need it. However, if there\u2019s an expansion plan, that\u2019s the thing it needs. The food, the people providing the food, and how they handle customers and food are all great. Best location in Boston honestly. The staff here are incredible. I don't know how they keep so calm, cool, and friendly during the morning coffee rush as everyone's stopping by on the way to work! They are always so organized despite the extremely high volume of customers and orders, and I have always had a great experience here! The Starbucks was really cool. Mostly because there was this steaming tea kettle outside. That was part of the previous Tea company that used to be there but it was still really cool to see. We totally had to stop and get coffee since we were already looking. I was a little disappointed to see that there was absolutely nowhere to sit inside just because as tourists we were walking a lot and it would have been really nice to sit while we waited for our coffee instead of having to stand on already sore feet. But the staff was really nice and they were super excited that we were from Colorado and asked us questions about where we were from. The Steaming Kettle is hands down the best Starbucks in the Boston area. The location is perfect right outside the Government Station MBTA. But the best part is the staff. Everyone is friendly and is always happy to see you, even during the morning rush. This place could be the next \"Cheers\". The Caffe Latte was really nice. They offer the regular coffees (pressed, dripped and pour over). The interior of the shop is not so tempting. For me a little too simple and uninspired.\nNo WiFi Super friendly staff to go along with delightful single origin beans. A drip coffee or espresso comes free with a bag of beans. Decor is inspiring, with happy plants and artwork dotting the walls. If you\u2019re looking for a local coffee place, this is it! My husband & I were recently in Boston for almost a week and we enjoyed their coffee everyday except the weekends because disappointingly, they weren\u2019t open. The salted maple latte is delicious as was the pumpkin latte. A friendly space with excellent coffee. Only slight criticism is that it doesn't open on weekends (unlike other nice coffee places nearby) but that doesn't detract from the really lovely atmosphere and delicious coffee at Render. This place is nothing out of the ordinary, it\u2019s quite simple. However, their products are great, they have a great variety and their service is very efficient. I got my order pretty fast and also there is a lot of seating space which is always appreciated. The Caffe Latte was really nice. They offer the regular coffees (pressed, dripped and pour over).

    "reviews": "This place was super cool but I think I made the wrong choices when it comes to picking what I wanted!\n\nI got the famous Boston Cream Pie (wasn\u2019t a fan at all, I don\u2019t like milk chocolate so that one is on me). The cake and the cream were really good aside from chocolate.\n\nI got that little strawberry because it looked cute, I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say it tasted like medicine! It was super strong in flavor and not a good one.\n\nI walked by the place twice and saw really long lines both days, without having any background about what it is. I simply just wanted to try it but it wasn\u2019t what I was looking for.\n\nThere is waiting for sure if you wanna buy something, but the line goes by so fast because they got a couple employees working. This is a CASH only spot, I had to go to an ATM across the street to get some cash.\n\nI still recommend trying this place out, maybe choose better options and leave a better review:) Decadent cannolies that are a bit pricey, but worth it to try. We stopped while doing the freedom trail. It was a Tuesday night so the line wasn't too long. Had the original, pistachio, and amaretto. The ameretto was amazing with the chocolate coating. Would recommend the place for a treat. Maybe don't go here everyday or you may get harpooned in the harbor... Bakery store for to go, as no seating area. Staff are friendly and service is fast. They have many options including cakes. We only tried cannoli with ricotta cheese, that tastes very good. Assuming other products tastes very good as well! Prices are a little on high end. They only take cash. Tried 2 cannolis and a slice of their Boston Cr\u00e8me pie. The cannolis were over the top good. Flavor, texture and structure were awesome. Still want more after it\u2019s gone good. Too bad it\u2019s cash only. Limited my sample size. :( Mike\u2019s Pastry - Hanover Street.\n\nYou know you\u2019re close because you start seeing people carrying little white boxes with blue ink lettering \u201cMike\u2019s Pastry\u201d.\n\nEventually you arrive wondering why is this place so popular. Once you step in and browse the glass cases it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\nSo many choices, but you can\u2019t eat all. You must pace yourself.\n\nIn any event the pastries are delicious some better than others but that\u2019s strictly a personal choice.\n\nAlways seems busy. Priority is to get you in and order. Not much organization for ordering but , eventually it happens.\n\nGreat place to snack on a dessert anytime.\n\nA whole pastry or single portion available.\n\nThe pastry chefs do it right at Mike\u2019s Pastry. Even on Christmas Day!\n\nCash only!\n\n4.5\u2b50\ufe0f Cash only!\n\nThis review is for the Boston cream pie cupcake. It is an absolute dream. I had it once 3 years ago and never forgot it. I came to Boston for work again for 48 hours and getting this cupcake again was my top priority. It\u2019s even better than I remembered. It\u2019s heaven. The softest, creamiest cake and pastry filling with the most decadent ganache topping. Not too sweet. Tastes amazing slightly chilled. I should have bought 4 instead of just 1. Try it!!!\n\nEdit: I came back the next day and ordered 3 more. Modern Pastry Shop.  Lots of wonderful desserts, and sweets.  Walk in and you step into the dessert dimension where you will be tantalized by many different desserts.  Choose carefully. And then be transported to dessert bliss. Since 1935.\n\nSometimes a line extending outside but this moves quickly.\n\nCash only! This is an amazing pastry shop and definitely one you need to visit while visiting Boston!  They have nearly every popular (and many interesting & unique too) pastries as well as coffees/espressos, and great service too!\n\nWe waited in line to get inside, but once in there, we were able to find seating for a large group of 7!  We then had table service take care of us and their service was excellent!  Loved their many appetizing looking desserts in the cases!  It was hard to choose!\n\nBut what we all ordered were great!  We enjoyed them and would definitely return! Part of walk through Italian quarter en route to Paul Revere\u2019s statue. This has seating and table service. Delightful Canoli. Go the smaller size.\n\nOnly pain point was the only cash terms, not mentioned anywhere in store or on menus etc. not ideal for tourists like me, had to go to bank ATM across street to pay. Definitely a sweet experience to try. Dare I say\u2026 I enjoyed the cookies more than the cannoli!? So many delicious looking choices it was hard to pick. The line wasn\u2019t too bad either. Hard to hear the cashier. There is a separate dine-in line if you can find an open spot. Cute little souvenir shop in the Faneuil Hall Marketplace. In my opinion you have the best chance of finding a souvenir you like in this shop over the others scattered around the city or in the airport. They\u2019re a 2 floored souvenir store with a wide range of souvenirs and Knick Knacks. I really appreciated the large variety of merchandise at Best of Boston.  It's a 2-story shop located in the northern row of shops in Faneuil Hall.  They carry everything from college stuff, sports team stuff, food items, and even a large selection of plush toys.  As others have mentioned, prices are slightly higher than other cart vendors located within the main hall, but at least the credit card machine doesn't mysteriously \"break\" as you pull out your wallet.  I was able to easily pick up swags for all the people back home that represented Boston well.  The people working in the shop were quite friendly and helpful. Cute little shop. Just wish they had more options. Was looking forward to finding a couple of more souvenirs considering this store has two levels. The souvenirs sold could be a bit more pleasing to the eye. This place is so good, Manager is so good! There're a lot of goods! We bought a lot of souvenir at there. Just enjoy it! Nice little gift shop with a pretty good selection. Beautiful Here ! Feels Very Authentic and Warm. Glad to Have Stopped In! Very Large Selection To Choose From!\n\nBrand New Arrivals At The Front Counter !\n\nBrett , Nick, And The Team Are Very,\n\n~ Friendly & Respectful They have a liquor that is very hard for me to find. I come from the Mid Hudson Valley,N.Y. and when I visit Boston (not as often as I like) my tradition is to stop in to buy several bottles of Punch Abruzzo. I always have a pleasant conversation with two people (who I believe are a couple). I share stories and always learn something new and exciting. Thank you! Paul Super friendly and knowledgeable staff in the cutest shop. They sell a huge variety of wines, some mixers, and a few other items like chocolates. A must if you like wine and supporting small business. Salute! Received my delicious wine today, I\u2019m thankful and will be your best customer! I LOVE THIS PLACE!! The owner is very nice and personable to all his customers. Every time I visit Boston I stop here. I get the chance to experience and learn something new every time. The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable. You don\u2019t feel rushed at all like some places make you feel. The store is stocked with a huge selection and the quality of the products are amazing. They even ship to ya! People in Maryland love you guys! Keep up the good work and I\u2019ll visit again soon. Seriously, the BEST way to see Boston.  Great bikes and kit, great route and above all; exceptional service from these guys! Thanks to the Boss Andrew, Wade and Darryl for an excellent tour. My wife and I recently visited Boston and wanted to tour the city via a bicycle. We searched the web and found Urban AdvenTours. The tours they offered fit our schedule and were reasonably priced. We registered online and followed the instructions for arriving on time. On our arrival we were issued a helmet and a bicycle that fit our individual needs for a safe adventure. Our tour Guide was Austin and he did a wonderful job describing the different aspects of the city during our journey. We had an excellent time viewing Bostons different neighborhoods and areas. At no time did we feel unsafe or uncomfortable.\nWe would highly recommend this adventure if you have the time and opportunity.\nThanks Austin! We had a great tour with our guide, Gary. Gary was super knowledgeable and fun to share the morning with. He took us through the most iconic neighborhoods and park areas of Boston. It was the perfect way to see the city. I would highly recommend it. Gary was a great tour guide, very knowledgeable about Boston history and the area. Kept us moving at a good clip, kept us safe and sound. I would highly recommend. This is a great tour and very well managed and organised. Our two guides Charles and Bob were excellent. Plan I. Doing some of their other tours next time I\u2019m in Boston. Highly recommended Horrible customer service. I called costumer service about reprinting my card and they said they couldn\u2019t do anything which was totally different to what the customer service person told me therefore going against headquarter orders. I offered to give them my social number as that is a way of identification and they said they couldn\u2019t when under federal law the social security number is a form of identification. I went to Another citizens down the street and they immediately printed my card after I gave them my social. I told them what happened and they told me they would report the location since they are not allowed to do that. Horrible experience I would recommend to everyone not to go there as they did not do their job and rushed me out. Last year I went to this bank to change my last name because I get married and I wanted my account to have my new name. So I want there and the guy after 15 minutes helped me he struggle so much to do the change I don\u2019t know he was manager or supervisor he was in one of those offices. I asked him in the end when you will send me new card with my new information he said you don\u2019t need it I said are you sure he said yes. And here we are after a year receiving my new card with my old information I don\u2019t know this people what they doing if they don\u2019t know how they can say I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know and all set losing my time in this place. If I could give this branch 0 stars I would. Had an appointment today at 12:30. Got to the branch at 12:29 and to my surprise there was a sign out front saying the branch was closed until 2pm. No one bothered to call me to let me know beforehand nor to reschedule to a different date. Waste my lunch break for nothing. I tried giving Citizens multiple chances even though they keep screwing me over in new and creative ways. This is the worst customer service I have ever received from a bank. I will be switching asap. The branch manager Jenny C it's not helpful at all... that's unless, of course, if it's something that can benefit her like opening a new bank account but when her customers need assistance with something else... nope! Jenny is not there for you. I can count more than one occasion that I went there for help and just wasted my time.  Also, their customer service in the bank it's more than mediocre. I pretty much got hanged up on every time I call. The branch is ugly and small and I WILL BE TAKING MY BUSINESS SOMEWHERE ELSE. Jenny C almost made me consider changing banks completely! That's how terrible her service is.  Thank you for nothing JENNY!!! They are rude and unhelpful and I would NOT recommend going here at all! The worst Citizens experience I\u2019ve EVER had! This place is awesome! Great authentic Italian vibes and worth a stop to grab some meat and cheese for a picnic. Salumeria Italiana was recommended for the sandwiches by my brother-in-law. It is a tiny Italian cured meat and cheese shop and market with a little deli counter in the back corner to order sandwiches. We had the La Donna sammie -- it was HUGE and priced right for a great value; we shared it and it was more than enough food for two. The meat and balsamic on it were delicious! It was a little bread heavy as far as ratio of bread to filling, but I'm not mad about it. The staff were all very friendly and patient with customers who didn't know what they wanted to order. We also tried an olive salad from the deli and it was delicious as well! This is the best place to get a sandwich in the north end! Everyone there is so friendly and the food is to die for! I got their fresh pasta while I was in there as well, and now I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll go back to eating any other! I got the La Donna and I could eat it a million times over; everything was so fresh and you could tell the care that goes into the shop! 10/10 recommend! Scam alert. Many of the items in the store are very old and re-sold. I grabbed a simple can of lentils for New Year\u2019s Eve (a tradition all across Italy which nobody in the North End seemed aware of) and they EXPIRED in 2016! The can was covered in rust and dust. After being told I needed to spend more money to pay with a card, I grabbed their extremely overpriced bag of Mulino Bianco cookies (mass produced cookies) and the packaging is totally meddled with\u2014these have been repacked and relabeled and it has nothing to do with the export labeling\u2014but something more questionable. It\u2019s sealed hastily and the bag looks unevenly cut with scissors. What\u2019s more, some woman was leading a \u201cfood tour\u201d creating such congestion in the shop and spewing all sorts of false and fear-mongering information about olive oil, while standing in front of it and preventing anyone from purchasing it. Sadly, you can\u2019t trust most places in the north end. The restaurants have little to no resemblance to any restaurant in Italy. The names of dishes, ingredients, and even towns and cities in Italy are consistently misrepresented. This is why people end up at Eataly. Keep treating people like idiots and they won\u2019t come back. Ciao for now. Disappointed. They were closing in half an hour but I just couldn't resist, as an Italian from Italy, to stop by the best grocery shop in little Italy!\n\nAnd I wasn't disappointed, I felt right at home with all the Italian special dishes such as my dear \"Taralli Pugliesi\" from my own town back at home or the \"mozzarella di bufala\", wanting to have a delicious side meal for my dinner later on.\n\nMy breakfast will also be saved tomorrow thanks to the Venchi chocolate to put on my bread!\n\nDon't get me started on the way one of the guys from the shop started welcoming us in the most Italian welcoming way imaginable, so lovable and iconic!\n\nAll and all a very special time to recommend to everybody visiting the North end for the first time! Classic Italian gourmet shop. The smell is amazing. I won\u2019t comment on the staff because honestly the tourists that come in there are not the friendliest. As for as the food, it\u2019s incredible. The imports are bit pricey but the sandwiches are very great price for the quality and the taste. The Italian bread is fantastic. I highly recommend. This is the best store ever to buy wines. There are a lot of wines from different countries of the world. You can also participate in the wine tasting opening for everyone who wants to taste the best wines of Boston City. You will find dry red wine, white wines, and red wine made by different grapes such as cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and others. I really recommend The Wine Botega. I recently organized a wine tasting for my wife's 40th birthday and had an awesome experience. Everything from the process of scheduling and organizing to the actual event was top notch. Everybody we interacted with was great to work with. This was easily the best wine tasting I've been to. The setting is fun and intimate for a small group (we had 6 in our party). Lastly, the wine itself was absolutely outstanding. I gave some light guidance on preferences and they did the rest. Everybody in my group couldn't say enough good things about the quality of the wines that we got to taste (and ultimately purchased). Great wine store that specializes in bio dynamic wines. Super helpful staff help you navigate their selection of a lot of small producers. Good selection under 20 and some great finds you're not going to run across elsewhere in the 20-35 range. I worked in natural wine for several years and I was stunned by the selection at this wine shop. I am so glad this is in our neighborhood! This is the cutest wine shop we drive a good distance to enjoy the selection of you fantastic wines and the knowledge of the regions never disappoints you have to try it the basement selection is outstanding A friend suggested that I try this place. My son and I went in and ordered a thick cut Delmonico steak. They custom cut the size for us right in front of us and did all the trimming. The steak was great! Love this place.  Old school butcher, exceptional meat quality. Great antidote to Whole Foods.  Not inexpensive, but well worth it. The best butcher in town. I travel from Portland Maine to buy the sausages and veal. Porchetta is amazing as well. Old school butcher who actually tenderizes the meat for you. I Love it here. A Great place to make money (or the opposite), my partner said. Customers are standing  in the store - appeared to wait in line, but, the 2 employees did not have any meat to work with. just standing around, too. How so? \ud83d\ude01\n\nNo MEAT or any refrigerators, It appeared they were waiting for the white door to open to enter. No city, town or hamlet is worth visiting without a premier butcher and baker.\nFrank Susi provides Prime meats and poultry to many of our city's top restaurants. The professional and gracious service is an added bonus to a crown roast, steak or fresh cut braciole that ensures a memorable meal for your family and guests! It's a good Italian restaurant in the heart of the Italian district. All of the dishes are great. We got calamari, baby octopus, pizza, 3 types of fish, etc. - ll tasty and well cooked.\n\nYou must book a table, and it's a trendy place. The only downside is the space you have, as it's really table to table. It's just close to being cautious but not claustrophobic. Even though it's a tiny place, it's flawlessly awesome! The service is amazingly fast, and the servers are kind. I highly recommend their pistachio mortadella pizza and espresso martini! My husband loves their steak as well. We recently tried the zucchini flowers. It was not made like it was in my country. We fill it with rice. This one was filled with ricotta cheese, I guess. However, it was scrumptious! I found it a bit pricey for a side-dish though. I know how hard it is to make them, so I understand. To wrap up, this is one of the best Italian restaurants in North End! Love love love!!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c Date night. Nice small quaint restaurant in the North End of Boston. Clean, comfortable seating. Lighting is a on the darker side but enough lighting to see your food. Greeted by maitre d and seated. Excellent service from Donnie our waiter. Professional, friendly, courteous and attentive. Ordered the zucchini flowers for appetizer and monkfish Milanese and chicken parm for entrees. All prepared, cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend. Will definitely return to try the other items on the menu. MUST try restaurant in Boston! They have really good and fresh made pesto. We tried their mortadella and pistachio pizza it was AMAZING!! And their Risotto del Giorno and it was really good. Great service as well and the staff speaks Spanish! Very average pizza here. I would definitely look elsewhere to find better options because it was just okay. Sauce was good and so was the crust, but the prosciutto and cheese just weren\u2019t that flavorful or explosive in my mouth. Pizzas were a decent size, but I was definitely disappointed in the caesar salad. 2 croutons is kinda ridiculous in my opinion. What a place!  We stopped in while walking the North End, had a fantastic meal, great wine, and got to chat with the chef, Marisa Iocco. We had a delightful lunch of individual real Italian pizzas.  The dough was thin, ingredients fresh, service good and attentive.  Wine list adequate.  Nice street view with plenty local color.  Complimentary bread to dip in seasoned oil was a nice touch. I've only been here once and I must say, the food is awesomely good! We came here late at night, so not quite sure how it is during the day. I'd imagine it's probably crazy busy and packed. It looks like you may have to share a table with strangers on days it's really busy. Luckily, we went late at night so there was plenty of seating. It's a VEGAN restaurant and I believe all of their vegetables used within their dishes are organically grown by ownership. We will definitely be coming back again . Staff seems nice as well. Wow, this might be the most disappointing experience I've had. First off, my girlfriend and are vegan and asked for the vegan menu, yet we were served butter. We specified we were both vegan, a little butter won't kill me, but  I'll pray for anyone with a nut or seafood allergy. We went for lunch and the vegan menu was meant for dinner (and extremely overpriced, considering the quality of our food).  The food was not terrible just extremely overpriced (we did send back the \"vegan\" dish that had butter, and they did replace it with a vegan one, and it's honestly worth wondering if they simply washed it off the butter and added garlic and oil). This was a perfect wedding anniversary dinner.  The service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was authentic.  The chef here really knows what she wants the guest to experience and she makes it happen. Worst restaurant on the north end. Food was completely inedible. Had a foul smell to the plate. My partner and I plates both were very terrible. Smelled bitter and as if it was reheated left overs. Left immediately once food arrived. Did not bother with anything else on the menu. Walked past the kitchen to get to the bathroom and it looked very dirty and the chefs looked very unprofessional. Wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to my worse enemy. So disappointing. I did not know that the food came with two sides I also didn't know that the pasta was separate from the actual dish. The menu only says pasta and the main dish. I would not have ordered a salad and I would have let them know I was allergic. They need to rethink their menu. The service was actually terrible. The bread was also very hard not worth the money at all. Was looking for a really great place that wasn\u2019t overexposed or crowded and found it here. Food was really good and Tony took great care of me. Would come back in a heartbeat and do not pass on the veal pizzaiola with the spicy marinara! Ordered one of the night specials with fra diavlo sauce, but the sauce tasted funny. It had an unpleasant aftertaste. The flavor overall was mid at best. Total of two different dishes ordered - doubt I\u2019ll be coming back. I loved everything about this restaurant! The food was amazing and plentiful, and the atmosphere was charming and inviting, as were all the staff. There were six of us, and we all ordered different food and tried each other. Everything was great! I\u2019ve been a fan of the North End for 25 years. This was our first experience dining at Bricco. We enjoyed a wonderful evening of superb service from Alexa. Her wine and food suggestions were excellent. Our entrees were the Fettuccine Carbonara and 7-Spice Brick Chicken, both absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is North End cozy. Definitely worth a return visit. Our family visited the North End for spring break and had the pleasure of dining at Bricco last Saturday evening. The food, ambiance, wine, cocktails and desserts were absolutely delicious! However, the best part of our evening was definitely the exceptional service we received from our server, Wolmar! From start to finish we were wowed by his food and drink recommendations, personal attentiveness, fantastic personality and overall superior service. What a gem! He made our experience at Bricco unforgettable and because of him, we will definitely be back! Thank you, Wolmar for treating our family like your family! It's one of the best Italian restaurants I have eaten at! The food and the drinks were amazing. Our party of 8 had two favorite drinks at the table were the espresso martini and the hot and dirty martini. We ordered zucchini flowers for our appetizer, and they were definitely worth it. It is small  so space is tight but not too bad. One thing I wish I knew before hand, they have valet parking, cash only, but it is easier and closer than the lot we parked in. Definitely worth going if you have never been. We came in a few weeks ago and had a great night. The octopus was especially excellent, our server Wolmar brought me great wines and the atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for on a date night out. We never felt rushed despite a very full restaurant and capped it off with a 10/10 expresso martini! My husband and I were here 3/21 after our wedding and Wolmar was so incredible he saved my night!!!! The wine he recommended was amazing, and when the first pasta dish I ordered, the pappardelle, wasn\u2019t cooked (if it was al dente that would have been one thing, but it just wasn\u2019t cooked), he got me something else from the kitchen!! Some sort of ravioli, it was delicious. My husband\u2019s short rib was incredible, and Wolmar brought us out a lovely dessert platter too with \u201ccongratulations\u201d written in chocolate :) love love love despite the wobble with the first dish, we\u2019ll be back for Wolmar and his wine!!!! This Italian spot in North End of Boston was amazing.  Friend of mine got a tip that it fills up pretty fast so we should get there as soon as it opened.  Glad we did!  Soon as they opened, they were at 90% capacity and didn't take long to fill up.  We ordered the Spicy Shrimp as an appetizer, and then Bolognese and the Chicken Parm for our main entrees.   This restaurant may be small in size, but in flavor....   I was floored. Best Italian I have ever had.  I would recommend this spot to anyone and everyone!!  I will definitely be coming back! Carmelina\u2019s is an absolute standout in Boston\u2019s North End! From the moment we walked in, the service was beyond exceptional\u2014warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. The staff made us feel like family, offering great recommendations and ensuring we had a fantastic dining experience.\n\nThe food was delicious, with fresh ingredients and bold flavors that truly elevated classic Italian dishes. Every bite was a delight, and the cozy yet lively atmosphere made it even better.\n\nWhile the food was great, it was the spectacular service that made this meal unforgettable. If you\u2019re looking for an amazing dining experience with top-tier hospitality, Carmelina\u2019s is the place to be! Can\u2019t wait to return! So much fun sitting at the counter watching these guys create meals. We thoroughly enjoyed our Italian food well within the North End of Boston. We shared a couple entrees and salads. Bread service was nice too. Rollati was over the top delicious, and the Lobster Ravioli was good too. Beet Salad along with the different style of Caprese Salad you have to try. Overall an outstanding experience, several restaurants to explore in the area, glad we were able to get a table right at opening on Sunday without a reservation. Awesome experience at Carmelina. The food was just superb, I myself ate the wild mushroom penne in which I would recommend to anyone who likes mushrooms and creamy pasta. Though if you don\u2019t like mushrooms my companions got items which they all liked a lot. Another thing to add is how nice and friendly the workers are. We were greeted with a big hello and great service throughout the whole experience. Thus I would highly recommend this restaurant to people who are in the Italian food mood-ML Quaint setting with huge portions of fresh pasta. We enjoyed all of our dishes and left stuffed. Service was excellent and a team atmosphere. We arrived around 4pm to an empty restaurant . At first glance we saw the sign that was certainly a relic and almost gave us second thoughts . We were greeted by a very personable Hostess/ waitress and she seated us immediately right in the small front window area that contains two small tables. Let the people watching begin!\n\nWe ordered a  Couple of delicious Moretti Lager beers and were served ice water and bread along with freshly grated cheese and olive oil , both family style. The bread was crusty with a soft almost sour dough interior and the olive oil was just amazing! A beautiful imported extra virgin oil with a dense appearance and that  beautiful first cold pressed color . The grated cheese was fresh too! Perhaps a Parmigiano Reggiano but I forgot to ask- no need to ask for cheese ever  it is amply supplied for the table.\n\nWe started with fried calamari . This was the best fried calamari we had ever eaten. A Simple light coating and fried perfectly tender in fresh oil .  The tomato sauce on the side was balanced and not overpowering . I also tried the olive oil and lemon  which took the pristine calamari to another level of greatness.\n\nFor entrees we ordered the Veal Parmigiana and the Spaghetti with white clam sauce . Both entrees were excellent! The veal is fork tender and the clam sauce was surreal account my wife , a self proclaimed clam sauce expert.  Dipping bread in the fresh clam sauce also prolonged the enjoyment.\n\nOverall , Saraceno is a classic old school Italian restaurant that sticks with the basics done well. Service is great , the owner is an authentic old school hard working hands on presence in the restaurant too!\nWe will be back asap many times. As we got ready to leave the crowds descended upon Saraceno , obviously a well known dinner spot. Newly renovated, what was Bela Vista Ristorante before. We were walking around looking for a different place to dine and were attracted by the modern look, with colorful LED lighting and bright decor. Looks like they decided to break the mold from the dim, dark typical North End decor. Service was great, food was excellent, and the prices are average for North End restaurants. In from Galveston TX. Our 4th visit in the last year. Great service and food was awesome. Frank (owner) came over to say hello and check on us several times. Food was great. Very busy and they had to turn away customers so make a reservation ahead of time. You don't want to miss this place! What an incredibly disappointing evening at this restaurant from start to finish. I\u2019ll address food, service, and atmosphere as their own points.\n\nFood: The prosciutto with melon appetizer was good, but they could have cut more of the rind off and also given us more prosciutto. The bread basket was boring and they could have given us olive oil. For entrees, my bolognese and my dad\u2019s veal were just good. The texture of the pasta in the bolognese was quite good, but I\u2019ve had much better bolognese in the past. My mom\u2019s pasta with clams was decent but could have used more garlic and seasoning. The worst dish was my sister\u2019s \u201crisotto with mushrooms\u201d which was truly abhorrent. The mushrooms were bland, we couldn\u2019t taste any cheese, and it didn\u2019t taste or look like risotto! It was rice. I could\u2019ve made better at home and we sent it back.\n\nService: It took forever for us to receive our food. There was clearly an issue with the kitchen or our server forgot to put our orders in, but it was a long wait. They also forgot to give us some silverware as we had to switch tables. At least they comped the \u201crisotto\u201d dish we didn\u2019t eat.\n\nAtmosphere: Extremely cramped and small restaurant. At our first table, I was getting dripped on by water from the A/C so we moved. They didn\u2019t even apologize or seem to feel that bad about the water. It was a bit humid too, and the servers were hitting me every time they walked by due to the lack of space.\n\nTLDR; not looking to come back anytime soon. There are other places in the North End with better food, friendlier service with shorter wait periods, and more space to provide a comfortable and relaxed experience. My family has been going here for years. I finally had to leave a review because the food was just so amazing this time. I tried the spaghetti all amatriciana for the first time and it was SO delicious. Ambience is always nice too A very laidback establishment run by a family. The food was not great. We paid $20-22 for pasta that was not worth that. The chicken in the dish was well seasoned, but the Alfredo sauce had a very odd flavor to it. We also had the cheese ravioli and the filling had a consistency of paste. We went in completely by chance. We wanted cheese, grilled chicken and veggie pizza. It was delicious. We especially liked the pizza bread. It was definitely like our mother's handmade bread. Their pizzas are also unique and delicious. The atmosphere is not bad, it is a real family restaurant. We had a great time, the food was great. It\u2019s a family restaurant that makes you feel welcome. Awesome \ud83d\udc4d I should have read the reviews. They are true and accurate. Incredibly poor service. And the food was awful. Do not go here. As an example, I ordered bruschetta. Here is what they brought me. Take my advice and eat somewhere else!! Italian family owned restaurant for over one-hundred years. If you want to experience the old school mom and pop Italian and the true authentic people and food of the north end, this is the place. You might learn a little history about the north end if you talk to the owners. (She might be the Elder sitting in the corner totaling the tickets and handling the money).  Spaghetti with meatballs and garlic bread was very close to my home cooked comfort food. They even have wine and liquor. Also- If the business is in a classic old brick building and there is still neon biz signage outside, you know it's the real deal. Packed-in restaurant, very family-style and classic old North End style. Portions are huge and everyone has to order a dish so prepare for leftovers! Honestly one of the cheaper pasta places in the area which I appreciate, but found the flavors of the tomato sauce to be lacking. Pasta is great though, amazing texture, just needs more spice, overall solid place for dinner! We choose this restaurant solely by walking around , exploring Boston, and we were not disappointed! They have 5 different home made pasta, the dish was good size, finished next day and still yummy. Anett our server had great recommendations and she was top notch! My daughter had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and me the veal Marsala. I like how simple this place is, I had the quattro formaggio and a sangria. Pretty good, a little salty but I was content with the quality of the home made pasta. I could maybe use a little more basil but this definitely satiated my craving. My waiter, Patrick was very helpful and kind. If you want the charm of old school Italian-American that is no frills and feels like a cozy hole-in-the-wall, Al Dente is where it's at.\n\nThe atmosphere is so intimate with its low lighting and they treat guests like family. The pasta definitely tastes house made. The highlight is definitely the quality of their Marinara sauce that is mellow, buttery and not astringent whatsoever.\n\nIs it the best of the North End? Taste wise, it's very traditional and classic. No pizzaz, just good 'ol fashioned warm hug from your nonna kind of Italian. Which, is not a bad thing! But if you want something new, fresh, and enticing, this isn't for you. This is more of comfort food in the most sincere of ways. Very homemade and bright. Delicious! You MUST go to Al Dente for dinner! Start by saying hi to Michael at the door, and then you are required to order the pumpkin ravioli! We were blown away with the entire experience from start to finish, I can\u2019t wait to go back! I can't say enough about the incredible experience we had at Mamma Maria's! We hosted an event, and every detail was absolutely perfect. From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel like VIPs \u2013 their hospitality was truly top-notch. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, setting the perfect tone for our event.\n\nAnd the food? Absolutely delicious. Every dish was thoughtfully prepared and full of flavor. Huge thank you to the staff for being so accommodating and ensuring everything ran smoothly. If you're looking for an incredible dining experience with amazing service and atmosphere, Mama Maria is the place!! Fantastic authentic Italian restaurant at the North End. Among the best in the area if not whole of Boston. We tried the Lobster Agnolotti, Rabbit and Angry pasta which were all delicious. Very fresh and well done pasta. All meat were real fresh and pleasantly surprised with the richness of the pasta. Nice drinks menu with good selection of Italian wines and European beer. Tiramisu was really good too.  The ambience is really nice and set over multiple levels with plenty of  seating. The was amazing!!! The chef, Geraldo is espetacular!! We enjoyed each bite of our food.in addition the wine selection is great!!  The staff were friendly and polite!! It was my birthday and I definitely could not be in a better place for an authentic and delicious Italian food. Thank you I really recommended !! Beautiful Italian restaurant for a nice dinner! I got the lobster ravioli, and the rabbit pasta. Both these dishes were spectacular, however there were still some unspectacular things about them, though. The lobster ravioli was delicious, I loved the lobster meat inside the ravioli, the flavours were there, the sauces were delicious. Unfortunately, the pasta of the ravioli wasn\u2019t cooked to perfection, the edges of the ravioli were slightly hard and undercooked. Secondly, the rabbit pasta was amazing because of the sauce, which was absolutely delicious on the other hand. The rabbit meat was unspectacular, it was bland and didn\u2019t have much substance. I got Wagyu meatballs as an appetizer, and I would probably choose something else next time because it wasn\u2019t mind blowing. The Wagyu meat didn\u2019t really taste like Wagyu, it tasted like regular Ground beef shaped into a ball. What made it flavourful was the tomato sauce on top, not the beef. So it wasn\u2019t that delicious. However, I do have to say the overall meal was still very good, but given the high price and the rest of the great reviews of this place, I would\u2019ve expected it to be better and everything to be spectacular. In reality, it\u2019s a very nice restaurant, but it\u2019s not perfect. I probably would come here again on a special occasion, but I wouldn\u2019t order the same things. They have the most amazing nut-free pesto with their bread. It is SO good. Their truffle carpaccio is unbelievably good I could eat 10 plates of that. The staff is really nice and very very helpful. Incredible experience and worth the hour wait to get in!\n\nFresh oysters and little neck clams are a must.\n\nFor an entree, I ordered the Rockport mackerel and it was delicious.\n\nGreat cocktail and wine selection.\n\nServer was hospitable and attentive.\n\nI was told to either go to Neptune or Union Oyster House during my stay. Having tried them both, Neptune is 10x better. My family and I visited Neptune Oyster for lunch because it was recommended to us by a friend. There was a line of people waiting to get in, but we got inside after waiting about 10-minutes in line.  The inside space is small and cramped. They do have good food overall, but the staff / waitresses that work there are kind of rude. They will boss you around, talk over you and act like our patronage doesn't matter to them. When we first arrived, I asked if they had an estimate of how long the wait time was, and the lady managing the lines ignored my question and told me to go wait in line like some military sergeant talking to a corporal lol..talk about first impressions. It seems like the service people there have become too arrogant by the restaurant's popularity or they are too stressed to care about the customer experience or both!\n\nIn any case, we liked the food so we left them a 22% tip, but the waitress serving us looked pissed off. It's so sad to see a nice restaurant operated by such terrible service staff. I won't be coming back to this restaurant. It's really not that good enough to deal with arrogant and rude service. After reading countless glowing reviews, I decided to give this restaurant a try. I was ready for a wait, but luckily, I was seated right away. The food truly lived up to the hype. Each type of oyster I sampled was incredible, and the lobster roll was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. The scallops were a surprising highlight\u2014served as a full-blown main course paired with delicious vegetables, they were definitely the star of the meal. The wine selection was also fantastic. I\u2019ll definitely make it a point to return whenever I\u2019m in town. The food was pretty good, but maybe not worth the wait on a Monday night and hype? It was pretty busy and seats are close together so sitting next to others are required! It was fun trying the oysters and clams. Octopus was pretty good, in the top of best I\u2019ve had, but some pieces were burnt. The mussels came out last, and they were decent. The fries\u2026 a good 10/10. The star of the show was the lobster spaghettini. So. Much. Lobster. First day in Boston, MA we had to visit what we've researched to be the best seafood/clam chowder restaurant in the entire city. With no reservation, we luckily were able to sit right in front of the front doors. This is a small restaurant, definitely a tight squeeze. You'll most likely sit shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you.\n\nStarting off with a handful of oysters chosen from a list. I loved the fact they all had descriptions which helped with my choices. They were all fresh and described perfectly. A great start.\n\nAlso, the Crudo section caught my eye and opting in for the scallop option. This was mind-blowing. Fresh scallops, beautifully seasoned and bursting with flavour without drowning out the natural taste of raw oysters. Incredible.\n\nFor mains, I ordered the scallops. These not only looked visually stunning, but the flavours worked perfectly together. Tender, fresh and perfectly cooked.\n\nAlmost leaving, I suddenly recalled one the reasons I stopped by. To try what's regarded to be the best clam chowder. Upon the first mouthful, I immediately noticed the consistency. A bit watery but in terms of flavour, not bad. I loved the big chunks of clams which made the chowder one of the best I've had. I was just expecting a thicker broth.\n\nOverall, a great restaurant and a definite stop for anyone visiting or living in Boston. The tight squeeze was 100% worth it. I'll definitely stop by once again the next time I'm in the area. We had a great time at Parla. Requested a nice table when making a reservation, and were pleasantly surprised that the best table in the place was waiting for us when we arrived\u2013right by the window with the best views. Their dungeon master list is a lot of fun if you are feeling adventurous and are ok with the dice making the cocktail decisions. However, be prepared to receive drinks you may not enjoy as much. If you are particular with your drinks, I recommend ordering something from the menu (or something you want off the menu\u2013they are super flexible!) We rolled the dice several times for the drinks and tried the lamb skewers, the octopus, and the ricotta fritters. The drinks were creative/memorable, with distinct flavors and interesting presentations. The skewers and octopus were both delicious and the portions significant\u2013in fact, we ended up skipping entrees. The ricotta fritters were alright; there were only a few of them, and the flavor was lacking. The atmosphere was welcoming/cozy. The music got a little loud in the later part of the evening, but it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing depending on your mood. Seating arrangement was also not ideal since all the groups were concentrated in one part of the bar, which also contributed to the noise. That being said, we appreciated the enthusiasm of the bartenders/wait staff, and enjoyed a free shot together with the other guests in the bar. It\u2019s definitely one of the best cocktail bars in the North End\u2013 worth a visit! This place was really fun. Cozy vibe and hearty food. The carbonara in particular was amazing. I liked the theme a lot as well, and rolling a 20 sided die to pick a random cocktail was a really fun touch. I got 2 random drinks and one was quite good, the other was fine but still worth the experience to get it. I would highly recommend Parla. The cocktail selection was outstanding.  I got a real kick out of rolling the die to determine what surprise drink I was going to have - and they recorded it on my card so on the next visit they can make certain I don't roll the same drink again.\nErnesto's Parmesan and the Spaghetti Carbonara were excellent.  Too full to consider dessert on this visit.\nService was superior.  Small space - reservations required! I had an incredibly disappointing experience here, especially on Valentine\u2019s Day, when good service should be a priority. The staff\u2019s attitude toward customers was unprofessional and unwelcoming. If you\u2019re tired or unmotivated, that\u2019s understandable, but expressing it outright with statements like \u201cI\u2019m very tired today\u201d is simply unacceptable in a customer-facing role.\n\nThe wait time was inconsistent\u2014They were initially told 50 minutes but ended up being seated in just 10. While that might sound like a positive, it felt like they were rushing people out constantly, creating an unpleasant and pressured atmosphere. Instead of making customers feel welcome, it seemed like they didn\u2019t even want us there.\n\nThis was the first time I\u2019ve encountered a bar where both the service and the attitude made me feel unwelcome. We won\u2019t be returning, and I\u2019d advise others to think twice before visiting. i had such high hopes for this place but the food truly let us down. while the ambiance + drinks + service were above and beyond unique/ incredible, the food left so much to be desired. the carbonara was so bad. as an italian and a cook, it was obvious they also used cream, yet didn\u2019t disclose that on the menu. additionally the pancetta wasn\u2019t pan fried/ rendered first, making most of the pieces inedible. the burrata/ tomato app was so cookie cutter, just thrown on the plate with no salt or pepper or olive oil??? the brussel sprouts were unseasoned and undercooked grease sponges. overall disappointed by the food but did have a couple of redeemable dishes: the homemade pappardelle with lamb rag\u00f9 and the crispy calamari were very yummy Great cosy restaurant with comfort food done to perfection with interesting accents. Their fish is amazing! Being in the north end, you can expect to pay a little more for the food here than you might elsewhere, and it's worth it. Went here as a group of 10 and everything we got was excellent. The fusion between Italian and Peruvian cuisine is a slightly different take than the more traditional Italian restaurants in this area which is another big plus. A true hidden gem. The specials were fantastic, this was the best meal I've had in 5 years in Boston. The menu is really unique - it isn't a mix of Peruvian and Italian dishes, each individual dish is a mix of the two cuisines which was really interesting and turned out to be very very delicious. We also loved the waiter! The food here was outrageously good. My husband's steak was one of the best I've ever had. My pasta was amazing - I had a ravioli special with asparagus and mushrooms. My friends all loved their food, specifically the orecchiette pasta and the lobster and crab ravioli. Highly, highly recommend this place. Beautiful atmosphere, wonderful service, very good food. I have to admit that I didn't really enjoy my main course, it had a blanket of spice that obscured all the other flavors, but the starters and desserts were absolutely incredible. We were a big and indecisive group, and our server very kindly accommodated us. Open air second floor had really great ambiance too. Just tried Mother Anna\u2019s in Medfield last night. The food was amazing! It was North End dining but without the drive into Boston. The staff were so friendly and the inside was very well designed. They mentioned being reservations only as they get setup which is completely understandable. I\u2019m sure that will change soon. I couldn\u2019t tell they just opened since everything was well organized. I can\u2019t wait to come back again and try take out once they get that started. We had four meals and we all enjoyed them. Big portions and reasonable prices. Large menu. Gnocchi Juliana was great, eggplant Parm was good with lots of sauce, char-broiled chicken was very tasty with lots of garlic, and tortellini Alfredo. Salad was good also. Only complaint is that we requested a third basket of bread and were told they ran out of bread!?! Then the people that sat down next to us were given a basket of bread. If there is a limit of two, just tell us! Stopped in on a Monday night. Seating was available with no wait. Waitress was attentive, polite, and friendly. Calamari appetizer was tasty! Order the Gnocchi and Chicken Parm dishes and came out in 10-15 minutes. Food was delicious. Also order 2 glasses of red wine and 2 beers. Wine was chilled and beers were cold. Overall, this place is solid. Check it out! I had a wonderful lunch here with delicious dishes and attractive city view. The weather was also so beautiful so that we ordered many drinks to enjoy the outdoor atmosphere of the spring. I love the sangria and the sunset cocktail. The lobster ravioli was a bid different with the one on the website but still ok. I also love the Veal Roberto and the Seafood pasta. Everything was so perfect that day so I definitely recommend this place. We sat at the bar. The bartender did not crack a smile. The food was OK. Had chicken, broccoli and pasta. Very salty. And not a lot of chicken. My husband had chicken masala that had way too many mushrooms on it. At the end of our meal, it took a while for the bartender to give us our bill. While we\u2019re waiting, she threw an empty wine bottle in the trash and made a huge loud crashing noise. Not the best experience. The most lovely dinning experience with beautiful food and top-notch service. The oysters, charcuterie, carpaccio,  seafood risotto and lobster pillows were all phenomenal. Service was great, loved the low lit atmosphere. Server\u2019s recommendations were solid choices, and included the clam spaghetti we came in for. Rated food -1 star at 4 as the clam spaghetti was a bit salty vs others we\u2019ve had elsewhere. All other food was WOW! The oysters, particularly the Ichabods, were delicious and flavorful.  The main courses, Seafood risotto and Aqua Pazza were amazing!  The risotto was out of this world delicious.\nNot really sure why ice water seemed difficult.\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t hesitate to go back! When my wife and I were walking by Aqua Pazza we decided to stop in for an early dinner. Food was tasty and we really enjoyed the pasta sampler special they had.\nMain reasons I would not give the restaurant 5 starts include: seating was very tight/uncomfortable, restaurant was extremely hot inside, and the bathrooms were not clean.\n\nWe might return in the future. Worth trying for the food My husband and I recently had our wedding rehearsal dinner at Aquapazza. It was a tremendous experience. From the moment we met Matt many months before the event through the dessert being served, the service was exceptional. Matt took pride in every aspect of planning the dinner and it could not have been better. The food was delicious and served timely for our large party. Every element of the evening was executed with class and care. Matt and the staff at Aquapazza made our guests feel so comfortable and they are still raving about the food today. We would absolutely recommend Aquapazza for any sort of large group dinner. It was a 10/10 experience! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Amazing Sandwiches & Great Service!\n\nI had an absolutely delicious fried chicken sandwich at Paul\u2019s Subs & Wraps! The bread was perfect\u2014no trans fat\u2014and the sandwich was packed with crispy fried chicken, fresh tomato, lettuce, cheese, and ranch dressing. It was one of the best sandwiches I\u2019ve ever had, even compared to places in Texas!\n\nThey also made a wrap with the same ingredients, and it was just as tasty. Other people in my group had the lobster roll, which was incredibly fresh and flavorful. The iced tea was a great deal at just $2.50.\n\nThe food was prepared very quickly, the staff was super friendly, and the overall atmosphere was nice. I\u2019d definitely come back\u2014highly recommend this place! This place is legit good!! Lobster rolls are fresh and buttery. Toasted to perfection \ud83d\udc4c staff were friendly and I ordered the clam chowder which was also very creamy and not fishy at all. Overall good experience, I sat and ate at the restaurant. The Diners, Drive ins and Dives Guy Fieri also been there. Not sure if it was featured in one of the episodes though. $29.99 for lobster roll and $7.99 for the chowder. Traveled to Boston for the 4 Nations Face-off and stayed a few blocks from TD Garden. Local bartender at Durty Nelly's referred us to Pauli's. It was a great suggestion as the food was outstanding there! My Canadian buddy and I both had the cheeseburger on their fresh daily made buns and it was amazing! Definitely worth stopping in for a superb foodie experience. First meal in Boston!\n\nWe ordered:\nlobsta roll seafoods $28.99/ea, forgot to grab a bag of chips\nsmall NE clam chowder $7.99\nfish and chips dinner $18.99\n\nI personally had the fish and chips, and first time eating pollack. Definitely a heavily fried meal. The meal did include fries and onion rings which were pretty good.\n\nRest of the group enjoyed the other items. Overall, food was good, but definitely don't pick fish and chips if you don't want an overly fried meal.\n\nSome seating inside...we opted to eat at the park nearby.\n\nStaff is quick to push out food and to-go orders.\n\nParking is super difficult during peak times. We ended up parking in a garage. Late post - visited in October 2024\nWe came around 6 pm, it wasn't too busy for dine in. However, I did notice they get a lot of to go orders. The cashier seemed unfriendly and didn't greet us when we came in, which is fine, just an observation. The food was made hot and fresh. It was good and we enjoyed our meal. I just wouldn't go out of my way to visit again. Nothing negative about this place, it just didn't stand out to me. I'd heard so much about Monica's before my first visit that I was worried I'd be disappointed. If anything, the food was UNDERHYPED: the sandwiches were absolutely outstanding, with fresh and delicious ingredients perfectly arranged to make the best Italian sub I've ever had. I'm absolutely not exaggerating when I say that I was daydreaming about it a week later.\n\nThe counter-only service was quick, friendly and efficient, and the prices are reasonable for the high quality of the food.\n\nIf you like top-quality, fresh ingredients, or just love a good sandwich, Monica's is an absolute must! Monica\u2019s Trattoria in Boston\u2019s North End offers an inviting, bustling atmosphere that perfectly captures the essence of traditional Italian dining with a modern twist. From the moment you step in, you\u2019re greeted by an open-concept kitchen where chefs work with visible passion behind exposed brick walls and softly lit, candlelit tables\u2014a setting that blends old-world charm with a contemporary vibe.\n\nFor dinner, our experience began with a creative duo of cocktails\u2014a classic Cosmopolitan paired with a Sparkling Strawberry Margarita for $16. The margarita, featuring Zarpado blanco tequila, Grand Marnier, strawberry pur\u00e9e, and fresh lime juice crowned with a prosecco float, was both refreshing and inventive. However, our reservation for 7:00\u202fPM did little to expedite the pace; it took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive.\n\nWe then sampled the Piatto di Prosciutto, a gluten-free appetizer priced at $10, which showcased 25-month-aged Prosciutto di Parma sliced paper-thin and served with a medley of mixed olives. The simplicity and quality of the ingredients spoke volumes about the kitchen\u2019s commitment to authenticity.\n\nFor our entrees, we opted for two standout dishes. The Vitello del Capo at $39 featured a succulent veal chop served over a bed of homemade gnocchi, complemented by a rich marsala wine sauce with shiitake and cremini mushrooms, along with speck that added a smoky depth to the dish. Meanwhile, the Spaghetti alla Carbonara for $32 brought together homemade spaghetti with Italian pancetta (a nod to the traditional cooked ham), egg, and Romano cheese, creating a comforting yet refined plate that satisfied every craving.\n\nWhile the food was exceptional, the service\u2014though friendly\u2014left room for improvement. After our drinks, we waited another 20 minutes for our appetizer, and the entrees were delayed by an additional 20 minutes. In a venue as lively and open as Monica\u2019s, where every detail seems carefully curated, the sporadic service timing was the one misstep in an otherwise delightful evening.\n\nIn summary, Monica\u2019s Trattoria delivers a memorable dining experience that balances excellent, authentic Italian cuisine with a vibrant, open-kitchen atmosphere. If you\u2019re prepared for a slightly unhurried pace on busy nights, it\u2019s a must-visit spot for anyone looking to enjoy a taste of the North End\u2019s culinary tradition. Really liked the vibe of this Italian restaurant. I ordered the fried calamari which was really crispy and for the main course I ordered the lobster pasta which was probably the best dish I could\u2019ve ordered because I enjoyed it a lot. Yes, it was a bit tedious to break open the lobster shell but it was really delicious and definitely worth it. 10/10 for the presentation as well. I think this was the best meal for us in Boston. We went on a Sunday around 7pm without a reservation and were seated in 5 mins (I recommend getting a reservation if possible). The restaurant was very lively and our server gave us some good recommendations.\nThe food was fresh and delicious. The drinks, entrees, dessert. Everything was perfect.\nIt was a tight table but we kind of managed just fine. I really liked the espresso martini and the eggplant parm. I dined at Monica\u2019s yesterday and I can\u2019t stop raving about how amazing the food was. The service was top notch, it was my friends birthday and they were very hospitable, they gave her sparklers on her cake. The interior decor, and attention to detail was on point, I felt like I was in Italy. 10/10 experience. P.S make sure you get the calamari, the best I have had. Nut allergy friendly: I had no issues with anything here, desserts are probably an issue.\n\nWe came to Rabia's on recommendation of some fellows across the street, as our other top choices all had 2+ hour waits on a Saturday night. Rabia's had only a one hour wait at 7:30PM so we got in at 8:30PM. It was quite a struggle to find a hostess but we finally flagged someone down. Around this time, the restaurant was significantly emptier.\n\nFor three people, we ordered:\nNorth End's Largest Meatball (4/5): It doesn't look like much, but it's a hefty piece of meat! For the three of us we said it was a good amount to balance out our seafood, but it could be easily shared with four people. Balanced texture and I really appreciate that it was served with a small salad.\nFradavolo alla Mediterranean (4.5/5 dropped to 3/5): Overall, it was an excellent dish. However, near the end, two of the mussels had such a briny, foul taste with a tough texture that we wondered what happened there.\nRisotto ai Frutti di Mare (4/5): Quite a rich dish with the tomato and white wine. We really enjoyed the seafood, but it could have used some extra kind of spice to balance out the richness. Maybe just a touch of cheese or pepper?\n\nService was not great. We were largely ignored and it took a while to get our orders and our bill.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our time here for a last-minute trek to North End, but I probably wouldn't come back. 3.5/5 rounded down for bad service. Aiysha our server made the experience a 100/10. We just came for fresh east coast oysters and they have a lot of different ones to try. We got a few of all of them. They were all delicious and we had a phenomenal time because Aiysha was so fun. First time going to Rabias Dolce Fumo in the North End of Boston.  Loved the authentic Italian vibe of this place and everything was amazing.  Service was top tier and food & drinks were delicious \ud83e\udd24 Ordered a dozen wellfleet oysters, shrimp cocktail, rigatoni alla bolognese, ravioli d\u2019 aragosta, and cioppino. For drinks we got margaritas and two goblets (north end and Paul revere).  Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the north end!  Will definitely be back next time I\u2019m in the city. Ordered a dozen welfleet oysters .. so good and fresh.. ordered the cioppino all very fresh. Great drinks and loved our server :) it was the perfect pre airport meal We had a really fantastic dinner tonight. To start, our server was excellent. Knowledgeable, friendly, just the right amount of attention.\n\nThe food was awesome. We started w oysters, the had some of the best lobster bisque I\u2019ve ever had. Then the zucchini flowers which were super tasty. Lastly we had the butternut squash and the apple ravioli- both incredible. We had a great time at Parla. Requested a nice table when making a reservation, and were pleasantly surprised that the best table in the place was waiting for us when we arrived\u2013right by the window with the best views. Their dungeon master list is a lot of fun if you are feeling adventurous and are ok with the dice making the cocktail decisions. However, be prepared to receive drinks you may not enjoy as much. If you are particular with your drinks, I recommend ordering something from the menu (or something you want off the menu\u2013they are super flexible!) We rolled the dice several times for the drinks and tried the lamb skewers, the octopus, and the ricotta fritters. The drinks were creative/memorable, with distinct flavors and interesting presentations. The skewers and octopus were both delicious and the portions significant\u2013in fact, we ended up skipping entrees. The ricotta fritters were alright; there were only a few of them, and the flavor was lacking. The atmosphere was welcoming/cozy. The music got a little loud in the later part of the evening, but it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing depending on your mood. Seating arrangement was also not ideal since all the groups were concentrated in one part of the bar, which also contributed to the noise. That being said, we appreciated the enthusiasm of the bartenders/wait staff, and enjoyed a free shot together with the other guests in the bar. It\u2019s definitely one of the best cocktail bars in the North End\u2013 worth a visit! This place was really fun. Cozy vibe and hearty food. The carbonara in particular was amazing. I liked the theme a lot as well, and rolling a 20 sided die to pick a random cocktail was a really fun touch. I got 2 random drinks and one was quite good, the other was fine but still worth the experience to get it. I would highly recommend Parla. The cocktail selection was outstanding.  I got a real kick out of rolling the die to determine what surprise drink I was going to have - and they recorded it on my card so on the next visit they can make certain I don't roll the same drink again.\nErnesto's Parmesan and the Spaghetti Carbonara were excellent.  Too full to consider dessert on this visit.\nService was superior.  Small space - reservations required! I had an incredibly disappointing experience here, especially on Valentine\u2019s Day, when good service should be a priority. The staff\u2019s attitude toward customers was unprofessional and unwelcoming. If you\u2019re tired or unmotivated, that\u2019s understandable, but expressing it outright with statements like \u201cI\u2019m very tired today\u201d is simply unacceptable in a customer-facing role.\n\nThe wait time was inconsistent\u2014They were initially told 50 minutes but ended up being seated in just 10. While that might sound like a positive, it felt like they were rushing people out constantly, creating an unpleasant and pressured atmosphere. Instead of making customers feel welcome, it seemed like they didn\u2019t even want us there.\n\nThis was the first time I\u2019ve encountered a bar where both the service and the attitude made me feel unwelcome. We won\u2019t be returning, and I\u2019d advise others to think twice before visiting. i had such high hopes for this place but the food truly let us down. while the ambiance + drinks + service were above and beyond unique/ incredible, the food left so much to be desired. the carbonara was so bad. as an italian and a cook, it was obvious they also used cream, yet didn\u2019t disclose that on the menu. additionally the pancetta wasn\u2019t pan fried/ rendered first, making most of the pieces inedible. the burrata/ tomato app was so cookie cutter, just thrown on the plate with no salt or pepper or olive oil??? the brussel sprouts were unseasoned and undercooked grease sponges. overall disappointed by the food but did have a couple of redeemable dishes: the homemade pappardelle with lamb rag\u00f9 and the crispy calamari were very yummy We were recommended this place by a gentleman we met at carmelinas. So glad we stopped by.\n\nWe came in last week during the Fisherman\u2019s Feast, so it was incredibly dead inside but we didn\u2019t mind cus we enjoyed having the place to ourselves. Ambiance is so/so. Food was so good that the other minuses didn\u2019t really matter (but still does).\n\nWe got the scallops appetizer - that left us fighting for the last bite because that\u2019s how good it was.\n\nI got the tagliatelle bolognese- I\u2019ve had better buttttttt it was still delicious!!\n\nMy bf got the veal parm - not rubbery, not over cooked, just right. As you can imagine, that too was all gone.\n\nI got a glass of NZ SB, can\u2019t remember the name but it was crispy, lots of bright fruit with a little bit of a longer finish. Paired perfectly with the scallops.\n\nService - wasn\u2019t bad, she knew when to be there and when not to be. The only issue I have is awareness for the busser. As I mentioned, we were the only table in there so banging plates to set up an empty restaurant made us feel little uncomfortable.\n\nAll in all, ARTU\u2019s was a 9/10. Charlie our server was phenomenal! Best service I\u2019ve ever experienced in the North End. He was knowledgeable and had great recommendations. Food was delicious! Over a year we tried around 40 espresso martinis in the North End, we ranked this one #2! Would\u2019ve been #1 but they don\u2019t add 3 beans. Highly recommend! I got to Boston late one night around 10:30pm. I was very hungry and started exploring what kitchens were still open. Decided to take a walk on Hanover Street. Around 11pm took a right on Prince Street and opened the door to Artu. There was no one there except a couple of people behind the bar that alerted me that the kitchen was still open. I had a very low expectation of what I was about to consume.\nTo my surprise the food was phenomenal!\nI ordered a caprese salad that had super fresh mozzarella and tasty tomatoes. Short Rib ravioli was right after as a main course, and also amazing!\nAs I was finishing my meal, Artu filled up with patrons looking to grab a drink and a late night snack.\nI was glad that spontaneity and a little luck landed me at Artu! Great place with awesome food.\n\nUpdate 12/21/2023\nBrought my two older sons here. Just as awesome as the first time!!!\ud83e\udd47 Great service at the bar. The chicken Marsala was great. The spaghetti bowl was good too. The sauce is fantastic. Large portion of sangria too. Great Italian food here! I was very content with my meal and so was the rest of my family. Although it wasn\u2019t anything crazy special, I enjoyed my short rib ravioli. Our salad unfortunately was way too doused in dressing. As per the service though, they were great at refilling our waters, but it would have been nice if they had offered grated cheese on our entrees. Besides those small complaints, I was very happy and definitely recommend this place to try! This was amazing. I wish I could've eaten fifteen more times there to try everything. The pasta fagioli was delicious. My daughter ordered \"chicken fingers\" and they were the most delicious chicken cutlets. Service was kind of rushed, and I wish we were seated in the back where it was less crowded, but over all this is a must try. If you\u2019re in the North End and craving some classic Italian food, this spot is a winner. The pasta is fresh, the sauces are rich, and the spinach crepes appetizer is a must-try\u2014light, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. The place has a cozy, welcoming vibe that makes it great for a casual dinner or a special night out. The service is friendly and attentive, making the whole experience even better. Whether you're in the mood for a big plate of pasta or just want to enjoy a delicious appetizer, this place won't disappoint. Wife and I are in Boston for her work. Beneventos was recommended as a place to have dinner. I am glad we listened. We had a reservation at 7, got there a little early and they were able to seat us. Amanda was awesome, drinks were great and the food was even better! If you like Italian food\u2026. This is the place to go and make sure you ask for Amanda! The Spukonie pizza is fantastic! The ricotta and sausage are so rich and sweet. They can shred some cheese on it for you after which melts with the heat of the fresh pizza. A single pizza can be comfortably split between two people. It\u2019s the type of pizza that fills you up but doesn\u2019t make you feel stuffed and gross after. I\u2019ve been three times and have only had the pizzas so far but they\u2019ve all been delicious.\nService is decent, nothing special and the atmosphere of the restaurant is okay too. They play good light popular tunes. It\u2019s pretty dark in the restaurant in the day time. They could increase the lighting a few notches.\n\nOverall I\u2019ll be back to try another pizza (I\u2019ve got my eye on the Beneventos) and maybe the bolognese! Amanda was great !! The sauce on the shrimp and calamari al la diabla was the best I have had in a while!! Best Italian I have had in a while !!  The North End experience is also great Looking for authentic Italian pasta without the hefty price tag?\n\nGiacomo\u2019s in the North End delivers big.\n\nI\u2019ve been twice, and each time, the chicken was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy, and full of flavor.\n\nThe sauces are what set this place apart. The lobster-based tomato sauce, packed with real lobster bits, tasted rich and fresh. The garlic cream sauce was light but forgettable for me. But the pesto cream sauce? Incredible. Thick, flavorful, and perfectly clinging to the pasta\u2014an absolute winner.\n\nThe cozy, two-floor setup adds to the charm. The first floor is lively and homey, while the second floor is quieter for a more laid-back experience.\n\nFor unbeatable pasta at a great price, Giacomo\u2019s is a must.\n\nJoin me in tracking down the best bites! Our experience at this restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we arrived, we were immersed in an authentic and cozy atmosphere that felt truly special. While they don\u2019t take reservations and there\u2019s often a line outside, arriving early is well worth it.\n\nThe restaurant stays true to its roots\u2014there are no cocktails, just an impressive selection of beer and wine, which perfectly complements the meal. While a few dishes, like the lobster roll and seafood pasta, seem catered to tourists, the rest of the menu is undeniably authentic.\n\nService was outstanding. We visited on a Thursday at 5 PM and were seated immediately. Our meal included mussels, veal parm, lobster ravioli in a cream sauce, and a Caesar salad\u2014all of which exceeded expectations. The veal parm was a standout, with a red sauce that ranks among the best I\u2019ve ever had. The lobster ravioli was delicate and rich, with a perfectly balanced cream sauce that wasn\u2019t too heavy. Even the bread was exceptional, setting the tone for a fantastic meal.\n\nWhat truly made the experience memorable was the relaxed, welcoming atmosphere. Despite the restaurant\u2019s high demand, we never felt rushed and ended up lingering for over two hours, simply enjoying the food and ambiance.\n\nThe pricing is also remarkable\u2014our entire meal, including two bottles of wine, came to just $160, making it an incredible value for the quality.\n\nIf you appreciate old-school Italian cuisine and don\u2019t mind a short wait, this restaurant is an absolute must-visit. Arrived here 5:15pm Monday evening. There were only two groups ahead of us so we got seated upstairs within ten minutes.\nThe restaurant itself is quite small, looked like seating for about 50-60 total between both floors.\n\nThe food is really delicious. The fried calamari is especially great, some of the best I\u2019ve ever had. For the pasta I would say it doesn\u2019t really matter what you get mixed in. You are going there for the pasta and the sauce.\nThe portions are very generous, and even though I have a big appetite it was difficult to finish.\nIt was a little difficult to get the waitress\u2019s attention at first, but once we put our order in, the food came out in a timely manner.\n\nPrice is reasonable for what you are getting. The bill includes a 20% gratuity. Cash only. Giacomo\u2019s Boston, North End.\n\nI was anxious to try this several friends recommended.  Long lines, but they move quickly.\n\nWhile in line you can chat with other customers or check the menu and try to decide what you\u2019ll choose.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, a staff member ushered us to the second floor. The second floor is cramped. And if you sit next to the drafty windows you may want to keep your jacket on.\n\nService is attentive and polite.\n\nAppetizers:  Fried Mozzarella, Meatballs & Garlic bread. Delicious.  Meatballs were warm definitely not hot. Garlic bread, fresh and warm. Mozzarella freshly cooked.\n\nMain course: Lobster Ravioli, Fusilli Siciliana.\n\nAll of these were delicious.  Albeit all the dishes were warm but not hot. Portions are generous. Fresh flavors.\n\nAgain the wait staff is attentive. No one is rushed and dining here is a nice experience.  Menu pricing is more than reasonable.\n\nI\u2019ll try again, but I hope I don\u2019t have to sit upstairs next to the drafty window! That definitely takes away from the pleasant experience here. One of the most popular North End spots with solid food but subpar service.\n\nCame here for an early dinner on Saturday. As expected, the line started forming quickly, but we were lucky to wait just 15 minutes. (Heads up: no waitlists, so you'll need to queue up.)\n\nWe started off with the burrata. It was good, but nothing special. Similar to what you\u2019d find at other North End spots (hard to go wrong with burrata). Mussels & Clams Fra Diavolo was underwhelming. Given its popularity, I expected more, but the sauce was mild and bland \u2014 not the punchy, spicy kick you\u2019d hope for in a Fra Diavolo. Thankfully, the Lobster Ravioli lived up to the hype. Even with the garlic cream sauce, the lobster filling still shined. Satisfying bites all around.\n\nService. I\u2019d heard horror stories about the service, and while it wasn\u2019t terrible, it was definitely on the lower end of what I\u2019ve experienced in North End. 20% gratuity wasn\u2019t automatically included on our bill (contrary to what I\u2019d heard), and one server was actually quite nice. Unfortunately, most of the staff seemed rude, and one even physically pushed me while I was waiting for the restroom \u2014 no apology, nothing.\n\nSince it\u2019s cash-only, the food is slightly more affordable, but overall, it\u2019s still not good enough for me to come back. Not even in my top 5 North End spots. If anything, I\u2019d maybe do a takeout of the ravioli, but that\u2019s about it. We had a great time at Parla. Requested a nice table when making a reservation, and were pleasantly surprised that the best table in the place was waiting for us when we arrived\u2013right by the window with the best views. Their dungeon master list is a lot of fun if you are feeling adventurous and are ok with the dice making the cocktail decisions. However, be prepared to receive drinks you may not enjoy as much.

Friend of mine got a tip that it fills up pretty fast so we should get there as soon as it opened.  Glad we did!  Soon as they opened, they were at 90% capacity and didn't take long to fill up.  We ordered the Spicy Shrimp as an appetizer, and then Bolognese and the Chicken Parm for our main entrees.   This restaurant may be small in size, but in flavor....   I was floored. Best Italian I have ever had.  I would recommend this spot to anyone and everyone!!  I will definitely be coming back! Carmelina\u2019s is an absolute standout in Boston\u2019s North End! From the moment we walked in, the service was beyond exceptional\u2014warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming. The staff made us feel like family, offering great recommendations and ensuring we had a fantastic dining experience.\n\nThe food was delicious, with fresh ingredients and bold flavors that truly elevated classic Italian dishes. Every bite was a delight, and the cozy yet lively atmosphere made it even better.\n\nWhile the food was great, it was the spectacular service that made this meal unforgettable. If you\u2019re looking for an amazing dining experience with top-tier hospitality, Carmelina\u2019s is the place to be! Can\u2019t wait to return! So much fun sitting at the counter watching these guys create meals. We thoroughly enjoyed our Italian food well within the North End of Boston. We shared a couple entrees and salads. Bread service was nice too. Rollati was over the top delicious, and the Lobster Ravioli was good too. Beet Salad along with the different style of Caprese Salad you have to try. Overall an outstanding experience, several restaurants to explore in the area, glad we were able to get a table right at opening on Sunday without a reservation. Awesome experience at Carmelina. The food was just superb, I myself ate the wild mushroom penne in which I would recommend to anyone who likes mushrooms and creamy pasta. Though if you don\u2019t like mushrooms my companions got items which they all liked a lot. Another thing to add is how nice and friendly the workers are. We were greeted with a big hello and great service throughout the whole experience. Thus I would highly recommend this restaurant to people who are in the Italian food mood-ML Quaint setting with huge portions of fresh pasta. We enjoyed all of our dishes and left stuffed. Service was excellent and a team atmosphere. Panza, nestled in the heart of Boston's Little Italy, might challenge your personal space with its tight seating arrangement, but it more than makes up for it with its culinary prowess. The intimate setting actually adds to the charm, creating a warm, cozy atmosphere that feels quintessentially Italian.\n\nA must-try starter is their bruschetta, which stands out from your typical fare. Topped with a sweet balsamic glaze, it strikes a perfect balance of flavors, leaving you craving more after every bite. The tomatoes are fresh, the basil is aromatic, and the glaze is just the right touch of sweetness.\n\nFor the main course, the Braised Beef Short Rib is a showstopper. Tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection, it falls apart beautifully at the touch of a fork, making each mouthful a rich and savory experience. The depth of flavor in the dish speaks to the skill and care in the kitchen.\n\nPanza is an absolute gem and a wicked pick for anyone looking for authentic Italian cuisine in Boston. Despite the close quarters, or perhaps because of them, dining here feels like being part of a special, bustling family meal. Whether you're a local or just passing through, Panza delivers a meal that's well worth the visit. We have eaten here on our last 2 visits to Boston because it's so good. The food is amazing and the service is great as well. There is limited seating and it tends to be busy, so plan accordingly. We will be back for sure! Really good food & attentive & friendly staff- they could not be more helpful. I was a single diner midweek from UK & found the prices reasonable for Brits . Drink range & prices $10 a big glass of branded wine. I had the lobster ravioli. Perfection on a plate. My coworker and I came on a Sunday evening. I was looking for a good risotto. This place was a bit quiet. With no wait compared to other places, I can't really complain. Anyway, we shared the seafood risotto and the lasagna. I care a lot about risotto being properly made (although I'm not a connoisseur... I just know what the process is supposed to be and tasted good ones) and also any pasta being fresh. This was just what we were looking for. Good portions, hot out of the kitchen, perfectly seasoned, and fresh. We're substantial eaters and the price was pretty good for great quality food. Btw, I saw some people say online that you can't make fresh risotto quickly, and I heard that it's possible to do some prep in advance. I think my risotto was pretty decently fresh. Recently went to Panza on a Thursday night. Our group of 4 had a 7:15 reservation and weren't seated until 8. The process of checking in for our reservation was pretty rough there was no hostess and they were just ignoring guests who were piling up with reservations. The employee who spoke with us was extremely rude and unapologetic and just told us to wait outside and provided no updates. She didn't seem to have any organized process for managing all the reservations they had.\n\nOn the bright side the food and service were good once we sat down. But the really poor experience getting checked in and seated on time mean I won't be coming back. No frills, tiny place with an open kitchen and good vibe. Nice wines served in a plastic cup? Ok we can get past that because the food is excellent.  Sicilian dishes with great red sauce and plenty of seafood options. Served super hot in the skillet right off the stove. Service was no nonsense good, and the prices were great for the large, quality portions you get. I love squid ink pasta, one of my all-time favorites. But the one here, honestly, it just wasn\u2019t good. I didn\u2019t even manage to finish it. At the very least, food should be fully cooked, right? Then we had the clams. And every single one was packed with sand. I absolutely hate it when I bite into food and get a mouthful of grit. I had one and immediately frowned, but decided to give them a second chance. Big mistake. Still full of sand. My boyfriend had the same reaction, so it wasn\u2019t just me being picky. Now, to be fair, the seafood platter was actually good. Generous portion too. I think two people could just share that and be full.\nThe place itself is tiny, and we waited a long time for a table. So here\u2019s my take: if you\u2019re walking by and there\u2019s no line, maybe give it a shot. But if there\u2019s even the slightest wait, please save your stomach, your time, and your sanity. Fantastic atmosphere paired with exceptional Italian seafood! We started with the squid meatballs, served in a rich and flavorful tomato sauce. The mussels were fresh and absolutely delicious. For our main, we shared a seafood pasta loaded with clams and calamari \u2014 perfectly done. Overall, we had a wonderful experience, and the host made us feel very welcome. I had a terrible experience at The Dally Catch. Right off the bat, the host/server was aggressive toward my party and I. We almost left after someone sitting right next to us in the cramped restaurant said that they were sick but the host stopped us and made a few strange, loud comments. In general, we felt very uncomfortable with the host\u2019s attitude towards us and other people at the restaurant. We ended up getting a table farther away and ordering the Lobster Fra Diavolo and fried calamari. Neither of those dishes lived up to their \u201cworld famous\u201d titles. The calamari was bland and not crispy enough, the sauce paired with it tasted stale. The pasta was shockingly bland and had a metallic aftertaste. The seafood itself was not fresh and added no flavor to the pasta sauce. I would not recommend wasting your money here. Not only is service and ambiance here disappointing, the food is below average. Vibes were great and our server was fantastic. Cozy dinner. There are only about 5 tables so definitely get here early. Seafood was fresh and not fishy. We ordered the clam linguine, calamari, and swordfish. All tasted fantastic though my dish was slightly too salty (this is a personal opinion and I still finished the entire dish nonetheless). I will let the photos speak for themselves. Everything feels worth the price. No frills, traditional Fiore was just excellent.\n\nThis is real Italian which allows good ingredients and produce to shine, no heavy cream, just right seasoning and they made me fresh gluten-free pasta which didn't collapse into mush!\n\nMy taste buds and gut were so happy! I didn't leave dinner bloated and in pain!\n\nAlso the seafood was fresh and sweet, the Chianti we had with dinner was delicious and, the service was personable and on point. One of Boston classic Italian restaurants in the North End, this was a culinary experience. From the cocktails to the dessert, everything was very enjoyable. Our waitress was funny and knowledgeable. She suggested a variation to my entree that I wouldn't have considered, but ended up liking.\nMy only complaint is that their rooftop was unavailable, but that's more a COVID-19 issue, so not holding it against them.\nOverall, definitely a place I want to come back to soon. Outstanding!  I enjoyed a fantastic meal at Fiore on Hanover Street in the North End of Boston this past Sunday. Brandon, the bartender, was friendly and engaging as I waited for the rooftop dining area to open. He maintains a beautiful bar area on the first floor, complete with a warm, cozy, Old World, \"dark wood\" feeling. The food was absolutely top rate. I started with the Baby Spinach and Beet salad with pancetta, mozarella cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. When asked if I could substitute the goat cheese with mozarella, my waiter told me that it would, of course, be no problem I followed with the Gnocchi with Italian sausage, potato gnocchi, mushrooms, tomato and herbs in a white, cream, two cheese sauce. Absolutely mouth watering! I enjoy large portions and I was not disappointed. Upstairs on the roof deck Ryan went above and beyond in making my much awaited lunch a great success. He was courteous, checked in regularly to make sure I had everything I needed and was satisfied and had a friendly, outgoing demeanor. The weather was great and the sun kept me feeling warm and \"Mediterranean\". When the receipt from the register did not match the prices on the online menu by a small amount, the restaurant manager, Cynthia, apologized and issued me a gift card for $25.00 for my next visit! Lunching at Fiore was a very memorable and fun experience. I recommend the restaurant, its' decor, staff and top quality cuisine. Sincerely, Art Blackburn, Hyannis, MA Visiting from Florida and simply stopped in for 1 drink\u2026 stayed for 3 hours\n\nMeet the owner, he gave us a restaurant Branded shirt and some food samples.\nWe ended up eating the lobster ravioli which was delicious, and had a couple martinis and then a very nice Cabernet.\n\nWe also met their seafood distributor, Joe \u201cfish\u201c who we talked with for a long time and absolutely loved their stories.\n\nA simple drink turned into one of the more fun experiences during our 10 day vacation This cozy restaurant has left the best impressions! Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation, wide wine list and more. We arrived without reservation for a Saturday lunch with a large group of 7 (adults and kids) and were seated right away at their beautiful patio! THANK YOU. I recommend to everyone! I would like to come back here again and again. Let's start with how we found this place. We were walking past on the way to get pastries and smelled something that brought me back to the fresh pasta my grandmother would make. We couldn't stop talking about the smell for hours. We only had one night left in town. Not only did they find us a reservation at a reasonable time, but they had no issue when we showed up a little early. The place has a comfortable welcoming decor and the servers treated us like we were family. The food was so authentic and delicious. I haven't had a good zuppe di pesce since my hometown Italian place closed years ago. I believe this place is that one place you find at the end of a rainbow and can't ever find again, except now it's saved in my Google maps favorites! Had a nice meal here. Particularly enjoyed the chicken lasagna, which had a bit more flavor. Food was fresh and light. Because it\u2019s around the corner from the busiest part of the North End, there was no wait and plenty of seating. The staff was nice and helpful. I was here twice while in Boston. First I dropped by for a glass of wine before meeting a friend. The bartender was super nice and friendly. I was the only one in the bar until another guy sat down. Turns out we had kids the same ages. We started talking and he shared some of his bottle of wine. Just a great place to sit and enjoy company.\n\nThen a few of us came back for dinner. It was a little loud and busy, but the service was spot on, the food (eggplant parmesean) was fantastic. I ate way more than I should have.\n\nThe wines they offer were enjoyable. I plan to visit again when in the Boston area. Delicious option for authentic Italian in the North End of Boston!\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 PRICE: This isn\u2019t the cheapest option, but you\u2019re paying for the experience. The bill for two cocktails, two entrees, and a dessert came out to around $130 including tip.\n\n\ud83e\udd42DRINKS: Had the chance to try their fall cocktails. Huge fan of the Apple Smash, a whiskey based cocktail. Such a perfect fall flavor!\n\n\ud83c\udf5d FOOD: I loved my nudi verdi. I thought they were cheesy and a cool take on gnocchi pasta. I did enjoy the sage butter, but I felt the dish was missing something. Perhaps the portion could also be just a bit bigger as I did finish feeling hungry.\n\n\ud83c\udf6eDESSERT: Quite disappointed by the tiramisu. While I was expecting a traditional creamy version, this was heavier on the ladyfingers/cakiness. Wouldn\u2019t order again.\n\nOverall this is a cute dining experience with satisfying food. I wouldn\u2019t up to 5 stars as I feel I\u2019m just missing the final oomph\u2014 but definitely not a bad choice! Had lunch here and the chicken soup was the best we have EVER had!!  Food excellent , atmosphere really relaxing, quaint and nice Italian music.  Our waitress (soooo sorry- don\u2019t recall her name) was so sweet, kind and efficient!  (Blond with glasses- says good friends with owner.)\nWe shall definitely return!! No frills, tiny place with an open kitchen and good vibe. Nice wines served in a plastic cup? Ok we can get past that because the food is excellent.  Sicilian dishes with great red sauce and plenty of seafood options. Served super hot in the skillet right off the stove. Service was no nonsense good, and the prices were great for the large, quality portions you get. I love squid ink pasta, one of my all-time favorites. But the one here, honestly, it just wasn\u2019t good. I didn\u2019t even manage to finish it. At the very least, food should be fully cooked, right? Then we had the clams. And every single one was packed with sand. I absolutely hate it when I bite into food and get a mouthful of grit. I had one and immediately frowned, but decided to give them a second chance. Big mistake. Still full of sand. My boyfriend had the same reaction, so it wasn\u2019t just me being picky. Now, to be fair, the seafood platter was actually good. Generous portion too. I think two people could just share that and be full.\nThe place itself is tiny, and we waited a long time for a table. So here\u2019s my take: if you\u2019re walking by and there\u2019s no line, maybe give it a shot. But if there\u2019s even the slightest wait, please save your stomach, your time, and your sanity.

I will let the photos speak for themselves. Everything feels worth the price. The pizza is the best authentic pizza in the area! The service was wonderful and the burrata app was delicious. As a fellow foodie and experienced pizza critic I'd definitely reccomend Cafe Amaro! Lovely Italian diner in the little italy area\n\nHad the chicken Parmesan which was excellent\nWife had the penne  bolognese which was also excellent .\nPlace is cozy and has great pizza and wine and dessert options . Delicious food, elegant and cozy atmosphere, and incredibly personable and efficient service. The caprese was fresh and fun and the fusilli alla vodka was delicate and mouthwatering. I love a lot of restaurants in the North End but will definitely be back here soon! Incredible experience overall! I went just before the dinner rush and was able to get a table by the window no problem.\n\nI have a lot of severe food allergies and the server was very willing to confirm with the kitchen about the ingredients of the dish. Very accommodating and checked in on me during my meal. I really enjoyed the small and intimate space as well! I went as a solo diner and was able to take my time, take in the view, and enjoy some of the best marinara pizza I've ever had. Would highly recommend this place as an intimate, cozy restaurant with great service. I noticed the place did fill up quickly due to the small amount of seating, so would definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time. Will be coming back here often :) Any time I have family or friends visit the city I bring them here! Very cute atmosphere and the food is amazing every single time. The baked pasta treats (baked ziti and baked gnocchi) really hit the spot! Large enough for two meals each, the food was divine. The service was really great! I loved the vibe, very cute and small but with so welcoming! I\u2019d def go back! Smaller spot in the North End for quick and delicious pasta. No reservations so you have to be quick to get tables but well worth waiting. Their baked gnocchi and the fettuccine and sausage special are great. I come here every time my family is in town and they do not disappoint. What an amazing lunch we had. We wanted to visit a mom & pop style restaurant and Dino\u2019s did not disappoint. The minimal seating made for an intimate dining experience. You can tell they clean often and have good practices behind the counter as well. The service was great, food came out within 15 minutes but they did not sacrifice quality at all. We split the cheese ravioli but honestly after one plate we could have had a second one! We also tried the homemade lentil soup and it was so good. 10 minutes after we sat down a line formed outside so we definitely came at the right time, and now knowing we would definitely wait next time we\u2019re in town. Thank you Dino\u2019s for a great Italian meal. Late post - visited in October 2024.\nLocated in Little Italy. You can smell the food as soon as you walk up to the corner. We came during lunch hours. It was busy, but we were able to find a table. My husband and I shared one sandwich. It was enough to fill us up. We ordered the chicken cutlet parm sandwich. Wow!!! It a burst of flavors. The chicken was moist and cooked to perfection. My only regret was not ordering another sandwich to take home for dinner. We were in the New England area for 5 days and I could NOT stop thinking about this place. Great casual family-owned restaurant in the North End. Food is delicious and prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get (photo is half of a sandwich). The food was INCREDIBLE! I have never had better Italian food and I\u2019ve visited a few different restaurants in the North End. This place blows all the others out of the water! Our server was also incredible (Marilee) she was able to give great recommendations and so friendly! Can\u2019t wait to come back! Definitely make a reservation ahead of time because it\u2019s always full of people! Looking for a nice Italian casual dining and this is the place. The staff is very professional. The ambience is that of an Italian genre and the food very rich plenty of room for small groups and large groups but can get very busy so ensure you make reservations on high peak days. In all this is a gem of a place added to your list if you\u2019re looking for a nice Italian dinner. Was a delicious italian food. We came around 4:30 pm on Monday, not crowded at all. We ordered a risotto pescatore and we had some white wine. The food was hot and very seasoned. Unfortunately we sow the owner being too rude to the waiters, so this bother us a little bit. Visiting Dolce Vita feels like a journey to the heart of Italian dining, thanks to the owner, Franco. He charmingly insists, \"You don't need a menu,\" and instead recommends a dish based on your current mood. This personal touch transforms each visit into a unique culinary adventure.\n\nThe ambiance is just as delightful, adaptable for romantic evenings, family meals, or casual dining. What truly makes Dolce Vita stand out is the inviting atmosphere, reminiscent of a cozy corner in Italy. Franco and his team's warm hospitality ensure that every visit is not just a meal, but a memorable experience. Me and my family had an AMAZING experience at this restaurant, which was highly recommended by a friend. Service was excellent and attentiveness was absolutely on point! The food by far some of best Italian we\u2019ve ever had. Franco, the owner, personally checked on us several times throughout our visit and made us feel like family. We were serenaded by a gentleman playing the accordion\u2014WOW! Next time we visit Boston, we WILL definitely eat here again. But don\u2019t take my word for it\u2014go experience it yourself! Some of the best Chinese take out I\u2019ve ever had! Everything tastes extremely fresh and high quality. The portions are huge and the prices are great. Dan was the most helpful person I have met since moving to the Boston area. He happily explained dishes on the menu, told me the best places in the area to sit down and eat the meal, and also the best place to go for desert! Support this family owned business and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Already looking forward to my next visit! The photos are of the orange chicken and the boneless short ribs, cannot go wrong with either of these; also try the fresh made egg rolls! Incredible food with incredible service to match. Our party enjoyed the Spicy Beef Lo Mein, Chicken with Broccoli, Orange Chicken, Chicken Fingers, and Chicken Teriyaki. Three bites in and we are already planning our next order! I was visiting Boston from Singapore and came across this shop. This is a great place to have Chinese food. They only offer takeout or delivery, no seating is available. Do not let that deter you though, as I must say that the food is definitely authentic and tastes fantastic!\n\nI ordered their General Gau's Chicken and Boneless Spare Ribs with fried rice. The fried rice had a 'wok hei' which is a mark of great culinary skill. Portions were very generous and prices cannot be beat. It was probably hands down the best Asian meal I have had on this trip.\n\nDaniel served me enthusiastically and told me that theirs is a family business they have run for more than 30 years. They take pride in what they do and it shows in the quality of what they serve. I can't recommend this place enough and anyone in Boston looking for Chinese takeout should look no further! Very small place with not a single table. CASH only. The portions were huge, I would say for two people, not for one. Did not enjoy the food. Could be much better. We loved this place! Generous portions of amazing food for a good price, with really fast and kind service. One of the best lo mein dishes I have ever had. Lots of vegetables and proteins are included and the flavors are on point! Dan who took our order was incredibly nice. We would visit again! This was my first visit here. It was very cute inside. The waitress was great she checked on us often and answered all our questions when ordering. The espresso Martini was delicious. Our table bread was crisp and ho it had the perfect texture. We got mussels for our appetizer. The sauce was perfect. I had the lobster fra diablo for my entree I felt my lobster was a bit undercooked it looked different from any lobster I\u2019ve ever eaten   The waitress took it back. But when she brought it back she said the cook heated my food. The same lobster was on my plate and still didn\u2019t look good.   That was the only thing I didn\u2019t like about the visit it threw the rest of the meal off. Might give it another shot next time I\u2019m around there Food was fine-nothing special especially for its high prices. I got the linguine shrimp and it desperately needed more flavor. I tasted the other pasta dishes and they were pretty average too. Drinks are very expensive too - espresso martini $19 and spritz $15.\nService itself was fine, our waiter came only to give us bread and the check, nothing special there either. Was a little annoyed because they kind of rushed our dinner and had us out really fast. The restaurant itself is very small, dark, and very very packed. Great corner cafe on busy Hanover Street in the North End. Small, cozy, nice bar, where I dined solo prior to a show at TD Garden, only a ten minute walk from the restaurant. Bartender quickly whipped up a delicious drink ($17 seems high even for Boston, so took away one star), and my shrimp scampi was perfect, five huge shrimp cooked just right, and the addition of roasted tomato and shaved parm were a nice touch. Would return and arrive early as I did this time to avoid waiting in line for a seat. The service and food were excellent. The Chicken Marsala is always one of my favorites and this is the best I have ever had.\nOur waiter Andre graciously changed our table when my husband requested the more desirable table that opened up by the window. Had brunch here. Very nice pasta and lobster omelette. However the service is a bit cold and feel like they want you to leave asap so they can't get more people in. Cantina Italiana was a delicious meal! We ate here on New Year's Eve so it was definitely helpful to have a reservation! The staff was super friendly and the food was good! We especially liked the gnocchi! The salmon was good as well. The free bread was another plus for dipping in the sauce. Definitely a great option in the North End! This was a perfect North End experience. Everything was first class. The food was exquisite as was the service. Delicious. If you are visiting like we were, there are a ton of opinions on North End dining. I highly recommend stopping here. Incredibly delicious and generous portions. Kind and attentive staff. We got vodka sauce pasta and an appetizer special. Highly recommend! One of the best chicken parm\u2019s I\u2019ve had !!!!!! If you are a chicken parm lover this is a must!!!!! They have the best Italian food here let\u2019s start off first with the focaccia bread and oil I absolutely love it because their oil has such a unique taste ! We got the pollo alla vodka but cantinas has a little twist to it which I love! It has pancetta on the cutlet under the cheese !!! The cutlet is super thin, crispy and paired with the best tasting vodka sauce!!! The pasta they give you with the pasta is insane! It\u2019s one of my favorites! If your in the city definitely visit the north end and go to this place you will not be disappointed! The service and wait staff are extremely nice and so accommodating letting you order anything you want the way you would like your meal ! I love when restaurants let you make substitutions and are so accommodating with any specific requests! I\u2019m so excited to be back again very soon!\n\nService 10/10\nAtmosphere 10/10 ( cute and cozy place)\nFood 10/10\nA MUST GO !!!!! We visited this amazing restaurant with a party of 11. I have to say we had the best service I have ever had, specially with a large party. The staff all worked like a well oiled machine with smiles and kindness. The food was epic. The drinks came fast and were perfect every time. I highly recommend this wonderful place to anyone looking for an amazing Italian food experience. Thank You to all the staff. We were family from all over meeting in Boston and we all agreed that was an amazing dinner. Phenomenal tortas. So, so good. This location was basic, but comfortable and staff very friendly. Carne asada tortas highly recommended! Awesome place for some Mexican food in Boston. When it comes to tortas in Boston, choices are pretty limited, so this was a nice fine. The chips and guacamole are nice, and the salsa isn't bad. The torta campechana was nice, though next time I think I'll try the tenoch instead. The torta was a great size, and was wrapped nicely (so, easy to eat). The inside of the restaurant is on the small side, so while you might find a place to sit, you might need to go somewhere else to eat. We were visiting Boston and had passed many expensive Italian pasta restaurants. We just wanted a good, easy lunch for 3 adults and 3 kids. I searched Mexican restaurants near me and Tenoch Mexican popped up. A short 2 minute walk, and we arrived to a cut older, original Boston building with all its charm! It is off the expensive beaten path, but easy to get to and oh, so worth it! The gentleman behind the counter was courteous, and helpful with our selections. The food was generous and excellent! We fed everyone for under $55. (3 adults, a 13 yr old, a 9 yr old, and a 12 year old) Highly recommend! I can't believe it took me this long to have a Torta. This one got me addicted with crispy fish, thick bread and the perfect mix of toppings. The tostada was fully loaded and the guac was fresh! Huge fan of the wall art as well - chill place to grab lunch or a late dinner. What a fun eatery! We enjoyed a burrito (asada con queso), three tacos (asada, chorizo, and suadero), and the chips with guacamole. Everything was yummy, but the chorizo and suadero tacos were our favorite.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated simply but colorfully, and the dining area felt organized and clean. The staff was friendly and quickly prepared our food. We waited no longer than 10 minutes, but we also arrived during a lull in orders.\n\nWould recommend! :) My husband and I found this quaint restaurant on maps after finishing a very long whale watching tour. Even though we were wind blown tourists and didn\u2019t have a reservation, they were able to accommodate us. The food was excellent and the staff was friendly. One of the staff even sang a few songs- in Italian- and he was very good! Thank you for helping us have a great anniversary dinner. A true gem in a sea of amazing restaurants.  Pino - the owner - has no trouble seating me with a backpack and duffel bag straight from the airport.\n\nThe hospitality is like being at his home - small but comfortable, high attention to detail to your needs, and meals that truly taste like what I had when I was growing up - fresh ingredients and made with love!\n\nDo yourself a favor, make a reservation there and enjoy the hospitality of Piccolo Nido\u2019s familiga.  Salud! Had a lovely dinner date on Wednesday night.\nGood food. Both of us enjoyed every dish. (Burner Google account because the owner is very heated in the reviews\u2026 quite unprofessional)\nI was told the restaurant has been here for 35 years and I have no idea how. The first sign that something was not right had to be the lack of attendance: there was only three tables seated the entire time we were there.\nThe food here was, simply put, not good. The \u201cgnocchi\u201d (dense cube of pasta) was covered in watery, metallic tasting sauce. The pasta dish I ordered was the most palatable (I hesitate to say good) by consensus of our group, but was still undercooked box pasta. The freshest flavor our group tasted was fresh out of a can. And the price was unbelievable for the quality of food - criminal even.\nWhile I care more for flavor than presentation, a few members of the group I was with pointed out that the presentation was juvenile. To be honest, I\u2019ve seen better presentation at high school cafeterias.\nThat being said, our waitress was very sweet and attentive, somewhat making up for the lack of any other positive force. I noticed that she was the only active employee up front and she still made time to make us feel attended to and important; bravo Queen! One thing to note was that as our meal ended with mostly full plates, the waitress seemed a bit nervous to take our full plates back to the kitchen.\nI took some time to read all of the review and noticed the sheer amount of 5 star reviews with little to no explanation for their score. If you are reading this take it as a reminder to always read the 1 star reviews before going to a restaurant.\n\nTakeaway: Waitress was great, but everything else, like the food, was bland. Delicious from start to end!  I have eaten at many places in the North End and Piccolo Nido is the best by far.  The food is exactly what you hope to get - authentic Italian prepared simply and with the best quality ingredients.  No wonder most of their diners were Italian!  We shared the veal Parmesan and gnocchi entrees and it was sheer perfection.  The owner graciously sent over homemade tiramisu for us to try and it was probably the best I have ever tasted.  The waitstaff was lovely and attentive and we appreciated how welcome they made us feel.  Will definitely be back soon. Quaint little hole-in-the-wall Italian restaurant that you should be looking up when you're in town. Warm and inviting staff and atmosphere with some outstanding Italian food.\nThe gnocchi was insanely good and the daily special scallops risotto was amazing. And, surprisingly, the app of Bruschetta was a shock. So simple but just a flavor bomb of basil garlic and fresh tomatoes.\nFinish it off with Affogato: ice cream drowned in espresso. Yeah, that's what I thought and then I had it. Delicious!\nGo to Boston, eat at Isabella's!! Highly, HIGHLY Recommended! Kudos to the chef and our wonderful waitress for making our dining experience unforgettable! The food was exceptional\u2014every dish was beautifully prepared and full of flavor. The pictures don't do it justice, so you'll just have to experience it for yourself. We highly recommend this place and can\u2019t wait to return! Our server was so attentive and the service was super fast. We ordered the chicken parm, fried calamari, and pesto gnocchi, all of which were delicious, super big portions. The vanilla gelato was so good too. Complementary bread dipped in some oil is always amazing. It has a very nice classic Italian atmosphere. Overall Isabella Restaurant is a great place to go for a night out with your family. The servers were attentive and worked as a team to make sure guests were attended to efficiently. It\u2019s a small spot\u2014 only about 8-10 tables I think. Vibe was great and the food came out quickly. A lot of great options and everything was incredible, but the gnocchi pesto was truly the stand out item. I won\u2019t be able to fully enjoy another gnocchi ever again after having this one! Tiramisu was also a plus at the end! Great place!  It was my first time in the North End and went here for a business dinner.  Staff were friendly and very professional. The food, well, it was amazing. We got a bunch of appetizers and the clams were great. I got the penne with Italian sausage. Decent espresso, very good muffin tops and scones.\nIt took them an awful long time to prepare a latte for a gentleman in front of me.\nIn addition to that, they did not even ask me whether I want a receipt which is a bit weird.\n\nOver all nice place with stable wifi though. BoCoCoCo, as we fondly call it, serves great coffee and surprisingly good food options as well. The bagel sandwiches and paninis are great and they are always happy to do substitutions or special orders. In summer they have a great selection of brewed iced teas that I love. Only issue is the weekend crowds leading to slightly slow service sometimes, but they do the best they can with it! Got a coffee to go here. Not the best in boston but it was decent. I have gotten a pumpkin muffin another time which was decent as well. Ample seating but some weird orientation. I do not know how it would be for doing work or if they offer wifi. Coffee was good although the service wasn't the best.. It was my First time visiting and I just wanted to know what good coffee options they had .. And she didn't have an answer for me I continued to ask questions but the staff and her seemed to be annoyed because I was taking to long. If she was a little more helpful it would of made it quicker.. This review is strictly for donut Thursday as I am a Thinking Cup loyalist when it comes to my coffee...but OMG you guys...on Thursdays BCC makes donuts, the flavors change each week and for the last two months I have not been disappointed. Make this a must stop on your list for thursdays, you will not regret it. Seated immediately without a reservation.  Curt, our waiter, was awesome!  He was funny, polite, and took care of us.\n\nThe lasagna was great.  The cheese ravioli was very good.\n\nIf you want to stand in line for hours for Italian food then go right down the street to Giacomo's Ristorante.  If you still want goo italian food, but would not prefer to stand in line for hours, then go right down the street to this place. I am from out of town and really wanted some good Italian food.  Co-workers suggested I go to North End because there are many good Italian restaurants to choose from.  I was told I can't go wrong.  Well I beg to differ.  As I walked along Hanover reading the various menus I decided on Cafe Pompeii because after all no matter which one I choose I couldn't go wrong.  It seemed like a nice, clean and quiet enough restaurant.  They were not very busy so I would not have to wait like some of the other restaurants I passed.  Anyway I ordered a salad and lasagna.  Everything was going fine, the bread was good.  I requested some balsamic vinegar to mix with the oil for my bread.  Really good.  I get my salad and then my lasagna and it was good but nothing to write about (I'm not writing this review about the lasagna).  Anyway I didn't have enough dressing for the rest of my salad so I grab the bottle of vinegar to pour on my salad and to my DISGUST I saw something moving in the bottle. I looked closer and there were 1,2,3 GNATS swimming around!!! Long story short I told the waiter and he did not apologize just said he would take the salad off my bill.  He then asked me if I wanted anything else.  Unbelievable!!!!!!  Needless to say you can go wrong so choose wisely!!  Just for the record even if there were not little bugs in the vinegar it was not good enough for me to go back. Came here for a quick slice of pizza and for a restaurant in the North End, I expected a lot more. The slice was large, but full of grease and tasted like floppy cardboard. They also are cash only which is always a pain. I gave two stars because they provided some pepper flakes to take with me and the staff was somewhat friendly. Actually pick this place over Mike's Pastry the first night in Boston based on trip advisory reviews. The atmosphere is excellent, the food is good but the service is just okay.\nWe had a few desserts and coffee. I would recommend just for their tiramisu. I thought it was very good. I've never had dinner here, but their cappuccino's are some of my favorite in the city. They are cash only, so be sure not to only have your card on you. I usually come here after dinner in the North End for a great mocha cappuccino. Caffe Vitoria is exactly my type of cafe. Vintage decor, very nicely curated space with friendly wait staff. Espresso martinis are usually hit or miss for me and this one was a hit! So smooth and perfectly balanced. I ordered an affogato as well and my sweet tooth was satisfied. Will be returning here when in Boston :) This is a perfect old-world Italian coffee shop.  The exact opposite of a soul less corporate place (cough, cough Starbucks).\n\nI'm not even a coffee drinker, but rather a tea person.   It's still one of my favorite coffee shops anywhere.  Try their pastries - you won't be disappointed.\n\nNote that it's cash only. I've been going to Caffe Vittoria in Boston's North End for decades.  First with family then I would bring friends there during afternoons or late night and it was always the perfect spot to get to pick me up.\nThese types of Italian coffee houses are few and far between and I'm so happy to see this one stay in the test of time. Great cash-only spot that\u2019s super popular! Wait was about 15min to get in on a Friday night, and well worth it! The espresso martini was not only pretty but really nicely balanced. The tiramisu was an absolute must-try, light and airy with a great espresso flavor. Definitely coming back and trying their pistachio martini cannolis and pretty much everything else! The place is very vintage! They claim they are the oldest Italian cafe in Boston since 1920. The place is big that you can\u2019t really tell from outside! They have smoking area! It has many old pictures and coffee grinders/ espresso machines. Their seats are not that comfortable but it\u2019s not bad for maximum couple of hours stay. Drink was good (Espresso Mocha), prices are reasonable and they only take cash. Maybe I didn\u2019t get it?\nSign says please wait to be seated\u2026. Ok.\nAfter a minute staring at the bar I get \u201csit anywhere\u201d. Ok.\nI wait\u2026 must have to order at the bar?\nFelt like I was interrupting the 3 behind the bar.. but there were only 8 of us in the whole place.\nI order\u2026. Wait there? Bring it to me? Who knows at this point?\nI sit\u2026 notice my espresso is up at the bar. Ok, I\u2019ll come get it.\nGood espresso, really good cake.\nI\u2019ll be back to try it again. Just during the day this time. Friday April 11th the service impeccable! The best servers of my entire life!!! Amazing women who are the most hardworking and precious women!\nWould recommend a thousand times over and over! If there was heaven on earth it is here! One person in our party got the espresso martini which looked well made and had no complaints. I got the affogato martini and it was very well presented, strong shot of coffee and the cookie was certainly cute. Service was great, but the tables and chairs weren\u2019t all kept clean, and the martini taste wise was good . . .  but not great for the price. But over all not a bad spot. Delicious Gluten-free Tiramisu! Specialty Coffee's were expertly crafted. Nutella Cappuccino/ Mocha Latte/Cappuccino/Chai Latte! Highly recommend! Well, the drinks we ordered were so good that they didn't make it for photos! The staff were lovely and sweet and allowed my dog Lola inside and gave her treats. We had tasty a lunch of paninis, caprese, and cake and ordered nutella hot chocolates. Fantastic place to watch sports and enjoy amazing food and hospitality in Boston! Always love coming here in the mornings on the weekend. My regular order is the Panino and a double espresso. They also have really good cannolis! Espresso and pistachio martinis are also delicious. It's nice to just sit and down and relax here while sipping on your drink. Good better best - here it is. Great vibe, comfortable, not over crowded with a small, but nice selection of coffees, sweets and cocktails featuring martinis. Sit and relax\u2026. Enjoy Very nice cafe in the North End. We tried their famous Espresso Martini & Lemondrop Martini, and both delivered. We also tried the Tiramisu and Cannoli, also very good. Staff was very friendly and tentative. I do recommend this place. Perhaps the worst gelato service in the northern hemisphere. I asked the lady for \"2 scoops of gelato in a cone\" and her blank stare response was \"let me ask the manager.\" When I went to pay, she couldn't do math. Also, way overpriced. Go to Italy instead. Loved everything we got here (chocolate cannoli, cappuccino, chai latte) plus service was very friendly! Galleria Umberto is a Pizza shop in the North End serving Sicilian style pizza at decent prices and portions, well known for their food.\n\nThe line wasn't too long, but the pizza came out quickly and the service was excellent.\n\nWe got slices of cheese pizza to try. The pizza was a bit hot but not too oily, and the size was decent for the price. The pizza tasted really good, what you'd expect and want for pizza. Definitely a place to go again and eat at. It's what everyone else says. This place is awesome. If you have the patience, please wait for your Sicilian style slices to cool, because they come out piping hot and will burn the roof of your mouth. Well-priced. These owners take pride in the process and product. Next time I'm in the North End, will get a slice and maybe some arrancini depending on how I feel. Maybe better for takeout on a park bench 'cause that will give the slices some time to cool. My sister brought me here today! First time trying heard so much about this spot it's legendary I got the classic Sicilian pizza and got Salami and ham and ricotta cheese calzone and the Spinach and cheese calzone. The pizza was so so good the cheese and the sauce and the crust was crispy and delicious! Next I tried the spinach and cheese calzone the spinach was moist and seasoned well the bread was golden brown on the outside and moist in the middle cooked perfectly so scrumptious and delicious! Staff and customers Service is friendly and welcoming when being served. Okay, unpopular opinion here....I think this place is hyped so much solely because of the value for what I would classify as just \"good\" food. The pizza was good; my husband thought it was amazing. The crust was some of the best I've ever had, but I felt it needed more cheese to balance it out. The panzarotti were just not my jam; mashed potatoes stuffed with cheese, breaded, and deep friend sounds knock-your-socks-off delicious, right? But it was my least favorite thing I ate there. It was lacking flavor/seasoning in my opinion. The Arancini was very well made and had good flavor and I had an almost bagel type thing with meat sauce stuffed in it and a slice of cheese melted on top; this was my favorite item (and I can't recall what it was now)! It was soft and hot and flavorful.\n\nAll that being said, you simply cannot beat their prices for a quick lunch spot --- for what they charge, their food is a great value. two of us ate more than our fill, trying almost everything on the menu with a coke for each of us, for $20. It's insanely busy so be prepared to take your food to go due to lack of seating for how many customers (and food tours) they get. The pizza here is one of the best pizzas you will have in your life.\nIt is absolutely fantastic.\nGive this place a try and I promise you won\u2019t regret it.\nThe only problem with the place is the line up. But service is very fast. Bobby runs one of the best coffee stores in Boston. Genuinely lovely guy and the staff know their stuff and are happy to help. The house blend is my go to but lots of fantastic options. Best coffee beans in Boston! I love this place. It\u2019s very old, historic, and beautiful. Aside from coffee they sell other gems as well. But the coffee is the best. What got me is how reasonable the prices are. I\u2019ve been multiple times and sometimes my coffee beans are less expensive then at a grocery store. Which is awesome, especially for the North End of Boston. I even picked up a cup of house blend while I was there. Perfect for sipping while roaming the streets of the North End, and Boston. Had some nice Italian ice while we were here! Did a walking tour and was lucky to stop at this place The aurora of Italian authenticity flows down the Salem street and attracts locals and tourists alike into the generational corner shop in Little Italy. They don\u2019t serve any diary  related coffee products (that\u2019s why you know it\u2019s super legit.) I have never seen this much variety of coffee beans stacked in shelves like a pharmacy store, quite an experience.\n\nThe expresso was super bitter, hence strong. You need to be a real coffee drinker to take it in.\n\nHighly recommended a place to visit in the North End. We were introduced to this places while on a food tour (North End Little Italy Food Tour with Bobby). The smells outside lure you in and the guys working could not be more friendly. They were very knowledgeable and had Great conversation. A fun place with a lot of history. Be sure to stop and get your coffee here! They also have a wide variety of spices Very vibey coffee shop. Stumbled across this spot while on a morning walk - and was so glad I did. Warm, welcoming, beautiful display cases, and lots of drink options. I tried the turmeric latte - fabulous - and really wished I hadn't gone to another bakery first. Such a nice spot to sit and sip! Only docked down a star since there was no wifi, and often I work out of coffee shops (and I was working remotely travelling and was surprised as most cafes have wifi) The Mixed Fruit Tart was delicious and a good chai tea latte. Plenty of seating with a variety of vibes. I loved the tables that has vintage newspapers inside them. Great for the local feel of being in North End Boston! Nice lighting inside and I loved the chandeliers in the front. The service was below average. While the coffee and scone were enjoyable, the grilled cheese and bacon sandwich were disappointing - the cheese was hard and not melted/grilled, and the bacon was excessively salty. Used cups, food tray, and pastry basket were all over the table, no one cleaning. This coffee shop is a fantastic spot to unwind with your favorite brew. While we didn't sample the food, both the Americano and cappuccino were excellent choices. Service was fast, and the staff were incredibly attentive. The atmosphere is inviting, with a clean and spacious layout. Access to the restroom is available via a keypad, exclusively for customers. Plus, they accept credit cards for added convenience. My chicken sandwich was good and we love this fruit tart as well. Hazelnut latte which I got was delicious. Busy but they\u2019re doing their best not to make you wait for too long. Love it,\nLove the style and the employees so caring and professional.  Except this place has a menu that is inspired by someone that knows food obviously, they have amazing home made muffins, that was what drew me in, I saw muffins walking by at night on the window that I came back 7 am next day on way to airport.  The muffin was the best part of the sandwich, I wish I can say the eggs were amazing too but they where just OK, not amazing but you can't always get everything perfect I guess.  Apple wood bacon was nice and thick but could be more crispy.\nWill be back\nKeep up the good work you guys are doing an amazing job. Sunny Girl is bustling on a Sunday morning, but their service stands out: friendly, helpful, and attentive!! It's especially true if you're unsure of what to order. However, my partner found an eggshell in their dish, which was disappointing. As for their original hot sauce, it was decent but lacked the kick and depth of flavor I expected.\n\nWhile the service and branding are top-notch, the food itself feels underwhelming. Given the long wait and the restaurant\u2019s popularity, I wish the food was better. The portions of the breakfast sandwich were quite small, making it less filling than I\u2019d hoped. My breakfast sandwich also tasted bland - with a lot of my favorite breakfast sandwiches, you can taste a little bit of everything but maybe the sunny Girl sandwich is not for me. It was nice to try at least. A very cute little sandwich shop right near a beautiful view of the harbor. Coming here early we found parking and were able to get our meal pretty quickly. Don\u2019t let the branding fool you, it\u2019s a different vibe in store and it\u2019s even better. I loved the music and the cashier! The sandwich is light and fluffy! So tasty. The avocado here is also well prepped and yummy! It\u2019s a little pricey but it\u2019s quite filling! Go with the sunny girl sando! Boston\u2019s best subs!! Oh my god, this place is sooo good! I\u2019ve been there multiple times and never disappointed! My absolute favorites are the Truffle Shuffle and the Sunny Girl OG! Best breakfast sandwich of my life. Not sure why sunny girl is not more well known but also want to keep this place lowkey and to myself. There\u2019s cute outdoor seating area and limited bar seating inside. More of a grab and go establishment with lots of pick-up and delivery orders. Recommend the Sunny Girl sandwich! The English muffin is to die for. Coffee is standard.

    "reviews": "Great selection of beauty products.  Love the help, they dress up for the holidays.  Great prices. Just another place in Faneuil hall Came to the Boston and tried out this pizza spot for the first time. Indoor seating is available. Individual slices are random. Just depends what they make. The slices are huge. Ordered a cheese slice which was square and a mushroom pizza slice. The pizza is on a fairly thin crust, like a naan texture. I would be curious as to what a personalized order would taste like. I had a pleasant dinner here with my family when strolling through the North End in Boston. We ordered a mushroom pizza, arancini, and meatballs. The food was delicious. The venue is quite casual and has limited seating though. Probably the best pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a slice while walking the Freedom Trail and I was super impressed. Large slices, lots of flavor, and not too greasy. If I ever make it back to the Boston area, this will definitely be a must to come back to. What stood out of this pizza was the tomato sauce used. Really potent, and really good. I would say more of a sweet flavor. Stop by and enjoy ! This place has some really great pizza. I've been to Rome before and had the pizza there and got spoiled. I was impressed that the pizza here taste pretty authentic. They have a cool brick oven that they cook the pizza in which is cool to watch. The taste is pretty close to real Italian pizza and the service is very fast. I would for sure go back again, the only thing is it is a tad bit expensive. Other than that I would say one of my favorite pizza places I've been to. I came here three years back, and this is my first night of return. Three years later, Valentine's Night. Let me just say, the service is and has been, phenomenal. The atmosphere is LOVELY and the murals on the ceiling and rich reds of the brick and dark woods of the place really set a beautiful vibe. But if you thought that was all I had to say you'd be dead wrong.\n\nThe food is PHENOMENAL. The chefs back in the kitchen really do their utmost best to please and it shows. Absolutely delectable meal for a decent price, and it made for a lovely, memorable dinner with the one I love. If I could give a place 11/10 stars, this would be it. Give it a shot next time you're in town! Family style event service is a bit awkward and cumbersome with the tight upstairs spacing and giant dishes to pass around. The event appetizers are pretty solid, but the primi and secondi dishes are a bit lackluster from poor texture and flavor. It seemed that the flavor was lost in the bulk food servings. The dining service staff are attentive and quick to help, but the upstairs bar staff were pretty cold. However, the wine was fantastic. Side note, the upstairs event space bathroom is quite small. Good atmosphere. Three floors. We had a reservation and they took us right on time or slightly early. Very busy. Recommend a reservation if possible. Pictured: Guazzetto di Mare (\rCalamari, imported \rbaby clams, fresh shrimp and filet of sole in \ra rich tomato sauce over pappardelle pasta) and Braciolettine alla Calabrese (veal rolled and stuffed with \rProsciutto and Mozzarella, \rpeppers, mushrooms, onions\r in a spicy pomodoro sauce), and a photo of the fresca-style ceiling Not pictured: Minestra di Fagioli and Calamari appetizer. All were delicious. This is our number one pick of all the north end restaurants! The house salad with homemade dressing is the perfect start! I followed with the eggplant which was perfect and my husband loved his chicken Marsala. Our waiter Carlos gave terrific recommendations and so glad we listened. The Italian red wine from Abruzzo was perfect with our entrees and we topped donner off with their homemade panna cotta and grappa! Went w 3 ppl and the meals were not the same quality. The penne pasta meal was bland and not special. Don\u2019t get that. But the Maccheroni Amatriciana?! Delicious. Yes. Get that. Both are pictured, this place is fun I just think u gotta order right Have been traveling up the East Coast for three weeks from DC to NY to Boston. Best coffee we\u2019ve had. Perfect roast. Not over, not under roasted. In an age of fruity, acidic millennial coffee craze, it\u2019s nice to have a touch of fruit, with a warm round roast. Masterfully done, and the play list was on point too! Caf\u00e9 Amalfi is a fantastic spot with a cozy atmosphere and great service. I stopped by for breakfast and had their breakfast sandwich which was absolutely delicious! The ingredients were fresh, the bread was perfectly toasted packing a bunch of flavor, and bringing everything together beautifully. I also tried the chocolate croissant, which was decent but nothing special compared to everything else they offer. The iced salted caramel cold brew was great, and the cold foam on top was awesome, smooth, flavorful, and just the right touch of sweetness.

I loved the sweets I got from here- I drank my coffee in the shop and took a strawberry parfait and baklava to go, they are amazing! I can\u2019t wait to come back! I recently visited Emmi Bakery, and it was an absolute delight! From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed by the friendly staff. The atmosphere was very inviting, making it the perfect place to enjoy a relaxing breakfast or a sweet treat. I met the owners and they were so sweet. Glad to see a family business like this one. I tried their signature Emmi salad, and creme brulee latte, they were amazing.\n\nHighly recommend! It's a very perfect place. The desserts were delicious. The coffees were very good. The staff were friendly and smiling. They answered every question I had. Although it has just opened, it is definitely a place I will always go to. A place where I will have a pleasant time with my friends or alone. The coffee was delightful, and the chicken melt sandwich and emmi salad was absolutely delicious. The location is also very convenient, making it a great spot to visit. Both my family and I had a fantastic experience and thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Great first experience at Emmi!! Having just opened, I was very curious how it would be, and it exceeded expectations!! Loved The Southie breakfast sandwich, can\u2019t go wrong with that. Also, they have the perfect espresso! Just the right strength and brew - will return"

    "reviews": "So far, the professors I've enrolled with have been excellent. When you need financial or tutoring advice, reaching the right people is not always easy.\nThe teachers are good, but the office workers take too long to respond to students' emails or phone calls.\nI had the biggest problems at this college, particularly with the finance department. While you think you set up a payment plan for the semester, you realize you have not withdrawn any money from your account. The student offers a two-month payment plan instead of three months without informing you. It has happened three times to me. Don't judge a book by its cover: this college is a living hell. It is unrealistic to study there I finished my degree in mental health  counseling here this past year. While one can get a quality education here, I have to warn you that you are on your own mostly. If you are a self starter, put forth more effort than the minimum, and are also able to stay orientated with little input, this is a good college for you. And it is one of the least expensive colleges in the area. The largest drawback in my opinion was how on your own you were as far as getting a placement and keeping track of what you do and don't need. This is a college that gives you an opportunity if you really want another one to move on in academic life. The financial aid office never picks up the phone, they will play around with your money and your financial aid. they had be do a form 4 times, they are not responsible. I called many times to give a complaint they won't even let you talk. The professors are great. My issue is with the administration it self. They are not organized. My CC said I had a ($4,777) credit and I called and they said I don't, that there system is old and it shows that but I don't have the credit. That is very unprofessional. If you care about your money don't go here. I regret transferring here. I already transferred to a different school."

I ordered delivery as I'm staying at a nearby hotel but I highly recommend the food!!! I took a picture of the inside as well. Very filling. Mama Ana is a delightful neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot with real charm to it. Conveniently close to where we were staying for our trip to the area, it was on our radar and after looking at the menu we were all sold.\n\nI enjoyed taking in the atmosphere as I waited to order and I even noticed Mama Ana interacting with a family she seemed familiar with.\n\nI had the breakfast tacos and the pineapple smoothie. They both seemed SO FRESH. The winner of my party seemed to consensus be the shepherds pie, so that\u2019s something I strongly recommend. Love this place! Had to drop a review for Mama Ana\u2019s in Somerville after visiting again recently \u2013 what a transformation! The space has always been inviting, but now it's taken a stylish leap forward, adding to the already vibrant atmosphere. As someone who's pretty selective with food, I was over the moon to find out I could tweak my dishes without even asking. The chicken shepherd's pie was a cozy delight, while my husband jazzed up his chicken and cheese pastels with some corn \u2013 talk about tailor-made! But let's talk about the appetizer: mashed potato balls with chicken and cheese inside, all wrapped up in a crispy, flavor-packed shell. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! And the pomegranate iced tea? Best. Iced. Tea. Ever. Period. Despite not living close by, the food alone makes the journey worth it. Toss in top-notch service and fair prices, and you've got a recipe for a must-visit spot. Mama Ana\u2019s, you'll be seeing us again soon! Stopped by this small cafe and liked the quiet, cozy vibe. \u2615 They serve tasty traditional Latin dishes. The eggs Benedict and brie sandwich are both really good.

    "reviews": "This is a great gym and a great location. It's very spaced out and doesn\u2019t feel cramped. The equipment is new and well taken care of at the facility. The facility is very clean and safe. The locker room is very useful. Ill be honest here, this gym is not very great, the staff is incredible which adds a lot of value to my rating here, they keep the gym clean and do their best to assist with any questions you may have. The real issue comes to the actual equipment in the gym itself. The Gyms machines are not great no pec dec a bad leg-press and no squat variation machines make it hard to do a good workout. My main suggestion would be to remove some of the cardio equipment and add a preacher curl, and pec dec at the minimum. Beyond that there isn\u2019t much that can be done other than putting in higher quality equipment in for all the existing pieces because the space is cramped and poorly laid out. Personally I believe the gym here in eastie really benefits from being the only option for those who don\u2019t want to go downtown everyday and i hope that there can be improvements made to change this review to a 5 I\u2019ve been a member here for 2 years. The employees are great and the gym is always clean. However it doesn\u2019t seem like the owners invest anything in the business, machines (and the water fountain) that break go weeks without being repaired and they haven\u2019t added a single new piece of equipment in the time I\u2019ve been a member.\n\nIt can get very crowded and the layout with 4 Olympic racks and only 6 portable benches means that there is a bottleneck for most lifters. My suggestion would be to clear out some of the unused cardio equipment and expand the free weight area, perhaps adding a fixed bench or two. This would go a long way towards alleviating the crowding issue. Overall when I first moved to East Boston i had no clue what to expect when looking for a gym. Beacon hill had just opened when i moved last year and overall it has been a great experience. The staff is extremely friendly and although the space is small, everyone works together. As I say it\u2019s enough to get the job done. The manager Gio is a fantastic manager, extremely friendly and have had some fantastic conversations.I highly recommend anyone looking for a gym around here! This is the most festive location of them all. Every holiday and season celebrated. I am disappointed I was not hired as a group fitness instructor, but it was a good motivational push to get my Zumba certification. This location has the best Latino and house music playlist, just like the dancing nightclubs. Beware \u2013 the staff at this place is dishonest. They claim the tip isn\u2019t included, even though it clearly is. They also tried to charge me an additional fee when paying by card, as shown in the pictures. On top of that, the waitress hovered over me, watching to see how much I tipped, even though the tip was already included in the bill. I ordered half bottle and they should\u2019ve just pressed for a full bottle instead. I will never come back here. I wish I could give them 0 stars. BEST PLACE IN EASTBOSTON TO PARTY.... I wish I could give less than zero stars. They make up the rules on the spot. One bartender says no cards accepted, despite lack of notice on the door. Another takes cards. (Be sure to check your receipt for unapproved charges). Cash operated (IRS, take notice). The service leaves much to be desired, including the extremely rude security at the door. First, he said it\u2019s full (while letting in his buddies), when asked what is the wait time - he proceeded to say we can\u2019t get in period, and refused to speak any further English, completely ignoring us or not even making eye contact. If you do manage to get in, be prepared to wait for the single bathroom and then to get a drink. Oh, and their idea of a vodka soda is a shot and a bottle of soda water on the side. Avoid this place. They only survive being the only late place opened until 2, but I sincerely hope they get closed sooner or later and a more respectable place takes it\u2019s spot. \u201cI had a challenging experience with the security at this bar is a man without education . Despite following all the rules and procedures, I was not allowed entry because the place was full but i see how another people Can entry after my because he know them.I felt frustrated due to the lack of communication and courtesy from the security staff. I hope the establishment can improve their approach to entrance management for future visitors.\u201d Or the state Can close like in the past because there are not rules there Worse, terrible, scammers, I never write reviews about bars or restaurants. But this place forced me to do so.  My tab was $57 handed to the bartender a $100. Never gave me the change back. Everytime I asked her for the change. She acted like she is busy.  Literally she picked up the ice in her hand and put it in the cup for other customers. Terrible Terrible Terrible experience. I wish there is something below1 star"

    "reviews": "I ordered mac and cheese bites, and they were delicious. I asked the waiter to recommend something that wasn\u2019t spicy since I\u2019m very sensitive to it. He suggested the pulled pork, but it turned out to be quite spicy. I immediately turned red due to my sensitivity. Then, he brought chicken with a red sauce, which also ended up being spicy. While I don\u2019t mind a little spice, this was overwhelming\u2014my throat felt irritated, and even my boyfriend, who enjoys spicy food, found it very strong.\n\nOn the positive side, the brisket was good, though it arrived lukewarm. The cornbread was tasty, and the toasted buns were also nice. The Pepsi and water were great.\n\nTo conclude, the view is beautiful, but in my opinion, this place doesn\u2019t deserve 5 stars\u2014it needs significant improvement. Really good BBQ. I am very happy with the kids menu, they have a big selection. I appreciate you guys keeping kids in mind. I recommend getting the combos. The sausage was very good and you can\u2019t go wrong with the pulled pork. The best sauce was the spicy one. Great location you have a wonderful view. The service was excellent from the host to the server to the runner. We will be coming back. I\u2019m happy we tried this. Visited on a Friday evening, about 5:30. We were seated right away, and our server was prompt and very friendly. The view is terrific, and the smell of smoke in the air adds to the ambiance. The menu includes the standard  fare you would expect (ribs, brisket, burnt ends, and chicken) along with what I consider odd reaches (veggie patty, vegan hot bowl, zucchini salad). I will concede, however, that if they execute these outliers with the same conviction as the standard meat options, any non-meat eater who wanders in will be fed and happy.\n\nOur ribs and burnt ends were very good. The trio of sauces were solid, and the sides were a nice compliment. Good smoke flavor on the tender meats. Crispy fries, delicious baked beans with a surprise celery component that worked very well.\n\nBackside of the menu offered a large variety of drinks. A limited but nice desert menu was also available.\n\nThis isn't a BBQ joint. If you're a fan of fantastic BBQ served roadside down south, you'll understand.\n\nOverall, this is a nice, slightly upscale BBQ restaurant serving satisfying food at a fair local price.\n\nChecking on ingredients for food allergies, I reached out to the website for answers. Got a prompt reply from the owner answering my questions. We were also asked twice before our order was taken. LOVE this level of service. i don\u2019t know about this one guys. being from the south i thought this spot would immediately be a hit for me but maybe i just didn\u2019t order the correct things on the menu. the pulled chicken sandwich had a funny smell and taste. i\u2019m not sure if i caught them on an off day but i couldn\u2019t even finish my sandwich. it was very unpleasant. i\u2019m a huge coleslaw girl and this coleslaw was very mediocre. it wasn\u2019t flavorful at all. i also ordered a sweet tea and there was nothing sweet about it. usually at a bbq spot the sweet tea is a southern style tea. it tasted like a regular fountain drink. the french fries were okay. a bit overcooked. the flavor was nice. if they weren\u2019t overcooked i could definitely have enjoyed them. my eight year old usually devours his fries and he couldn\u2019t because it was too hard and some of them stuck together. not in the best way. despite the food the restaurant is super clean. the employees were pretty friendly and kind. my drink order did get mixed up but we were able to resolve it. the view of the water is breathtaking. i wish the food matched. it would\u2019ve been a perfect combination for me. i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll be going back. I'm afraid I have to tell my wife how I felt about the cornbread and butter bread dessert... it's a love i never thought I'd find, the food was so good it changed my worldview.\n\nThank you for making the world a better place.... Went here because I needed to kill sometime before an airport pick-up. The atmosphere is so nice. It's got a student / study Cafe vibe and it's great to hunger down and get some work done while enjoying their delicious beverages and snacks.\n\nEverything is prep fresh, I got a avocado toast sandwich and I saw them cutting and mashing those avocados.\n\nTheir drinks are phenomenal, I recommend getting the large because it is LARGE it comes in a 700ml Mason jar, I got the Iced Macha latte while I worked away at one of the table spots and was easily ably to plug in my laptop and get to work! I absolutely love this place! It's perfect for any time of the day\u2014whether you're grabbing a coffee, enjoying a delicious meal, or just soaking in the ambiance. The coffee is excellent, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is ideal whether you're alone, studying, or spending time with friends or colleagues. If you're in Eastie, this spot is a must! The horchata latte is quite literally the best latte in all of Boston & it is made with homemade syrup. The cafe itself is beautiful with flowers everywhere. I love working remote here. They also have 50% off day old pastries which is such a good deal I always pick up a bunch when I\u2019m there. Been coming here consistently for over a year. Coffee is dialed in consistently and the special seasonal drinks are well curated. Food is always delicious and flavorful. Perfect little spot in East Boston! I actually come by fairly often to do work. I have always wanted small businesses to succeed. The food taste, quality, preparation are all terrific. The coffee pours are also generous, in my opinion. I love the house flavors they offer.\n\nBut the one thing that turns me off this establishment is the vibe of the owner, and the menu concept. Customers don't like to be nickled and dimed -- it feels cheap and scummy. Raise the prices across the board and just absorb the fees with the overall price increase. Don't upcharge just for a cold version of a drink because it's a few measly extra oz. How would you feel if you had to, e.g. pay 10 cents for an extra straw, or imagine a 5 cent surcharge for using glassware(?!). Of course they don't charge for those things, but the emotions I feel are the same as *if* I were charged for trivialities. The narrow-heartedness makes me feel so unwelcome, and gives off an aura of stinginess and insecurity; the owner seems to have a chip on his shoulder and telegraph both entitlement and bitterness that he/his cafe isn't more recognized.\n\nThat's not how things work. The angrier you are at others, the less people will want to come. Self-reflect, don't be defensive.\n\nPeople respond to warmth, not cynicism. The reason why some businesses are beloved aren't even because they are the best of the best -- it's because they know & love the community they serve, and the community members repay in kind by tipping well, recommending the cafe to others, and showing it off to friends from out of town. Businesses ultimately operate with a human element, and to boil everything down to the smallest exchange is penny wise and pound foolish. What a cute coffee shop! I visited during December so the store was trimmed with holiday decor. My husband and I each had a seasonal beverage. I had the nutcracker latte and my husband had the cinnamon roll latte based on the signs at the store. Highly recommend both! If you are in the Boston downtown crossing area this is the perfect place to stop for a good cup of coffee or any other hot or cold drink. Instead of going to one of those big chain coffee shops you can enjoy a great coffee here at the same time do something for our community.  The coffee is really good and the staff are very friendly!! I found this coffee house because I needed somewhere to store my luggage before checking into my hotel, and they will do that using the bounce app! Super cool! While I was there, I got a delicious hot latte and sat to read for a bit! Such a cute place! Pretty good tea selection, nothing to write home about, but super yummy baked treats. Very cute vibe, and liked that they donate money to different charities every month! Great spot to rest while walking all over Boston! Good selection of coffee flavours and breakfast items. Service is quick and  the cafe is spacious and there are lots of tables for groups or solo travellers. Prices are reasonable too."

    "reviews": "I\u2019ve been going here for years and years. It\u2019s such a warm and welcoming community, with great classes. I particularly like the vinyasa and flow and restore to clear my mind and relax. When it\u2019s nice weather they tend to have some classes out in piers park where you can listen to the sailboats and water! It\u2019s so lovely. Absolutely love the point. Absolutely love having The Point in the neighborhood- how would I ever get a workout in otherwise?! The awesome thing is that I can make it work sometimes early in the morning, sometimes during lunch and other times after the kids are in bed.  The instructors are all amazing and sweet and they have all the supplies so I don\u2019t need to drag anything but myself out the door \ud83d\ude06 The Point Barre and Yoga has been a game-changer for me! In just a short time, I\u2019ve seen incredible improvements in my strength and flexibility. The classes are challenging, yet fun, and the supportive instructors make every session enjoyable. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the whole community is friendly and encouraging. My top three classes are Cardio Dance, Pilates Mat, and Strong Glutes Barre.\n\nIf you're looking to get in shape in a positive and motivating environment, I highly recommend The Point! I have been with The Point Studio EB for couple of months now. Signed up for the yoga classes but discovered a lot more. One of the classes offered is the Cardio Dance class on Fridays. I felt in love with the class and how it made me feel. I love to dance and this class gives me the best opportunity to work out and dance at the same time.  The teacher Jamie  Rossi keeps it interesting, inspiring and engaging with dance. I love her enthusiasm and caring attitude. Dancing with Jamie brings us joy and confidence. It\u2019s a safe place to be and express.\n\nI\u2019m grateful for the  Cardio Dance Class and Jamie. Thankful to The Point EB studio to offer this class. Highly recommend it! Eeeeee I love this place! Steph's Warm Yoga Sculpt Express class is always fantastic. Such a great mix of flow with sculpt. And her music is always poppin!\n\nI used to have bad neck and hip pain, but since coming to the Point weekly, it is all but gone!\n\nI've never belonged to a yoga studio before, and the Point makes me feel comfortable and welcome. The schedule is extensive and the price can't be beat! Small little hole in the wall for years in old Maverick square in \"Eastie\" East Boston of course. Nothing fancy just a good ole hangout for years. No Food, Basically beer wine and popular old fav's. Definitely a dive by dive bar standards and it's great! Cheap beers, wooden benches, and the right bartenders for the job! Best and most comfortable place for a $3.50 PBR draft as you wait on your company flying into Logan. Safe and clean but still a nice dive bar. Cash only and open late. Atmosphere: typical dive bar, lgbtqa friendly, in a great location\nService: surprisingly speedy/ friendly, even security treated us kindly!\nDrinks: supper cheap, mixed drinks were honest and bottled beer was the cheapest this side of the harbor!\nWould definitely make the hike back over the harbor with this as the final stop, we highly recommend! I stumbled upon this little gem on a recent trip to Boston. Walking distance from airbnb. Wonderful staff and guests. I received tips for local food and transportation (water taxi). Ms. Kim was a breath of fresh air. I'll definitely visit again next time I'm in town."

    "reviews": "A charming and inviting caf\u00e9 with a relaxed ambiance. The smoothies are freshly prepared, and the food is expertly cooked. The atmosphere is uplifting, with inspiring quotes and affirmations displayed throughout the space. The music selection adds to the positive and chill vibe of the establishment. Love the panini!! Coffee has so many flavors and the best is some of them are unsweetened, not from syrup, which means I can enjoy the flavors without too much sugar intake. So glad that I found this place and will definitely come back! Pleasant coffee shop in East Boston! The double chocolate muffin was super good. However, I had higher expectations regarding the bagels. I ordered the Eagle Hill BLT but I felt like there was more lettuce and tomato than anything else. I was ready to come back, mainly for the muffin. you can tell they make their food with love. the owners are super sweet and always have the warmest welcomes. this is one of my families favorite cafe. they have a little bit of everything. from breakfast sandwiches to smoothies and coffee. their pricing is also reasonable for the quality of food you\u2019re receiving. the aesthetics is so cute. it makes you want to sit and stay awhile. they even have a cute fire place. good thing it\u2019s not real because i would be there much more often. ha, thank you eagle hill. you\u2019re the perfect addition to our neighborhood. First time trying this spot! I ordered the Meat lover Two eggs, extra bacon, extra ham, cheddar cheese on a croissant. The bacon was crispy and fully cooked it was great, the ham was perfect, the  two eggs cooked perfectly light and tasty the cheddar cheese was melted and the croissant was lightly toasted! The sandwich was delicious it was a great choice! I also got Peanut butter banana coffee a iced large with an expresso shot it was very refreshing and excellent flavor! You have a new customer definitely will order again from here! Thank you! I am very satisfied from my first time experience at your restaurant! So hard to find a place that does Peanut Butter bowls and this one never disappoints. This is the only place I\u2019ve found where you can get genuinely fresh fruit bowls and smoothies all day and night. Being able to order a fresh smoothie bowl at 10pm is top-tier. I\u2019ve never had a single bad thing from this place and I\u2019ve tried a bit of everything. This is literally my family and i\u2019s favorite spot in East Boston, thus far. The owner is extremely sweet, friendly, kind and welcoming. They have amazing recipes that always hit the spot. They also have a vegan option panini ( Veggie burger , with no cheese) MUST try!  Their prices are just right! You can grab a sandwich, smoothie or bowl of fruit without breaking the bank. They also have a plethora of fruits and vegetables you\u2019re welcome to purchase. We love this farm stand !! I\u2019ll say this is the best place to have a breakfast in Boston. Highly recommended.  Everything is really tasty.  My favorite will be Mediterranean Avocado Toast.  Pure Power Smoothies. Went there for the first time today. Ordered the Power Grain Bowl. Was disappointed.\n\nWhile the size was substantial, it was largely made up of a bag of that brown rice and kinoa insta-rice bag that you put in the microwave for 60 seconds. The stuff you buy at costco. I have those bags at home and use them if I am too tired to cook or I have absolutely nothing left to eat.\n\nSo, paying $20 (including a small tip) for this \u201cPower Grain\u201d bowl was rather disappointing.\n\nSorry to say, I will not be going back. I loved this place. Last year ordered delicious sandwiches all the time. Eventually my friends began to order too. Last week I ordered twice and the chipotle chicken panini was awful. The first day I thought it was a one off but the second day it was the same. What happened? Did you change hands? Get a new chef? Both times I ordered the sandwiches were soggy, tasted terrible and just not the same. The food is expensive but it was always well worth it. Not anymore. Goodbye East Boston Farm Stand. Mochinut offers more than your average donut. Their chewy, less-sweet treats come in a variety of tempting flavors. I particularly enjoyed the Oreo, strawberry, and UBE flavors. They're all visually appealing and delicious. Every time we go out for dim sum we see this place, but are too full to eat anything else. Today was the day.\n\nThe donuts are amazing! The texture is chewy but light, but dense enough to be satisfying. We tried the blueberry (our favorite of the bunch), matcha, and Fruity Pebbles. All were great. $3.50 a donut, with slight discounts for buying more.\n\nWe really need to come back to try the Korean style hotdogs and the fried ramen.\n\nA nice little sitting area too. A mochi doughnut from Mochinut never disappoints! Had the matcha doughnut and it was elegantly decorated with Pocky. The doughnut itself had a good chew to it yet crispy on the outside. The bouncy and airy texture was pleasant. Overall, a well made mochi doughnut! There were also plenty of other flavors and boba as well. There are so many rice hot dog or doughnnut and drink combos to try that this place can be overwhelming. Once I learned that they had a fruity pebble doughnut, I knew it would be the first one I had to try. I should have gotten a milkier bev to compliment the pastry. It's a different style doughnut and though it might be superior to the run of the mill doughnut you will find at Dunkin, I don't know if it justifies the price of $3.5. Still, I'm probably going to try more. Just getta got those flavor combos right. The drinks, however, are rightly priced. $4.50 for a large filled to the tippy top and they put on that special puncture-ready paper with the sharp curvature straw. I'll be back to update my review with the next visit. The location is a bit inconvenient but it's more than worth it. If you've never had a mochi donut it's like extra soft fried dough. Lots of delicious toppings to choose from My favorite spin studio in Boston!! Everything about AXL is perfect - instructors, music, bikes, studio lighting, bathrooms. I have gotten all my friends to ride here and they love it so much too! Love AXL so much. Feels like a second home. The team is very kind and welcoming. The instructors are motivating and are great at coaching you through challenging workouts. The studio itself is very clean and I love being able to use the sauna after class. Axl is a addition to the neighborhood for spin enthusiasts!  The studio is reasonably priced, brand new -- and built to meet COVID safety specifications.  Right now (Aug. 2020) indoor classes are limited to 6 riders + 1 instructor. It feels very safe -- and the outdoor classes (see photo here from one such class) offer wonderful views of the city for free.  I've taken every instructor on the roster so far and they are all very good + the staff is nice.  TBH I wasn't so sure when they opened if this local studio (even though more convenient for me) would be able to truly tear me away from the other spin studios I have loved in Boston over the years (not that all are reopened yet, but still) and it has.  I go all the time + I don't feel an overwhelming urge to go anyplace else. Can\u2019t say enough about this studio and the AXL team! I first tried AXL in May 2023 and haven\u2019t stopped going since. The studio staff is welcoming and attentive, and I always look forward to each instructors\u2019 authenticity, positive energy, and challenging workouts in each class - and I especially appreciate their thoughtful playlists! Their studio is clean, they offer a variety of classes each week, class reservations are organized, and you can always count on finding a helpful hand when setting up for class.\n\nI hadn't tried spinning before AXL, so it\u2019s been a learning experience, but I\u2019ve never been more motivated to consistently try new things and push myself to do better in a group fitness class. AXL offers a supportive and fun workout environment, but it\u2019s also given me an escape when I need it, a reason to celebrate and be celebrated, and a never-ending challenge every time I clip in! I highly recommend AXL to anyone who asks (and even if they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll probably still talk about it \u263a\ufe0f) Love this studio! Joined as an unlimited member in October and love the classes. Instructors are great and always challenge me. The themes, challenges, and variation of ride styles keep things interesting and fun. The studio is a community and a wonderful place to decompress. I would highly recommend to anyone who loves spin and is looking for a great local work out or anyone who has wanted to give spin a try!"

Great lattes and pastries!!\n\nMy regular coffee spot is closed on Sundays, so for the past few Sundays I've come here and gotten an iced latte along with some pastries. They're delicious! I like coffee drinks to still taste like coffee (even if they have had flavor shots added) and Melo's knows how to make a tasty cup.\n\nI enjoy taking advantage of their pastry bundle sales, when they bag up 3 or 4 different yummy things and sell it for a couple bucks at the end of the week. Good stuff. Such a wonderful place for coffee, pastries, and imported Latin American cooking staples! The person working there was so lovely :) Great coffee. Even better employees. They source their beans from a local cafe, which is good. Never a bad experience and their baked goods are fantastic. Baked goods and hazelnut coffe is delicious"

I love the fact that it's open 24 hours 5 days a week. Highly recommended.\nI want to share how much I love Planet Fitness in East Boston, especially because of the amazing people at the front desk. Let me start by mentioning Luis and Julie first. Their professionalism and great attitude have made my experience at Planet Fitness in East Boston so much better.\n\nThey are both valuable assets to this company. I have also received wonderful and positive attitudes from Mikey, Tyrell, Devin, and Ximena. Their welcoming nature has made my visits to the club a pleasure.\n\nThe club is clean, and I love its setup. Thank you, Planet Fitness, for having these amazing people working for you!\n\nRob, the manager, fabulous. THIS PLACE WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY!!!! Do not open a membership here. I followed all protocols and sent a letter of cancellation and they continued to charge me and provide a million excuses that they \u201cdidn\u2019t receive the letter,\u201d even though I have friends who have had no issues at other gym locations with cancellation. After escalating to the regional manager, they still refused to refund me or provide good customer service. Absolute fraud and this place should be ashamed of itself. I\u2019ll be escalating this to corporate for the unauthorized charges. plenty of room even on busy days and definitely a cleaner cut crowd. Haven\u2019t been to all the PF locations but out of the three i\u2019ve gone to so far, east Boston one is definitely my favorite Just recently re-opened after renovation.\nThe space is nice with plenty of new machines, a specific 30-miute workout area/routine with a light to guide the timing, a stretching area, many bikes and treadmills. The cost is probably as low as it gets in terms of gyms honestly, so not a bad deal at all.\nFor a little more money ($25 instea dof $10) one gets access to some massaging chairs, tanning beds (bot sure why haha), and red light therapy machines. One also gets access to other locations worldwide and possibility to bring a guest, so really not a bad deal!\nEveryone gets access to lockers, bathrooms, and showers, but no towel service."

If you are an aviation enthusiast in the Boston area, this is a must-see. If you have a radio that can receive airbands, feel free to bring it. However, the best views you will get are planes taking off from Runway 22R and planes landing on Runway 22L. Make sure to check FlightRadar24 to see which runway they are using. Traffic can be a bit heavy at times, however, great views! No restrooms. Perfect spot to go to see the sunset behind Boston Great place for watching the airplanes. My son and I were there for a few hours. Don't come here to spot airplanes in flights. The airplanes generally land and take off via the other ends of the two runways (4L, 4R), or via other runways, so the neighborhood here is surprisingly quiet. According to the local residents, from here you may legally go straight to the field at the east end of the Bayswater street, though there is a fench to be bypassed and sometimes there are dog barks."

Tried their chicken and rice - absolutely delicious, and they included Sambusa with my order \ud83e\udd29\n\nFYI: Found the place inside MIT on the 2nd floor. Got a bit lost with maps, but called their number on Google, and they guided me in. The Google pics show another branch in East Boston( not sure if the East Boston spot is open atm ), but the new spot inside MIT is where it's at. Landed at Logan and went to look for Ethiopian.

Most of the reviews here seem to be for the now-closed East Boston location. I ate at the fast casual location in the MIT student center in Cambridge, and the beef biryani was fantastic. We had a layover at Boston BOS, took a free airport shuttle to get to the Tawakal Cafe and had biryani, spaghetti and fries for to-go. While waiting we were served some free cookies and chai. Food are great, generous portion, fries are out of the world. Service was great. Will definitely come back as again insha Allah. A great informal marina, with limited frills but very helpful staff and great slips for larger boats (and smaller ones too). The location is fantastic with splendid views of the Boston skyline, lots of ethnic and american restaurants within a ten minute walk, the best cider brewery in the US on site, many other great things and a ten minute walk to the airport shuttle!\nThanks Jason and Hayden Well.. i could say it has a great view for boston skyline view when piers park and other parks are closed. Just be courteous. No chair available to sit upon THE BOSTON HARBOR SHIPYARD IN EAST BOSTON HAS A LOT GOING ON THERE. IT WAS BETHLEHEM STEEL MANY YEARS AGO. THEY BUILT SHIPS THERE. NOW THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF BOATS THERE.PEOPLE LIVE ON THEM YEAR ROUND. THERE IS A RESTAURANT THERE. YOU CAN FUEL UP YOUR BOAT THERE. THEY DELIVER THE FUEL RIGHT TO YOUR BOAT. Had to help drop off a beam after escorting it from Port, Jervis, NY. Did not do business there. But the view was nice. It's interesting to see the dichotomy of gentrification against the few blue collar industrial businesses that are left at the shipyard. The white collar people resent the industrial businesses taking up space that could be used for more condos or apartments. Had a bit of an adventure getting there. I wouldn't advise walking in the area after dark if you can avoid it (location is towards the back of a shipyard and was relatively isolated - HOWEVER I did go in February, and most people don't walk around at night in February to begin with). When we arrived there weren't any signs outside except for a piece of paper taped to the wall indicating the main entrance (door was open). I included a picture of the do not enter sign that unfortunately wasn't there when we showed up. I was elected to journey forth into the partially darkened warehouse until I found a very confused looking employee who very kindly showed me and my friends to the right place and put up the sign.\n\nThe bar had a one flight per person per day policy, which makes sense to me since supervising drunk people surrounded by heavy, working machinery sounds like a nightmare. The cider itself was delicious, and there was a flavor for everyone.\n\nMy only suggestion is to please add more signage outside! My friends and I did think there was a 50-75% chance that we'd end up on a law and order SVU episode up until we were actually in the taproom. Not my first time to Down East but don't go often as its over 1.5 hours from us. Went over the weekend to meet up with friends who also drove over an hour to get there and was greatly disappointed that when we arrived they said we're limited to ONE flight per person. We've never encountered this in our prior trips so was a shock, especially as there is no mention of this on their website (which I did check prior to selecting Down East as the brewery to meet at). When asked they said it was \"due to liquor license restrictions\" which is false however the table cards said something along the lines of 'once you are done with your flight, please move along so we can accommodate more guests'. That makes more sense than a \"liquor license restriction\" which is made up as there are no limits of the number of drinks that can be served under a MA ABCC license. You go to any other brewery or bar in MA, they don't tell you to get out after 1 drink..... Its understandable to ask guests not to take up space if you are busy since the taproom is small but there were 7 empty tables. Lying to customers is not a good look for the staff, which are a direct reflection of the brewery. Just be honest and say you're a small taproom and want to ensure there is space for guests but you should also accommodate your current guests when its slow and there is no line.\n\nBesides the blatant lie from the bar staff, the cider is really good. Overboard Tropical was easily my favorite. I don't think any of us will be going back to the warehouse taproom and if we do return, it will strictly be for the outdoor summer pop up taproom, which has NEVER limited the number of drinks we could get or even limit it to flights only. I'm sure they'd cut you off, like any brewery/bar, if you got hammered but I don't mean it in that way.\n\n.....Hindsight we should have just gone to Trillium across the bay or Far From The Tree this past weekend. Live and learn I have been a fan of Downeast for a while. Their ciders are fantastic and have had great experiences at their tasting room. Today unfortunately was not one of those days. We drove an hour to be told we would be limited to one flight. There is nothing on socials or their website explaining the limits. We were told it had something to do with the liquor license but I suspect it has more to do with moving customers through quickly because the space is limited. I also suspect that is not an accurate statement because a reserved table there at the same time were able to receive full pours, multiple flights, and cider shots with the employees. I also observed employees drinking full pours while they were working. When asked why they were able to receive more pours and flights we were told it was an employee party and the liquor license limitation doesnt pertain to employees. It was a disappointing experience. Don't waste your time coming to the tap room. It's not worth it. Wait until the summer when you can get full pours at the outdoor pop up bar. As a longtime fan of Downeast Cider, visiting their cidery was a dream come true! Although the indoor section only offered one flight, it turned out to be a delightful experience. Sampling their diverse flavors while sitting by stacks of cans created an incredible atmosphere. The real highlight was their outdoor tasting area by the water. Watching the sunset while sipping cider in comfy chairs was simply magical. Don't miss out on the overboard option\u2014it's now my favorite! Crossing the river for this experience was definitely worth it!!! First, I'm surprised an operation as widely known as Downeast is running out of a place as small as this but, what an operation it is!\n\nThe tasting room is set up in their production warehouse (where every can of their cider comes from) and seats ~40 people or so. It's definitely an industrial feel and due to the space only 1 tasting flight is allowed per person (with 4 samples per flight). The coolest part to me was the opportunity to try experimental flavors and provide feedback about them as well as flavors exclusive to the taproom.\n\nWhile I'm not normally a cider person they had non-cider \"cider\" options that were really delicious, especially the bomb pop and orange creamsicle flavors.\n\nAnd if you want more than just a flight there is a place across the street that has their beverages available in larger quantities/sizes.\n\nDefinitely worth a stop in!"

    "reviews": "I was downtown for some meetings and wanted to get away for lunch while visiting Boston.  So glad I found Gallery Diner.  Great food and local atmosphere.  She said the hash was world famous and I agree it was great. Anthony Bourdain came here for a reason. The food was great. I mean... probably the best omelette I've had in years. The steak was incredible and the French toast was perfectly unique with its own flavor that was subtle and easy. Great bread. The whole atmosphere was made perfect by the eclectic celebration of exactly what makes this place special. The people were kind and made it feel like you were genuinely welcome and that they were happy we were there. Classic diner vibe. Feels like home. Friendly staff, food is traditional breakfast food - just the way I like my diner food! They also have great gluten free bagels. Also underrated lunch spot! Any place you have to queue with locals to get in has got to be good! Small and I mean small by today\u2019s standards, friendly, sit at the serving bar and watch the food getting prepared before your eyes. Great breakfast tehn walked over to the beach to walk it off! Worth a visit A MUST GO TO!\n\nThe Galley Diner is a family owned/run establishment that just feels like Boston!\nThis small but mighty diner delivers in great customer service and even greater food. Located by Castle Island, this place is great for a bite to eat and a walk along the beach."

    "reviews": "It is my belief that this Stop and Shop is collaboratively owned and operated by Mr. Krabs, Scrouge McDuck, and Montgomery C. Burns. Obviously I\u2019m kidding\u2026 in reality this place is owned by a bunch of Dutch Hollanders (Ahold Delhaize ) who scurry off to the bank (it\u2019s definitely windmill shaped) in their wooden clogs screaming \u201clekker pik!\u201d (seriously, look it up) as soon as you check out. The photo below shows $35 worth of groceries on 1/23/24. 4 sticks of butter costs $8. All jokes aside, find somewhere else to shop. I bought this bbq sauce yesterday for 10 dollars\u2026 didn\u2019t realize it expired over a year ago. The quality at this place is absolutely shockingly bad. They routinely sell rotten fruit and veg but this is somehow a new low at the pit of lows Store is a bit tiny. Prices are a tad bit higher due to being in the city. The online ordering and pickup is less desirable. Had to call every time I went to pickup my groceries. Expensive and produce is not great. Only real option in the area. They have an irish section which is fun I'm done with this place. The facility is grimy; the produce is shameful; and the help is surly.  The young woman taking inventory this morning with her feet on the meat counter -- see photo -- was enough for me.  The good citizens of Southie ought to petition Demoulas to take this over. The empanadas from the shared menu are delicious. My husband and I just wanted to chill and enjoy a beer (or 3) outdoors and this place was the perfect choice. Great service too! definitely going back with friends. We came from Europe and were only there for the St. Patrick's Day parade, very bad experience at the restaurant, we wanted to have lunch after the parade but...they didn't even ask for my documents while my 30 year old son couldn't enter without a passport (of course they weren't with us) so we were left without lunch. And on top of that, you still have to pay $20 just to get into the restaurant.\nVery disappointing A very nice place for food and drinks. Friendly service and delicious food. The steak salad was so good! The outdoor space is really nice with a lot of plants and flowers. Highly recommended. Roza\u2019s is The Cheers of Southie, where everyone knows your name. It has a great neighborhood feel!\nA great place to eat.\nI look forward to the specials being posted every week. The Spinach Dip is out of this world. Friendly staff who absolutely rock! Great spot for a Guinness too! First time here! We had a wonderful late lunch. Cocktails were great, they have all the classics. Atmosphere is so calming and aesthetically pleasing. The food was also very good. Overall great experience! We went here looking for a good place to eat and we are glad we discovered it. We were just finishing a skating training session and hungry, looked for a place with great atmosphere and food and this place ticked all the right boxes. The lamb and steak and frites were perfectly cooked, ambience great, salads with tasty ingredients and the simplest pizza were awesome. Recommend this for a charming cozy place with bohemian atmosphere and good food for pleasure chit chat. I\u2019m a first timer in Boston & because I was staying near the airport, a local friend recommended we try Petula\u2019s. It was awesome! I personally got a few oysters and the vodka tomato pasta & I genuinely haven\u2019t had a good vodka pasta like that in years. The oysters were phenomenal! I will be going back! Such a great dining experience at Petula\u2019s! Cozy vibe.. great food and drink options! Planning to come back and try their brunch! Definitely a neighborhood gem in South Boston! Food was absolutely amazing! The bartender was so nice and very attentive despite being the only person working in the restaurant. The restaurant itself was so cute and the perfect spot for brunch or date night. Fresh made bagels. Watch them being made. Hard to find street parking. Tasty but too much cream cheese. Tried a bagel sandwich from here because it is close to my work. The salt bagel was extremely stale and the egg on it seemed as if premade, then frozen, then reheated. Same for the hash brown on it. Nothing was fresh-gross. There are 2 spots in High Street Place that offer much better (and fresher) options. I am not sure why this place has such low reviews, because the bagels are phenomenal!! I have had BB before in Seaport, but I just tried this new location over the weekend with my boyfriend and we were NOT disappointed!! Coming from Georgia, where the bagels are not freshly made, I was super happy to get my hands on a real breakfast bagel! He got the traditional lox on the salt bagel, and I got the bacon/egg/cheese/hashbrown on the everything bagel. They were absolutely delicious!! No complaints from us on Better Bagels in downtown Boston. 10/10!! We found this bagel shop walking by on our way to another breakfast spot, and decided to go in to get me a bagel. So glad we did.\n\nI've eaten bagels from a different place every morning of our trip (today is the 4th day), and this was the best bagel I've eaten so far. I got a plain bagel with garlic scallion cream cheese and I loved it. They use the perfect amount of cream cheese (not too much and not too little).\n\nI didn't see the Google reviews until after I ate my bagel. This place is currently underrated. The staff were nice. They are not outgoingly friendly, but really it's a bagel shop, not a fancy sit-down restaurant. This was a great spot for bagels! They are fresh and they don\u2019t skimp on the cream cheese. There are not many pleasantries when you come in so don\u2019t expect much from that perspective but the bagels themselves are good! Chip went above and beyond by thanking me for my patience and let me know how appreciated I was as a customer, even though I waited only 60 seconds for my egg sandwich. Really made my day, super solid customer service from Chip. Would order again. Everyone was super nice and brightened up my day! I walked in this morning and Lisa at the register was so kind and friendly! The gentleman, Chip, also calling out orders was super nice as well! It was a wonderful start to the morning. All of the employees here are awesome! They\u2019re super friendly and very customer service oriented! I\u2019ve always had great experiences at Starbucks, employees are always friendly and drinks are on point. Finally I have been proven wrong. Everytime I\u2019ve entered this location it\u2019s miserable, drinks aren\u2019t even recognizable. Zero personality from the staff as well. At this point I\u2019d sadly say go next door to Dunkin. The staff did not greet customers as they enter the store, or when taking the customer\u2019s order. Not a hint of smile or engaging in a friendly conversation.\nTables are not regularly wiped, the espresso machines don\u2019t look clean, it\u2019s as if they don\u2019t walk around the store and see what areas need to be cleaned to maintain the store for customers. Inappropriate songs are being played inside the store, and I\u2019m certain they are not Starbucks approved.\nThe atmosphere in the store, the attitude the staff expresses is not acceptable.\nNot very much keeping up with the Starbucks Experience."

The warm yellow lighting that accompanies a modern, earthy, but rustic setting is great. I have no complaints about the service as you executed thoroughly on all the check boxes to ensure I was well taken care of.\n\nThe boa buns are great. the dumplings are great. The spicy chicken ramen was the catalyst that made me go \u2018oh wow\u2019 and then \u2018I need to give this place the time of day on a review\u2019.  The only reason the food gets four stars is because I feel like the sushi rolls are trying to do to much. That might be a personal take but at least the quality of the raw fish is good. Americanized sushi to say the least.\n\nI will be back. I recommend.\n\nYours truly, sac. had the rock shrimp roll, baby's blossom cocktail. we were there later I. the evening and the kitchen closed at 10. Service was still accomodating. We had: Nigiri salmon ; salmon poke bowl ; birria bau buns ; fresh start (with tequila) all very good. Priced decently. Well balanced drinks made by the bar manager.\nService was excellent.\nInside is decorated tastefully. Bathrooms need updating.\nParking not great. Fun little Asian fusion restaurant in the South Bay Area. The cocktails were great and the rolls were better. They were swamped the night we went so our dragon roll was delayed but they comped that and gave an additional free roll. Great customer service. The braised pork belly bao bun was out of the world !! I loved it !!! The chicken dumplings were sooo yummy, especially the Thai green curry sauce was incredible. The sushi\u2019s were average. Fam go to place for gourmet coffee. Great flavors, taste and service. Price is right.\n\nNeed to try the muffins that all look amazing.\n\nGroup had different flavors and all were very tasty and happy with the selection. Good Boston coffee spot.\n\nLocation is small just pick up. Needs some update. My friends and I we were waiting outside for some friends to grab some coffee, it was a little windy so we were by the door and a blonde girl rudely told us to move away from the door, accompanied by a hand gesture as if she were shooing away an animal.

I was a coffee shop manager for years and I never treated anyone like that in my life.\n\nTERRIBLE costumer service ! Energy here is very consistent. Employees have this artisty vibe and i dig it. They always make me feel invited, welcomed and comforted while conducting my business. I think this place has the best coffee in Boston, and the fact they make drinks right in front of you, I'm not sure if i should call them baristas or magicians because I'm amazed at everything i buy here. These drinks should honestly get bottled and sold everywhere. Trash iced coffee. The iced coffees tasted like they were spiked, they had a bitter/metallic taste.\nMight be some bad water or something.\n\nThe hot coffee was alright.\n\nFor what its worth the service was quick for the amount of people ordering.

    "reviews": "Love these guys! The best the store has run since opening!! The manager is awesome. The pharmacy is great. The weekday store associates are my favorite. I wish I could give negative stars. My Dr. called in a script for my upcoming surgery and I got a message from Walgreens Pharmacy that filling it was delayed with the insurance company. Then crickets. Nothing. I called days later to find out that the script was not filled and wouldn't be filled because they don't accept my insurance. They should have just told me this - pathetic! Would give zero or negative stars if possible. I had my doctor call in a prescription that can be hard to find after I called the store to check that it was in stock. I called the next day to confirm and spoke to an employee on the phone who said that they had it and I could pick it up that day. She even took the time to remind me about the pharmacy lunch break, which was nice of her. Unfortunately this was completely incorrect. When I went to pick up my prescription the next day I was told it had never been entered in the system and could never be filled at this location because of an individual store management decision as the prescription in question is a controlled substance. I cannot overstate how awful the pharmacist was during this conversation between saying that he didn't believe me when I said I had spoken to someone, asking if I was sure I spoke to a real person and not the phone tree as if I somehow wouldn't be able to tell the difference, and telling me that showing him my call history wouldn't change anything when I went to confirm that I had called the correct Walgreens the day before (I had). The conversation concluded with the pharmacist telling me to stop standing by the drop off counter because he needed to start closing the pharmacy even though this was more than 30 minutes before the pharmacy's stated closing time as I stood there trying to figure out next steps to actually get my medication. Don't go here unless you're okay with being called a liar because a store employee screwed up. My prescriptions are never ready on time. My prescription was supposed to be ready today at 1pm. I stopped by then and they said it would be ready in 30 mins. I came back at 6:45 PM and it\u2019s still not ready. The pharmacist was incredibly rude when I asked how this could be. I do not recommend! I recently visited Walgreens Pharmacy and had an excellent experience thanks to Emily, the pharmacist. She processed my order quickly and efficiently. Emily bent over backwards to ensure all my questions were answered, showing a level of care and dedication that made a big difference. Her sweet demeanor and professionalism were much appreciated. I highly recommend Walgreens Pharmacy and am grateful for Emily's outstanding service! Friendly staff, more clothes than homewares but have found some great kitchen items, excellent pricing - clothing some brand new with tags; American Eagle jeans $7, Anne Taylor Petite jacket $5 in excellent condition for work! love this location. half of my jeans are from here. and the staff are so nice! its kind of small but i always find good basics here. and theyre always playing good music :) First and foremost, prepare to dig. This thrift store does not sort any clothing by size, so you have to thumb through every single item to try to find something, and then you have to decide if you even like it. (They do sort by color, though even that wasn\u2019t well-executed.) It makes absolutely no sense to shop by color instead of size.\nDue to that, the sections are poorly organized. I constantly found the opposite gender\u2019s clothing in my section, even children\u2019s items too. The bedding section is a heap of items in a huge metal basket. What a mess.\n\nAnd if you are lucky enough to find a few clothing items\u2026you can\u2019t even try them on, because the fitting rooms are closed. (No explanation why either.)\nBut it gets better: they don\u2019t do refunds or exchanges, so now it\u2019s a game of risking losing money on clothes that don\u2019t fit but can\u2019t be returned. Absolute clown show.\n\nThe only reason why I didn\u2019t give just one star is because the sales associate was polite. I went in this place in hopes of supporting the community but I was wrong! The items were dirty, some of the items were missing pieces and the customer service sucks. They refuse to refund me back my money or give me credits. I have names. I need headquarters to contact me asap because I will be reporting this store. The lady who worked there was making fun of a gay man and laughing as well. Purchased several item\u2019s yesterday, couldn\u2019t try on instore so I took them home. According to the website returns are accepted within 7 days for exchange. The store refused citing people steal and Covid, both of which I am not guilty of. The store was rude and unprofessional. If you are looking to donate or buy clothes second hand, do not shop here. Don\u2019t even come here for water because they will let you die of thirst first. Absolute worst customer service experience ever. DO BETTER. My Diner is located inside of an apartment building with a small outdoor eating area. This place is the classic breakfast/lunch diner will great food and service. We came on a Saturday morning and were seated immediately out on the deck. We ordered the breakfast sandwich, southie omelet, and a stack of two pancakes. Great food I cannot wait to come back! Casual diner where the locals go. Large portions for a good price and quick service. Very busy during peak times. The omelette special was great, no complaints on the food.\n\nWould definitely recommend going here for an easy morning, breakfast or brunch if you\u2019re looking for casual, affordable, and good food. I ordered the vegan chickpea omelette. I don\u2019t find too many vegan bfast joints and Boston doesn\u2019t have a ton of options, so this was a great surprise. Ray was really professional, but also humble and laid back. A cool local spot on the 2nd floor, which I wasn\u2019t expecting to be such a big layout. Great traditional diner with delicious, homemade breakfast dishes, wholesome portions, and delightfully hot coffee. Enjoyed the pancake and a hearty homemade corned beef hash, neither disappointed, only impressed.\n\nService was friendly and plentiful.\n\nBright, charming atmosphere with a nice outdoor deck adds a nice touch (outdoor deck is closed in December, but I look forward to coming back in warmer times). Came to My Diner at the suggestion of my brother.  The restaurant was not far from the hotel I was staying at. Hostess was pleasant and got us seated quickly.  Restaurant is actually on the 2nd floor so have to take steps or the elevator up to it. There is outside and inside dining options.  The breakfast food was really good. The Belgian waffles and omlettes were a hit for my group! Restaurant has a small parking lot for customers and the rest is street parking! Good experience and will visit again when I come back to town! They need to figure out a system for the frozen yogurt. We waited over an hour for froyo and when it was finally called, another girl took it. They were too busy to even hear my compliant or respond to my refund request. I paid for froyo and ended up just leaving an hour later. I had a tuna sub which was very good. I ordered the small but what I got seemed large to me.\n\nI was disappointed that they don't have any fountain drinks. It's just bottles of soda, etc. in a cabinet. I always prefer drinking out of a cup. They don't have ice or cups.\n\nThe interior is plain and older, but not bad for a corner pizza place.\n\nThe gentleman at the counter was friendly and helpful. The chicken is delicious and a large portion. Very good. However the rice isn't pilaf it's rice with corn and peas. Wish that was listed i would've gotten something else. The white sauce is very fish pier reminiscent. I will order again without rice Village has been my go to takeout spot since I moved to Southie in 2018. My dad is also a long-term regular after having worked in the area for more than 15 years. Tonight, I called in an order and was told it would be ready in 20 mins. When I showed up more than 20 min later I was told it would be another 10. When I followed up 10 min later, I was told it would be at least another 10. When I let them know that I had already waited an extra 10 min, the staff was rude, had no sense of urgency, and acknowledged that they had not even started the order. When I told them that I wanted to cancel it they simply said sure and didn\u2019t apologize or try to make things right. I understand that they recently went viral online for their froyo, but if it\u2019s appalling that they would treat a regular with such disrespect. They could\u2019ve also given a realistic timeline. Will be taking my business elsewhere until I receive an apology. The price you pay for the amount and quality of food was on point. My burger and onion rings were better than Lola Burger, and my buddies meatball calzone was impressive. The guys running the place were great people. Will return. The place was fantastic. The staff was awesome. Everything was great came in there mid morning after Valentine\u2019s Day. Had the cheeseburger hash next time I\u2019m gonna have the hanger steak for sure. Food was great, friendly staff.  Not sure what the vibe is here. Came on a Friday night... There are allot of TV's on the walls, playing sports. Then we get a Saturday afternoon coffee house concert at 8pm.  Just an odd vibe...o and everyone looks the same.... But I think that is a neighborhood thing.  The smash burger was delicious.  The cocktails were good as well. Atmosphere was great. Had instant liking going in; nice wooden decor and a welcoming bear(?) that was memorable. Staff were so friendly! Menu had a relatively good selection of typical brunch. They did a great job serving items hot and freshly cooked. Had that pleasure of having a home-cooked meal served immediately near the kitchen, and I really liked how my Western Omlette had melted cheddar cheese inside and served while nicely hot. The potatoes for the side and the fried chips were VERY GOOD. Actually the side potatoes that came with my Omlette was my favorite part of the meal. Very well cooked, with a tinge of crispy surface, not salty but still a good balance of spices. Loved it. And the juice they served for our sparkling wine - seemed like real juice. Added sweet and tangy, refreshing fruity flavor, so I really enjoyed my drink. The donuts were not sweet (tasted more like pretzels) but they went well with Nutella. I found the Salad selection pretty typical and limited in choice, so did not get one since nothing stood out to me. But I wished there was a way for me to add more veggies, e.g. in my Omlette. Wonder whether there would be options to make things a little healthier (e.g. choice of Salad as side instead of default potatoes, though got no regrets). French toast was bit bland but the maple butter was tasty. Overall really enjoyed my time here. Came out satisfied both in my belly and spirit. Good brunch option in south boston, kind of an odd location not super close to much. Restaurant is large and would be good for larger parties. Staff sat us quickly with a reservation and our waiter was friendly though clearly busy. Food was nothing crazy but the fried chicken Benedict was bomb! Grabbed a late lunch here, was delicious. Asked the question but knew the answer, it is individually owned- a chain just can't do it this well.\nLunch, so didn't try the cocktails, but BLT (with at least 6 slices of bacon) and beet salad. Both were perfect portions.\nDecor is well done, this would be a great place for dinner... large enough and well spaced tables for an enjoyable evening.\nWell worth a stop of you are in the area. Love this coffee shop \u2615\ufe0f\ud83e\udef6 great customer service and atmosphere! Sandwiches are delicious! I can\u2019t say enough about the great atmosphere and kindness of the staff. Every time I order there is so much care that goes not only into making delicious drinks, but that the entire experience is great. Today Tyler hooked it up with an amazing latte! Thank you! Great place! Good coffee, good food, wonderful staff, nice very nice decoration. Face mask required and social distance very good handle in the place. The also have a rewards for your purchases. I think I\u2019m coming back soon \ud83d\ude0a Tyler (south Boston) makes the best coffee ever,  he puts in the love it need just for it to be over the top. I\u2019ve gone to multiple other locations and they do not stir the caramel into the coffee.\nThat\u2019s what makes it top of the line here with Tyler!! Great place to study, work, bring a date\u2026 but please tone down music volume a bit. The thing about all Southie establishments that I don\u2019t like is blasting music - makes it difficult to do any of the above. Hence less stars! Also, please go easy on air conditioning."

    "reviews": "I had heard about this place having Oyster specials on Monday somewhere, and being our first time in Boston we had to go to compare West vs East coast. This place was fantastic all around. Really cool location in a downtown feeling area, huge open space indoor and out. The staff was really friendly and quick service. We tried a few things off of the main menu too, but the oyster deal is too good to pass up. We found our that our 2 and half year old enjoys fresh oysters much to our amusement since we get them often back home in Morro Bay. Tacos were a good size. We got the trio of salsa which was delicious. Definitely a fun spot to try out. Brunch here was DELICIOUS! I gave it 4 stars for atmosphere just because it gets super loud and busy in the evenings, but brunch was perfect. Got the breakfast fajitas with chicken and my partner got the crunch wrap. A pretty good taco spot. The tacos were a bit pricey but the food was good overall. Some of the tacos were average, about what you would expect. However, the coconut shrimp and beef barbacoa tacos were fantastic and I would highly recommend. We came on a Monday, so I got to try the $1 oysters, which were good as well. Good service, and not too noisy. Overall, a good experience and I\u2019d come back again. Did take out- pretty good quality tacos and yummy. Enjoyed the guacamole with seasoned chips as well for entrees had tacos, steak corn salad, and Eloite with rice. Unfortunately steak was missing but they were able to correct it. Overall pretty good Mexican food Yeah, not sure if it was an off day or that\u2019s just the way it is. The food didn\u2019t have an authentic taste and was missing some spices. The service was great, sat outside, yet inside there was live music which is cool. Feels more like a cool bar to go for drinks and have food on the side. Good food. Love the fact everything is vegan. Recommends the hummus and pita to start with. The pita is amazing. Also the Hot Honey Ranch Crispy Chickn sandwich was very good. The service was very nice too. The staff was quite well behaved. Definitely going back again. Lulu Green gave us the BEST vegan meal we\u2019ve had anywhere in any city!\nThe apps were beyond delicious! The warm, seasoned pita bread was honestly the best pita bread we\u2019ve had, the beets were phenomenal, the brie was so creamy and the cocktails were a treat!\nMy husband ordered the Mushroom Short Rib which was nothing short of magical and I ordered the Pasta alla Vodka (which had a vegan ricotta that I\u2019ll never forget).\n\nTheir chocolate chunk cookie was flavorful and delicious!\n\nI would fly back to Boston just to eat here again. The food was mind blowing!\n\nJust purely amazing! Locals know that losing both True Bistro and Littleburg in 2023 was devastating to the veg community. Lulu Green has really stepped in to be the best spot for a really nice dinner, a perfect lunch, or a brunch worth waiting all week for. Everything on the menu is creatively and thoughtfully seasoned and prepared. I try to get something different whenever I go, and I\u2019ve never been disappointed.\n\nThis place has great variety on the menu and we frequently choose it for date nights as well as work and road trip to-go meals. It was my husband\u2019s pick for his birthday dinner this year, and we were delighted with everything we got.\n\nI hope this place is around for many more years. Please go and give them your support, and bring your friends and family. Must try! So as a vegetarian I was so excited to try this restaurant. We even brought a beef farmer who LOVED the food so when they say everyone is welcome they mean it! This is beyond what I was hoping for\u2026 this is next level plant based food that tastes sooooo good! The mushroom short ribs, the popcorn carrots, the Brie cheese, THE BREAD, the warm blueberry pie the list goes on and on! I cannot says enough about the meal I just had. Beyond the outstanding food the chef prepared, the staff was so amazingly attentive and kind, guiding you through the menu and making recommendations based on your tastes. They never let a drink be empty. The chef even came table side to check on how we enjoyed the meal. Everything is so thoughtful down to swapping out the cutlery in between courses. Hands down THE best vegan restaurant I\u2019ve been to! This spot is a must see when in Boston. Great Recipe and serving portion. Good Drinks. Felt the place bit off with lighting though. Making Reservation would be helpful. My kind of pizza place- no frills, large portions, quick service, affordable prices, good pizza.\n\nTried and would recommend the bistecca 16 in and cajun fries (1 portion which was a hefty bag) and ate at the tables outside. We had 2 people and plenty of leftovers. Great experience!!! Food was amazing! I'm only in town for a few days and I will probably be back daily! The Buffalo chicken pizza ans the Chicken Parmigiana Grider was amazing! Definitely could have split it with two people. Warning: fries are a sharable as well! Great big portions! The best pizza around here . I wish I took the some pictures but I just had to eat before my phone because I couldn't resist.\nAndi and Ari have been in the business for a long time and there is a reason why they still going .\nDon't forget to check the coffee place next door \ud83d\ude09 Place was decent.\nFood was good.\nTables were kinda dirty for 1120am\nBut not horrible Best pizza my husband and I have ever had! We are from Florida, MA which is in northwestern MA in the Berkshires. We were in town for a wedding, ordered pizza and are still talking about the chicken broccoli alfredo pizza more than anything! We are headed back to Boston for an appointment with a doctor this week and are already planning our meals lol. Highly recommend! This place was great! They have a lot of variety to choose from. My boyfriend and I went here multiple times during our stay in Boston because we couldn\u2019t get enough of it. Some of the highlights were the coconut latte and the chocolate croissant. Not to mention the staff were really friendly, and remembered us!\nMy only complaint would be the noise, it can be a little bit overwhelming with the noise coffee grinders and the music in the background. But other than that this place was amazing. Would definitely recommend!!! The cappuccino and breakfast sandwich were great! Nice atmosphere and very friendly service. Wonderful little cafe with a variety of sweet and savory pastries. Generous slice of cheesecake. Excellent iced coffee. Very reasonably priced. The meat/cheese pastry was so good I bought several more to take with me to the airport. Cute and cozy coffee shop with great customer service. Delicious latte & breakfast sandwich. The cranberry orange scone (dry and bland) was not one of my favorites therefore the 4 stars for food. Very nice place inside. The coffee is great, the pastries are delicious and the staff were very pleasant. I really cant say anything negative. I cant wait to go back. This will be a regular spot for me now.

A dive in the truest sense of the word. Came here for the pool, stayed for the affordable beers and good company. Cash only, and the tables are free. Unpretentious and a ton of fun, swing by if you need a break from the seaport. Asked for a jack and coke - the barman took a pint glass, filled it 3/4 full with Jack Daniels and topped it off with a splash of coke\n\nDon't remember the rest of the day but I'd go again Very nice neighborhood pub. Nice music and vibes, good beer, cheap prices, you can bring/order your own food, pool tables, darts.. I like it. Amazing place to have a drink! Forget the stereotypes, friendly regulars and great staff. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the bar is def a stereotype, but it\u2019s an amazing time! Liked the bar very much.  Left too drunk to remember details"

    "reviews": "I initially thought this place was just another hotel bar but the food here truly hits the spot. Came here after checking out my room for a last minute brunch.\n\nMy friends and I wanted one last taste of Boston and shared the Lamb Meatballs (I couldn\u2019t resist and took a bite before taking a picture) and Lobster Rolls as a table. I do wish the meatballs were a bit larger. For my entree I had the Po Boy and a mimosa.\n\nThe restaurant gives a lowkey vibe that would be good for both dinner and/ or lunch. Service was quick and we were lucky enough to be seated upon walk in. The place was packed! We went there for dinner on Friday and it was really good! They found a table for us even though it was very busy.  The food was delicious and cooked very good.  We really enjoyed it! We ate here because it was conveniently located in the hotel after a conference.  The front bar half of the restaurant was closed, so it felt off walking through to get to the dining room. The food was, to use my kiddos term, mid.  The burger wasn\u2019t as good as a five guys or chilis burger, it was just a burger.  Not good, not bad.  My honey had the Caesar salad and said it was good. For what you get, it was overpriced, but it was in a hotel so I guess that\u2019s to be expected. My husband and I ate here during our trip and it was a great find especially during the holidays creating a joyous atmosphere. Everyone was great from the front host to our waiter. The food was outstanding and we will definitely be back in the future! Ended up eating here a lot during our stay,  due to a friend having Celiacs and this place had a very accommodating menu. Everything I had was very good, with the beer battered fish and chips being the strongest.  The cocktails were better then average as well.\n\nThe best part was my friend was able to enjoy multiple meals out without suffering from their celiacs, which is S class service in my book. Service was great. Friendly fast and attentive! Sandwich flavor was not great. Similar to subway.\n\nProbably would only visit again in a pinch .\n\nClean restroom and dining space. Big fan of their new jalape\u00f1o ranch chicken wrap!! Might be replacing the bootlegger as my top choice. In addition to their sandwiches and wraps another highlight is their jalape\u00f1o chips, big fan and great crushed up in any sandwich for a bit of a kick.\n\nI typically get Jimmy John\u2019s delivered, but I went to the store to pick up for the first time in a while and service was just as fast. There was a unique smell when I walked in that bothered me a bit but otherwise place was clean and there was no line. May stick with their \u2018freaky fast\u2019 delivery, but either way I\u2019d highly recommend Went for lunch during NAR conference and I was so happy with it, I went back the next day. Fast service and the bread is delicious. Just not what it used to be. The bread keeps getting slimmer and less doughy. The delivery meat is not as fresh or tasty as it once was. It was a let down. I used to say jimmy John was better than jersey Mike's but jersey mikes deli meat is ten times better. First time order here because of a promotion. Much better than subway, staff was nice. will come back again when I\u2019m in the area\ud83d\ude0a Not what I'd expect from a chain like Dunkins. . don't eat there often so maybe it always this bad? My food was somehow cold and burned, ?? Service was meh, very disengaged. Was cloudy after a meeting so went for a bite. I mentioned a wrap, didn\u2019t mention what type. Arrogant employee who wouldn\u2019t listen to anything more than twice, super judgmental, and genuinely should not be in a consumer facing role. Didn\u2019t clarify anything, brushed me away, and continued to listen to music or whatever on her earphones.\n\nFood was typical normal Dunkin\u2019. The guy that's here solo right now, 12/31@ 5:30am is awful. He has 0 respect for customers, doesn't know the items you sell, and moves at the rate of a drunk toddler. The rest of the staff is awesome! But this one guy is a total jerk everytime I see him. Slowest DD I have ever been to.  I can only estimate that I waited 30 minutes to have my order taken. Thank God 3 people left ahead of me or who knows how long it would have taken to place my order.  I learned that it was the specialty coffees and breakfast items that were slowing them down so I changed my rder to doughnuts just so I could get out of there.  Terribly understaffed. The girl walked around like she had some sort of attitude... never acknowledged any of the customers in line. Frankly I have no idea what she was doing there.  The poor guy working with her seemed to be doing all the work. He was doing his best to keep up but he was clearly drowning. The place is tight... don't expect to be able to sit in there... there's barely enough room for 12 customers. Food get a 5 star but .5 stars for service (hire some staff) and .5 stars for the total lack of atmosphere. Do not place your orders there, they only leave one person working in the afternoon and he spends up to more than 15 minutes serving a single person. Your order takes a long time to be ready. What bad service they have there.\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15 This location has completely turned me off from Starbucks. After waiting in line for 20 min, they opened mobile ordering. I stayed in line for another 5 min and placed my order at 7:26am. By 7:58am, I left after receiving only 2 of my 5 drinks. I waited over a half hr while mobile order after mobile order was fulfilled, with no cafe orders being completed. The place was complete chaos. A mobile order placed at 7:40am should not be completed before a cafe order placed at 7:26am. I also paid $10 for my macchiato. The manager handling the orders just peaced out in the last 5min of my wait. Avoid this place if you want to maintain your sanity. Keep in mind that this is a licensed Starbucks location in the Westin adjacent to the convention center.  If you\u2019re at the convention center and their coffee just isn\u2019t cutting it, you\u2019ll want to cross over the sky bridge and take the elevator down to the lobby.  Starbucks is just to the right of the bottom of the escalator.  Think of this location as the equivalent to the Starbucks in your favorite Las Vegas casino.  Busy and expensive, but the service is good, they allow you to earn and redeem rewards, and the location is well appointed when compared to many other licensed Starbucks stores. Just behind these escalators, you'll find the Starbucks inside the Westin Seaport Hotel.\nNow, Starbucks might have good beverages, but their sandwiches are really not worth eating.\nEverything is pre-prepared (somethings months ago like with the pastries) and heated.  The flavors are less than enjoyable.  I'm not sure how the company gets away with referring to what I received as a \"croissant\".  The tiny amount of ham and cheese included was not worth the price.\nThe Tomato and Mozzarella on Foccacia had me searching for both the tomato and mozzerella but there was plenty of strange green sauce on it that tasted like mustard that had gone bad.\nHOWEVER - this Starbucks has an good staff who shouldn't be blamed for Starbucks bad food.  They get the orders correctly to the patrons.  They are pleasant Terribly slow. Took 45 minutes to get my coffee the first day and 30 minutes the second day. Only prioritize online orders. Mobile ordered. There is no organization at this store. Waited over 20+ min for a sandwich and this is what they gave me. Wonderful and friendly service. Crispy golden wings that were perfectly seasoned. I could easily eat a bucket full of these wings! Compliments to the chef. Visited the place for a quick dinner as it was raining outside and we didn't want to go out. The menue offers choices of starters, salad, breads, sandwiches, main dishes. We were served by a very friendly staff - Jake, as Jake tried to accommodate our choices and preferences. Other staff members were also pretty friendly. We received great services at Birch Bar. Cute lobby restaurant in the Westin Hotel. The prices are steep, but that is expected for hotel restaurant and bars. The food is good and the service is great! The salads are good but adding protein is an additional $12-$18.\n\nThe wings are great and the portion size is generous. The soft pretzel appetizer was good as well. Came down around 5:00 on a Monday while staying over the weekend plus a few days. Opened a tab and had a few drinks. My friend came by eventually and we moved to a table from the bar. We kept drinking, but eventually an older gentleman that I assume was the manager came by and ran us off as if we were just taking up space or bringing down the vibe of the bar. We weren't inappropriately dressed or being unruly, etc., but the gentleman made us feel very unwelcome even though we were paying customers. The actual bartender and staff were great, the drinks were good, and the prices weren't bad either, we just had a very cold welcome from management. I had the fried calamari, it was very good. Soft and not chewy!\nMy friend had the flat bread, it wasn't very good.\nLater I got the fish and chips which was good too. City bar has a great atmosphere. They have very nice decor and ambiance. The staff are very friendly. The food is delicious. There's a good amount of variety on the menu. Everything is a bit pricey though. I've been to City bar several times now, and it's always good.  Super fresh and cooked just right.  The seared arctic char with shiitake mushrooms was delicious (not sure if it's still on the menu).  The Cioppino is tasty as well.  Always a line, but worth it if you have the flexibility.  One of the best seafood restaurants in Boston. The drinks were fine, atmosphere was fine, but heres the issue:\n\nThe bartender that night, unsure of who exactly,  EASILY over-served everyone, and showed no concern.\n\nOne of the people who was over served, walked up to my group, and tried to take my drink from right in front of me, then tried to take my friends drink.\n\nAll that happend while the bartender AND manager were watching, and they did absolutely nothing.\n\nI talked to the manager, explained the situation as if he DIDNT see it, and all he did was replace my drink after I asked him to.\n\nIt was nice that he replaced my drink, but he didnt seem happy about it, and didnt do anything about the overly drunk guy trying to take our drinks.\n\nThe bartender didnt care, and neither did the manager.\n\nFor this reason alone, I would NOT recommend this bar.\n\nEDIT:\nI am changing my review just a bit. After originally writing the review, and rating only 1 star, I was reached out to by the team via email. They asked for more details, took my review and experience seriously, and showed a genuine interest in making sure my specific experience would help to improve their establishment. I cannot rate 5 stars, based on the way it was initially handled, but I can definitively say they take it seriously, and it was worth looking into. What's done is done, but I'm confident nothing similar would happen again at this bar! They did not have 2 items we ordered and at first gave us half of a meal. The food after that came quick and food was good. Service was odd and tried to joke around, but it wasn't funny and sort of rude. Some of the waitrs were nice though. Went in 4.8.2019 at night and wasn't busy at all. Both waitress and bartender just talked and ignored me while i waited to be served.  What a disappointment. Left and informed hostess. Service needs improvement.  Dont waste your time simce they dont seem to care"

    "reviews": "The food was 5 stars, but our server seemed to lack experience, and personality!\nWe started with oysters. They were delicious! (Server brought a couple first instead of a couple dozen...and had an irritated response to it). Our entrees were all fantastic and perfectly cooked. I had the swordfish kebabs, with sauteed spinach and brusselspours. So amazingly good!  Unfortunately our server lacked interaction and pleasantry. She seemed quite overwhelmed. The legal test kitchen is a restaurant and sports bar in one place. The tv screens are not that big, so it\u2019s not really annoying. The service was good and the staff friendly. The food was like okay, not the best I ever had. Therefore the prices are a lil bit high but okay for dining in Boston. It\u2019s a good restaurant but I think I would not come again. Spot is premium, friendly and knowledgeable staff, me and a co worker ordered the LTK Tower (all was good except the clams) and the lobstaaa Mac n cheese.\nI have to mention the have a special lobster meat marinade in special mix (fantastic with crisp clean finish) I thought one of the ingredients was Saki. Food was awesome. I got the Halibut Steak special and the Strawberry Shortcake as a desert and they were served properly and on time. Once again, you have to try their red sangria at least once. Legal Test Kitchen is a local chain arround the Boston area that's famous for its seafood. We had to have to clam chowder and the lobster roll (seasonal price).  Chowder was nice and thick with a good amount of fresh clams and not too salty.  Good amount of oyster crackers too if that's your thing.\nLobster roll came with lightly toasted and buttered bread and the lobster itself was meaty and fresh.  Definitely not overcooked and not rubbery at all.  Seasoned nicely and came with really good crunchy fries.  The only thing with this location is that service can be a little slow sometimes and it would be best to make reservations. My fiance and I love coming to seaport social! The staff is attentive and very friendly. The owner is dedicated to keeping the food, service, drinks and vibes all top notch. Although we love to say this is our \u201cneighborhood bar\u201d, as it is reasonably priced for the area and always reliable, it\u2019s far from boring or outdated!! When friends are in town, stopping here for drinks and/food is a no brainer. Also, the music is always on point! You will catch yourself swaying or singing along while you\u2019re there. Eustace(host) was such a vibe full of positive energy and made it such a good experience. Also the food was delicious, I will be back!\n\nUPDATE\nOn 3/24/2025   I had someone get takeout for me (Brussels sprouts, crispy cauliflower) $25  I wish I had  a picture (4 small pieces of cauliflower and less than a half of serving a brussels sprout) Dining in I have always had a good experience but take out \ud83d\udc4e maybe I will try one more time \ud83e\udd1e Had one of the best burguers I\u2019ve ever had! If you are in the area, do try the Smash double! Also, the environment is great with good music. Mediocre food that up-charges because they have a good location. 7 pieces of microwaved chicken tenders for $14. Very light layer of breading that separates from the meat like a dirty sock. $5 tacos with good amount of filling, but seems like a grocery store taco made haphazardly. Overall vibe of Kroger ready made meals.\n\nNobody at the front to greet ( as you can see from picture ) so we just walked in and try to find somebody to seat us.\n\nIt exists to prey on concert goers and silly tourists. Had a great lunch here! Not too expensive and delicious food. We started with the crab cake tater tots which were decent. They came with a homemade tartar sauce, and although the consistency of the interior was a bit softer than expected, but it was still good. I got the fish and chips, and not only was it a hefty portion of fish, but the fry was perfect. The fish was flavorful and had a great fry to it and the French fries were\u2026 all completely eaten by the end. The people I ate with split a salad and the pulled pork grilled cheese (which I tried and it was excellent!). Solid. It's hard to find a good coffee spot but Blue State exceeded my expectations. Good coffee. Great iced latte.  Non dairy options and a nice staff. The barista rang my order wrong, didn\u2019t listen to what I ordered and I had to watch to make sure he put the extra shots in I ordered. I also had to have my drink remade because the barista shorted me two shots. Not impressed with this place. Nice gourmet coffee shop with good espresso-based drinks and light snacks. I'd rate this the best shop I found in the seaport area.  The location is a bit tricky to find since it's in an office building, though you can enter it directly from a walkway behind the building (by the stairs leading up to the Seaport Hotel). Be forewarned there is no seating in the shop itself. Super friendly baristas with great coffee. I hung out reading a book for about an hour and a half and had great conversation with the baristas about the coffee shop's charitable mission while enjoying 2 cups of light roast coffee. Will definitely be back! I am always happy with my experience at this Blue State location. The Staff really makes an effort to remember their frequent customers. They always remember our name and have a smile on! Decent place. Vibes are good. Went as with my with group and we got a bunch of things. I got their:\n\nNachos, tampequerina (may have misspelled) but it's steak and other stuff. Honestly, the food felt bland. Not much flavor. I asked for medium steak and it was very tough. Should've done medium rare.\n\nFor drinks, got blood orange and spicy cucumber. I couldn't taste orange in the first drink and it was quite bitter but not that bad. Spicy cucumber was delicious. The rest of the group got bunch of things and folks were happy with their food and drinks. I liked the Fajitas that I ordered. We went there with a group of colleagues and everyone enjoyed their food. The ambience was great and so was the service. Definitely recommend. We stopped in after walking past this place several times to our hotel. We only wanted an appetizer and drinks. The restaurant was busy so we sat at the bar. We ordered our drinks and some chicken nachos. We waited for about 45 minutes before our nachos were served. We weren\u2019t upset but just a but puzzled to see it took so long to get an order of chicken nachos out. The nachos were ok but in all honesty they were nothing special. Our server was great shout out to Nicky . Food was yummy didn\u2019t wow me but was good ! Service and atmosphere was very pleasant will try the drinks next time As a Latina- the food was very bland. GF options for sure. We ordered steak tacos that were supposedly GF but I took one bite of it and did not feel well- so it\u2019s questionable. I had to add lime and hot sauce to try and fix the fresh guac. Everything is overpriced so I would have expected to at least get food quality food. Super disappointed. The bussers were also super sweet and attentive. The manager (?) with blonde hair was not super welcoming even after I said something to her in my attempt to be helpful and her response was not nice.\n\nHowever - our waitress Gavi was lovely and super attentive. Me and my boyfriend just visited Morton\u2019s for the second time. This time, we were celebrating our anniversary and I can confidently say that I have not had such a positive experience dining anywhere else. They went above and beyond to make our night special. They had the table set up for us with a special note and a heart on the table before we arrived. The whole time they treated us like royalty. They took a beautiful picture of us and printed it out. The food both times was 10/10. You pay for the quality and experience. Danielle was our server and she made all the difference. We will request her every time going forward. She is hands down the best server we have had at ANY restaurant ever!! Thank you Morton\u2019s for everything you do. Came here for a birthday/ anniversary combo and everyone was very friendly and kind. They called my s/o beforehand to help create a 'custom' menu and make our night even more special. Steaks were cooked perfectly, sides, and mocktails were delicious! We were offered a complimentary dessert as well. The waiter was very attentive and accommodating,  fantastic service. Atmosphere was also top notch but just a bit loud. The food was very good, however for the price they charge, very expensive,  I was expecting better.  Not saying the food was bad, it was very good but less than I was expecting for such a place. The beef was slightly over done, so was the lobster,  Good, but I feel,again at that price, should have been perfect. Very busy, lots of people, but again there was that feeling it could have been better. Morton\u2019s in the Seaport is everything you want from an upscale steakhouse: refined ambiance, stellar service, and unforgettable food. Add in the waterfront backdrop, and you\u2019ve got one of the most impressive dining experiences in Boston.\n\nI went all in with the tomahawk bone-in ribeye, and it was worth every bite. Massive, beautifully marbled, and expertly seared\u2014the kind of steak that makes a statement when it hits the table. It was rich, juicy, and full of deep, smoky flavor, with that satisfying tug you get from a perfectly cooked ribeye near the bone.\n\nThe sides held their own too\u2014lobster mac & cheese was indulgent and creamy, and the creamed spinach was classic and comforting. Even the warm, buttery bread they bring to start is dangerously good.\n\nService was spot-on: attentive, knowledgeable, and just the right amount of formal without feeling stiff. Our server made the whole experience feel elevated but still relaxed.\n\nWhether you\u2019re out to impress, celebrate, or just treat yourself to a steak worth remembering, the tomahawk at Morton\u2019s Seaport is it. Five stars, no question. If you are looking for high quality food and an amazing atmosphere then Morton's is where you need to go. The Ahi Tuna Poke was amazing as a starter and then we went with Morton's Classic Filet Oscar 8 oz. and the Ora King Salmon and everything was fantastic. Highly recommended!! I just left this location minutes ago. A while back I walked in & asked for a Kids meal. I was ONE of 2 Customers in the  ENTIRE Restaurant, looking directly at the contents to make a Kids Meal. I was told that the order had to be placed Online~~\nFast forward to today. I placed my Order Online;  went to get it with my Phone in hand to show my Order. I get there...\n\" Oh, sorry, someone took your Order\", I was told. The Employee pointed at The pick up area & told me to place my Order in the Line.\nI start to do so.... Online they asked if I wanted chips and a Kid's drink, I selected them. While ordering in the line, I asked for my chips & drink (Apple juice)..... An Employee says to me, \"Did you pay for this Online?\", in front of everyone -- Like I'm the Thief!!!???\nQuestioned did I pay, while holding my payment Order visible in my hand.\nWait... Wait .. A Literal THIEF has stolen my Order! I walk in with my Order AND PROOF OF PAYMENT on my Phone and I AM THE PERSON INTERROGATED?? HUMILIATED???\nI wonder if the THIEF was questioned before stealing my Order!\nTo add insult to injury, when I got home, I looked at my Order & they didn't even bother to heat my Quesadilla! Disorganized, TRASH, humiliating Service! Rude staff, it took them 5 minutes to understand i wanted a burrito and not a bowl\u2026. The burrito at the end was cold and falling apart, wrapped up like an amateur.\nFirst time was disappointing and today even more\u2026 worst chipotle.\nThe good side is the honey chicken, really good. This is by far the worst Chipotle I have ever been to\u2014anywhere in the world. The employees working here on weekdays at lunchtime are unbelievably rude. They openly mock customers in their language and act like every ingredient is coming out of their own paycheck. The service is unprofessional, dismissive, and downright insulting. If you value decent customer service and basic respect, avoid this location at all costs. Chipotle as a brand is great, but this location is an embarrassment. Management should seriously reevaluate who they have working here. Oh my god this place gave me the biggest, heaviest, most delicious, dripping chipotle bowl I\u2019ve ever had. Whoever that lady was in the back making the mobile order, bless her soul. I must return back as soon as I possibly can because wow was that bowl worth my $10. That could\u2019ve lasted me a week, but it was so delectable it was gone by the end of the hour. That lady did me so well. I was so full afterwards I couldn\u2019t walk for a good few hours. But this place will give u a bang for your buck. Go to this chipotle! Disappointed!\n\nChipotle is one of my \u201cgo-to\u2019s\u201d but I will no longer frequent this location. Just last night, I did what I usually do: order my regular bowl with all the fixings. The worker on the line followed my lead and placed everything in the bowl as requested. Only problem, he added that I had guac(which I didn\u2019t). The cashier then charged me for it, after I told her I didn\u2019t have it. What does she do? She opens up my food just to see for herself. Gross.\n\nShe then gave me a huge attitude as she had to process a refund. I was then dismissed, as if I caused this issue. No apology for the misunderstanding.\n\nYou clearly don\u2019t care about customer service at this location. Thumbs down all around, and I\u2019ll spend my money elsewhere. I had a fantastic experience with Larry\u2019s BBQ Caf\u00e9 who I used for my office catering order\u2014the service was excellent, and everything arrived on time. The food was delicious, with perfectly smoked meats and flavorful sides that everyone enjoyed. Larry\u2019s delivered on both quality and professionalism. Highly recommend! OUTSTANDING FOOD. I knew it was gonna be good when the person taking our orders (I presume Larry?) told one of my friends to read the menu when he asked what sides they have. He directed us to wait across the street in a hotel lobby because he didn't want us to wait in the cold. The food kicks ass- the BBQ sauce is bold and has a tiny but of heat, the sweet potato fries are rich and slightly buttery, the meat is tender and smoky, the potato salad is killer. We might just come back more than once this weekend! Much love to Larry from Julian, Thomas, Carpathia, and Jordan! We used Larry J's for office catering & we couldn't have been happier. Food was great, customer service went above and beyond, and the price was great (especially for the very generous portion size). Catering was on time, hot, and Larry even set it up instead of just dropping it off. We had a few folks that needed gluten free and he was very accommodating to make sure dishes that we needed gluten free, were. Would recommend this to anyone looking for great BBQ catering with options for everyone! I got wings with fries & candied yams and it was ok for a lunch meal. Improvements needed on the grumpy , dry, rough customer service that I received from staff at the order window.  I had more who asked me for a location to eat at but I could not recommend the place because the friendly service was not present.  Let someone else work if you can't be kind to customers please and thank you. IN A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN MAKING!\nYo, seriously if you're looking for bbq grub, you found the spot.  Sure, it might be a hike to get to in the seaport of Boston, but once you get there, you'll be happy you made the trip. Succulent meats and ribs that fall off the bone into your salivating mouth. This restaurant is a hybrid combination of Texas style BBQ with secret sauces I can't wait to get more of! Thank you Larry and Linda! Ww went for an anniversary dinner , pleasantly greeting after we arrived and was taken to our seats.  We got seatings off the main dining area, which seems like a nice room that could host privately held functions. I liked the ambiance .\nSomewhat rustic but modern twist.\nOur overall service was nice , and  food was pretty much on par to other good caliber restaurants in the area. They forgot to give us bread,  so we had to ask( good bread) , had a slight mistake with our mocktail order , but apologies were given and quickly corrected.\nThe Chilean sea bass tasted slightly different than I'm accustomed to..was just ok for me. I didn't get that flavor, but it wasn't terrible.\nI loved that personal touch of the server making the banana foster right at our table.  Set up the cooking station there and all. So your dessert is freshly made in front of you.\nOverall a beautiful experience.  I recommend , and would go back.\nOops I mistakenly deleted my food photos We had made reservations here. It was wonderful. We had a private area by the windows looking at all. The people from Boston passed by. It was just amazing. Our server was this guy very polite outgoing took care of my son for his graduation that we celebrate.  we\u2019re from Houston Texas. We came a long way to come get that type of treatment Because we went other places and let me tell you they treated us like dirt Boston  people are so rude, but this place made us feel like home. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience the food  was great  we give y\u2019all 10 stars.  From :  Garcia Family .. I have a picture of our waiter very nice person. Thank you again.. The food was delicious everything and I will be back again in that private little area room. We loved it \ud83d\ude0d Flew in from TX to Boston and the first thing I wanted was a good quality, fat cowboy-steak, in a chill low-key vibe. My 22 oz ribeye was perfectly cooked and tender. I also got a little crab cake and Parmesan truffle fries on the side to satisfy my steak frites craving. That little tomato garnish\u2026be careful cutting it because it might slide off the plate \ud83d\ude05. My server Vanessa, was very attentive and nice. She made me feel less clumsy and said the tomato and the bread get a lot of people. It was my birthday dinner!  My waiter Jayo was good, funny, personable and makes me want to come back again! Helped me put together a bomb menu for my birthday meal! Truly enjoyed myself. We stumbled across this gem on our recent Boston trip. This place blew us away. The ambiance was great. The host was warm and welcoming. We sat down at a great corner table and the servers was there within minutes. The drinks came quickly and the menu was epic. So many amazing options. I got the medallion and my fiancee got the wagyu steak all dry aged to perfection. I can't say one bad thing about this place. This is a must stop. Celebrating our 1 year anniversary at the Seaport Hotel & had dinner at Tamo, it was delicious! And very reasonably priced. Highly recommend!! Why venture out into the cold from the Seaport Hotel when Tamo is right here! Good good. Excellent service. The staff is very nice. Try the fish from the docks. Salmon Cakes were delicious. The avocado fries excellent. Truffle fries excellent. I really wanted a sweet treat but all the ice cream shops and bakeries were closed because it was kind of late but then I remembered that you can just go to a restaurant and order dessert so that\u2019s exactly what I did. The tiramisu was delicious and came out very quick. Great service from the staff!!! I\u2019ll have to come back for dinner sometime Even though it took awhile for the food to arrive (even a small bowl of rice), I was quite happy with my orders! It's also been awhile since I enjoyed eating out. First off, the creamsicle drink was so good, love that it tasted just like the ice cream. Good enough that I wanted to chug it, but the alcohol was just enough to slow me down. The Thai mussels are by far my favorite, the curry's addictingly sweet, with a kick of heat which I LOVE. So much so, I paused my frenzy to ask for rice to savor the curry...which took quite the while. My main dish was the salmon, which I enjoyed, but only because I haven't had fish for a while. I enjoyed the pecan nuts and veggies underneath, which my diet has been lacking lately. For dessert was the smores, which my first mistake was biting into the honey and it got stuck in my teeth lol. Fun Fact: they have a bee farm inside and some of their ingredients are made there, which I thought was cool. Definitely coming back for the creamsicle and looking forward to trying other dishes. Also, the bill was by default tipped 18% (I prefer 20%, but didn't have cash with me). This place is absolutely ridiculous! We came in for a nice meal with friends and had the worst service and experience EVER!  We were judged from the moment we walked in and treated very poorly. The waitress messed up our orders several times, the appetizes were brought out after we were finished with our meals. What an awesome meal!  Came here with my family for the first time. Ordered several appetizers and one was better than the next!  We had so much we didn\u2019t have room for dinner but we ordered and ate everything anyway.\nHighly recommend the potstickers, Brussels sprouts and tuna stack for appetizers. Ribs, shrimp tacos and steak were all cooked to perfection and extremely flavorful. Didn\u2019t have time for dessert. Hopefully next time. Our waiter was awesome and everyone was very friendly. Fantastic food! Each dish was beautifully presented and the flavors were great.  The steak bites were perfect.  My only note is that they HAVE to replace the martini glasses at the bar.  They're so thick that you'd expect a molten brownie sundae to be served in them (not a chilled martini).  Nobody feels attractive sipping a $16 martini out of something that feels like a beer stein.  Otherwise kudos to the team and chef! Service was so great, so kind, and patient. They had us waiting longer than expected with a reservation, so they gave us a complimentary appetizer, that was so kind of them. Service was nice enough to check items from the menu for our dietary concerns . They had good accommodations and menu items for young kids as well. The food and dessert were delicious. We have been here a couple of times now and we have sat inside and carried out. The atmosphere is fun and cozy. Carry out food was cold last time but definitely would dine in again. Had the best time there last night! The food was incredible (not just because we were so hungry) but honestly the service made the experience even more enjoyable. Our waitress was Jaelyn and she was such a joy. Attentive, kind, and super personable. Will definitely be back! Speedy service and tasty food. Steak bites are well seasoned and a good sharing option. The mahi mahi sandwich was rich in flavor but a little salty. The side salad it comes with is an excellent pairing. Great location and fun vibes. Express is right! Fast and quality service here. Love that you can build your own bowl or burrito but also offer great combo ideas. Also, love that brown rice is always an option. Great for pick up or dine in over your lunch break. What I ordered:\nLobster Rangoon\nSmall Plate- Walnut Shrimp & Fried Rice\nBowl- White Rice, Premium Ahi, Salmon, Corn, Seaweed Salad, Avocado, Mixed Green, Sriracha Mayo and Sweet Soy Sauce, Edamame, Tobiko, Bonito Seaweed Furikake, Crispy Flakes \u2b50\ufe0f\nBurrito- White Rice, Salmon, Tuna, Mixed Green, Avocado, Carrot, Cucumber, Wasabi Mayo, Creamy Sesame Sauce, Edamame, Tobiko, Jalape\u00f1o Peppers, Bonito Seaweed Furikake\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f = highly recommend\n\nThe food is alright but the poke bowl is worth definitely worth it. It's a quick grab and go in you're in a rush or just need something quick. I personally don't like the burrito as much just cause it does fall apart from both ends. The food at this location is not consistent. I went in last week around lunch and ordered their chicken teriyaki with white rice, it  was delicious. I went back a week later, ordered the same thing and it was horrible. Chicken wasn't as fresh and rice was over boiled. It was like eating mushy rice. I had to throw it away. I wanted to like this place but their food as I stated before is not consistent. This ruined my entire lunch. I had to run back out and get another lunch. The food here is fresh and delicious. However, there is one issue that I\u2019ve encountered repeatedly with one of the workers. Every time I order, he seems to freestyle my order. For example, I ask for mango sauce, and he adds spicy mayo instead. I request cucumber, and he gives me red radish. He swaps everything I ask for. The food is good, but this kind of service can be quite frustrating. BE CAREFUL WITH PAYMENT! The default tip (no selection) is 15%. If you\u2019re careless like me you will end up paying 15% for a take out order. If the owner really wants the money, just mark up the price. This trick really makes me uncomfortable and I\u2019ll never come back again.\n\nFood is okay-ish. Fried rice is overcooked. Taste is worse than Panda Express. Ordered a chicken dosa and costed $14. Definitely delicious and there was a lot of chicken stuffed in there. Lot of quality food and the people making the food were really nice. The tables were always full though and quite dirty. We had to wait 10-15 mins to find a seat. I was visiting from Texas with my girls and absolutely enjoyed the food at this place.\nWe tried dosa with potato filling, idli with sambhar, masala chai, sweet pan.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious and finger licking. Love the ambiance of the place and the Bollywood songs that they were playing.\nService was quick too. It is a small restaurant with a fast casual vibe with a variety of fillings for dosa. Masala Dosa was not the crispiest or thinnest  as it is supposed to be but it tasted good. The Sambar was ok but the coconut chutney was amazing. Just felt like the chutney portion and sambar portion were too small compared to dosa or a plate of Idly.\nWe went on Friday afternoon for lunch and it was crowded as their is limited seating inside the restaurant.\nOverall, not the best but if you are craving South Indian food then it's good enough to satisfy your taste buds.\nDisclaimer - they don't serve uttapam or medu vada on their menu. We got 2 samosas, chai, and samosa chaat. It was really really good, especially the chai. The seating was very nice both indoors and outdoors. Outside, there are 3 swings and different tables to eat at. The decor inside was very good and the wait time was minimal. The food was delicious!! Perfect for Indian snack and meal too!! Good place to have south Indian food, they serve good crisp dosa however not the best.\n\nOverall vibe is neat and clean, food they serve taste good. They do not have a rest room, this is definitely a miss.\n\nMango lassi and coconut chutney are simply yum. Came into Boston just to explore the Silver Line.  In some places the service is FREE - - but - - on Line 3 to Chelsea, pay on boarding.\nThe sections that go underground are by ELECTRIC and the bus stops at Silver Line Way to raise the rails and switch to electric.\n\nAll-in-all a very good day! People working in Silver Line are amazingly wonderful, they helped us find our lost stuff! Many thanks to them! I have used the silver line twice recently from the airport  and i am very pleased i am able  to get home under 10 dollars after being dropped off at Southstation ,,\nBut my issue is the busses dont stay long enough waiting for travellers to board the Logan Airport  terminals they  practically  roll through the terminals and continue moving when potential riders are flowing out the doors\nFYI \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f Why even have arrival boards if you don't use them Silver Line Bus 1 is often running late Clean place...bustling with tourists..sizzling tasty foods colorful flavors from all around the world...dog and human friendly...safe...open space...connected to the city of boston... Beautiful area and venue. Everything was great! Perfect place to go for a vacation or outing with friends and/or family. The harbor and view is gorgeous, and there are lots of places to stop. Wonderful place !!! Beautiful Sunny day to stroll thru area and sightsee Repent the kingdom of God is here. No more warning. Okay people when the World Trade Center is all done with their repairs I will be the first to be down there."

    "reviews": "Innovative salad place with good new cold and hot salad blends mixing sweet and savory with different textures.  The food and flavors were good,  but had room to improve. The manager declined to serve us water because he had no cups. I would expect a $10 salad place to have better customer service especially with so many comparable priced options in the city. I like that all their food is organic and from local farms.  Their menu however is limited and on my one visit I found my salad bowl good but not beyond average. Despite having a HUGE crowd of people flooding in at lunch time, the staff remained very friendly. The line moved quickly, food was OUTSTANDING. It\u2019s a great little gem near the Boston Convention Center if you\u2019re looking to grab something filling, affordable, and healthy during a conference. I will remember this place for future reference! Highly recommended. Yum. Eat vegan. Amazing salads, hearty, filling, and inspirational. Wishing I had this place back home. I did not realize that online ordering was the only option, even if you're at the restaurant. After trying to juggle logins, passwords, etc. without success the manager kindly offered to make our two salads and provided them free of charge to compensate for our difficulty ordering - excellent customer service. She also noted that she would suggest to management that online ordering offer a \"checkout as a guest\" option rather than customers being required to set up an account. I'll definitely be patronizing this location for their excellent salads when I return to Boston. It was $37 for 3 hours. Take that as you will. There was plenty of parking spots and my car felt safe there. My kids enjoyed Little Words Project so much, simple and great activity for a keepsake. It's grown a ton with great views and walking areas! For parking purposes because we went to the Alamo Draft House to see the movie, Wicked. First time eating at Tuscan Kitchen.  Service was excellent, decor is lovely and fitting...I chose a panini that was only mediocre although it was recommended by waiter. I would try the restaurant again and go with my initial choice, fig pizza, which sounded flavorful and interesting. If you want a great lobster roll in a prime location by the water, Barking Crab is the place! I love the clam chowder, the lobster rolls and of course the beers.\n\nWe came on a cold, rainy day in April and it got us excited for summer. Since it was cold, I had the warm roll, but in the summer I like a cold one. It was still busy there even though it wasn\u2019t nice out, service was great and quick! We tried this place while in the area visiting friends. We were greeted at the door of the tent. We asked to seat near the water and after a small wait we were seated at a wonderful table by the water. Our server came by and got our drink orders. We ordered some Crab Cakes and Oysters to start and Lobster Rolls for the meal. The Crab Cakes were very delicious and well made. The Oysters were okay, had better. The lobster rolls were very good. The server was very attentive even though the place was packed. The restrooms are very small and cramped but functional. We found the vibe here to be very fun and upbeat and will return again when in the area. We have to say the fact you are outside in tent is very interesting but great that you get to be by the water. A local recommended the Barking Crab and I'm happy I went! There was a bit of a wait since it was Saturday night, but a spot at the bar opened up for me.\n\nLoved the vibe of the place.. it's a little divey, but the food is really, really good! I had the New England Clam Chowder and the Traditional Lobster Roll. The chowder was hot and so amazing. Whoever decided that bacon in clam chowder was a thing is my hero. The Lobster Roll was stuffed with very sweet lobster meat and the sweet potato fries and coleslaw were great.\n\nHighly recommend that peeps check this restaurant out! The Barking Crab stands out as a premier destination for seafood enthusiasts, offering an unforgettable dining experience right by the water. This charming eatery not only boasts spectacular views but also serves up some of the freshest and most delicious seafood you can find.\n\nFrom the moment you step in, the vibrant atmosphere and friendly service set the tone for a fantastic meal. The staff here are attentive and knowledgeable, eagerly suggesting the best dishes and ensuring that every guest feels welcome and well cared for.\n\nThe menu at The Barking Crab is a treasure trove for seafood lovers. The oysters come chilled and are shucked to perfection, offering a taste of the ocean with each bite. For those who crave something a bit heartier, the lobster is a must-try. Cooked to tender perfection, it captures the essence of New England seafood cooking. However, the real stars of the menu might just be the crab rolls\u2014stuffed full of fresh, succulent crab meat, these rolls are a delightful treat that diners rave about.\n\nPairing these dishes with a side of crispy fries and a fresh salad makes for a meal that is not only satisfying but also balanced. The Barking Crab also features a selection of beers and wines that complement the seafood beautifully, enhancing the flavors with each sip.\n\nEvery aspect of The Barking Crab\u2014from the quality of the ingredients to the exceptional service and the cozy, nautical-themed decor\u2014contributes to a dining experience that goes beyond just eating out. It\u2019s about enjoying good food with good people in a wonderful setting. Really fresh, affordable seafood. The lobster was the highlight but the other dishes we had were very good too. Good prices, it\u2019s a unique set up with tables all over which can make the service and the atmosphere chaotic. But it\u2019s a fun place with lots of energy. Our first visit to the cafe and the place was bustling with customers. Nestled in the historic district, it has that authentic local Boston vibe. The food was top-notch, with great vegetarian and gluten-free options. Big place, lot of gluten free, vegan and dairy free option. Got spicy soup, turkey sandwich, chicken salad sandwich, salmon avocado toast, warm cider. Best scone I've ever had. Chocolate ginger? Never heard of such a flavor combo. Brilliant. Kept this throughout the whole day and it stayed soft from when I bought it at 12:30 to when I finished it at 6:45. Dang that thing was good. All you knead is love! I totally felt the love and passion put into Flour Bakery + Cafe, from the interior design, the overall atmosphere, and staff members. The staff were so knowledgeable off their products and were able to give me recommendations on what to try too! (Hint: you can\u2019t go wrong on what you pick).\n\nI was only in Boston for three days, and yes, I stopped in every day of my visit. I love a good bakery and Flour Bakery is hands down one of the BEST bakery\u2019s I\u2019ve been too. I tried several things (see pictures). Everything tasted spectacular. Thank you Flour Bakery for all the deliciousness and such a wonderful experience during my visit in Boston. The cinnamon roll with a fresh strawberry on top is soooo good. The highlight of my Boston trip so far. The icing is perfect. The blue flower earl grey tea is excellent. Recently my iced coffee from here tastes sour and bitter.. at the same time. Used to be so good but I think the employees have gotten very lazy and are not mixing the coffee correctly anymore I have repeatedly tried this location and have encountered significant problems every single time. Whether it be orders completely wrong, 30+ minute waits on an online order placed 20 minutes prior, or the store accepting an order and then closing earlier than posted and still charging me.\n\nAnytime they have actually fulfilled an order, though every time it has been late or missing, the quality of the product received is always far lower than any other Dunkin location within a mile radius. They need to hire a better type of workers. Some who want to work and provide good service, not like the ones they have. I arrived, they saw me arrive and the boy looked like there was no one in the store and when I asked him if he was working he told me to wait for me and he would go first. To drink his coffee for later He then treated me as I wanted to tax his way of working, which I think is terrible, and he told me to get out, that he wasn't going to sell me anything, that there was no more coffee for me, and that he wouldn't sell me anything. The truth is that We weigh staff to serve \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1eIt's a shame that I have to give 1 star because the truth is, with that type of staff, this dunky deserves 0 stars for the terrible service they provide. The Employees here will not speak a word to you when you greet them. I am NOT looking for a full out conversation with you while getting my morning coffee, but I mean, just blink or something to acknowledge a \"hello, or good morning\"....  It's just so wildly rude and dismissive. Oddly enough the 3 stars is because they make a consistently good iced coffee. I always get 4 at a time, so that I don't have to go in here alot. Terrible service. Guy seemed irritated that I was there and barely spoke to me while talking my order. Not looking for a conversation but some semblance of acknowledging my presence would have been nice. Made one of my drinks and then immediately went and sat down and played on his phone right in front of us. Then, after a few minutes, got up and made the second drink. Again, never said a word. To top it off, the place is gross and dirty. Would not recommend. Great service. Staff really attentive and helpful.\n\nFood was good BBQ but definitely a bit too spicy for my tastes. Burnt ends and pit beans a little too much for me, although the cooling coleslaw goes well with them. The pulled chicken was great, and I loved all of the sauces that were given to us. The gold medal one was delicious.\n\nWanted to call out the star of the show for me, which was the epic brussells. Sprouts are on a lot of menus in Boston but these have by far been my favourite. The baby back ribs here on weekly special were amazing and just fell off the bone - so tender and with an amazing barbecue taste. I loved it. The chicken sandwich was also really good as well. Fries were nice as was the side of Mac and cheese. Outrageously good selections of whiskeys, bourbons, etc. Highly recommend this BBQ joint. Our server was really friendly as well. Made a reservation to have a wonderful dinner date with my better half, we were looking forward to this bbq experience as we are visiting from NY, the beef rib called my attention as not every bbq place offers them and its one of my favorites bbq dishes. Brisket was my girl\u2019s choice. We arrived on time and we greeted and seated. She ordered sangria (long glass fruitless and boring) I got their house whiskey neat (sweet, bold and delightful). We ordered the food, then the serve brought \u201csauces, for the meats\u201d he said.  This was in my head a red flag but continued to sip on the whiskey. Upon the food\u2019s arrival I admired the presentation. However , the beef looked extremely chard I proceed to taste and it was briny and dry. The brisket (was thick almost like a pork chop thick) I stopped eating and waited for the server. My girl ate her sides (mac and cheese and pit beans). I didnt even get a chance to bite the corn bread and the brussels sprouts were my side they were good but I was discouraged to eat by the \u201cbig beef rib\u201d. When the server came by to ask, I said the rib is dry extremely dry. He seems in shock, his manager passed by the table twice and then stopped to ask if I was the person who received the dry beef. He asked if I wanted anything else and I said the check please. Shortly after another server came with a full bill, 2 minutes later the manager came back with a bill only charging for the drinks. It was a disappointing night. There goes my bbq experience in boston. Hands down, the BEST wings I\u2019ve ever had at a bbq restaurant! We are from the south, so we were a bit skeptical of BBQ in the northeast, but boy were we wrong. Every one of us thoroughly enjoyed our food and were pleasantly surprised at the quality and flavors. We will definitely be back when we\u2019re in the area! Smoke Shop may be the best BBQ in the Boston area, I have always enjoyed going in to eat as well. The food is good, the sauces  are great. However, when ordering takeout I was less than enthused. Seems like less than you would get in the restaurant and bad presentation. Hard to imagine the picture of my food cost over $30! It was a bit underwhelming for me. On the surface, the place has a chic, industrial vibe, but the bar area where I was seated felt less than clean\u2014which definitely affected the experience. Maybe it would\u2019ve been different if I had sat at a table.\n\nThe dishes felt a bit overpriced. I did enjoy my squid ink pasta, but my husband found his curry cod dish too overpowering. Overall, it was decent. One of the best Clam Chowders I\u2019ve ever had!\n\nThis place is great for a nice dinner in the city. Really enjoyed everything, and our waiter Jhon was amazing.\n\nBoth the warm butter and the cold lobster roll are delicious. The Oysters are nice and fresh!\n\nFor the fries, I recommend asking for the string fries, the thick ones were a little too thick, but other than that, everything was great. It\u2019s not cheap, but everything was delicious. From oysters to lobster rolls to beats salad, they have it all. The lobster rolls were nicely buttered and they didn\u2019t skimp on the protein which I appreciated. The chips were homemade and perfectly crisp and thin.\n\nThe fried oysters were so savory and left me wanting more. I think that this spot is good for a nice event like an anniversary. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!\nFrom the moment I called to inquire on how busy they were Ben was very welcoming.\nThe quality of the food was top notch. Oysters and clams were delish.\nI was primarily served by Kayla and Brooke and they were Amazing! Also so grateful they kept an eye out for my food allergens and sensitives and I was able to enjoy an delish meal. Thank you to chef Al who caught a sneaky ingredient in one of my orders.\nI\u2019d say this place will be a must again when I come back to Boston. Row 34 in Boston has quickly risen to the top of my list for must-visit dining spots, especially when it comes to seafood. Located in the vibrant Seaport District, this place has nailed the perfect combination of ambiance, service, and culinary excellence.\n\nRight off the bat, the quality and variety of oysters on offer are nothing short of impressive. Each type is fresh, expertly shucked, and served with a minimalist touch that enhances their natural flavors. Moving on to the main courses, the Lobster Roll at Row 34 has set a new standard for me. It\u2019s packed with fresh, succulent lobster meat, lightly dressed, letting the quality of the seafood shine through. Additionally, the Tuna Tartare was another highlight, with its fresh, zesty flavors perfectly balancing the richness of the tuna.\n\nThe service here matches the high quality of the food\u2014attentive, swift, and always with a smile. It\u2019s clear that the staff are as passionate about seafood as the chefs who prepare it. Price-wise, Row 34 offers great value considering the high quality of the dishes served. Everything from the plating to the portion sizes shows a keen attention to detail and a commitment to providing a top-tier dining experience.\n\nBased on a recommendation from a friend who used to live in Boston, my expectations were high, but Row 34 has exceeded them in every way. It\u2019s not just the best place I\u2019ve dined at in Boston; it\u2019s possibly among the best Italian experiences I\u2019ve had worldwide. If you\u2019re in the area, I highly recommend making a reservation, as this popular spot can get quite busy. Whether you\u2019re a local or just passing through, Row 34 is an unforgettable culinary journey that\u2019s well worth the visit. Enjoyed our second visit to Pastoral and it was as expected - Excellent!!    The food, vibe, service, location and ambiance makes this one of my favorite casual restaurants in Boston.\n\nSebastian was our attentive server and was excellent. We had a couple pizzas, pasta and I even tried the grilled squid. Yes - I'll get it again, if you're wondering!!\n\nBe sure to make a reservation for Saturday night. We arrived at 5:10pm and the restaurant was 1/2 full. By 6pm it was packed with enthusiastic customers enjoying their dinner and wine. The presence of the (very pretty!) wood oven created high expectations and the vibe entering the restaurant was very positive. Good lighting, lots of Italian cultural references. We (a bunch of Italians) were ready! Unfortunately, the food we ordered didn't live up to the excitement:\n1) First appetizer (pics in order) had a papery, dry and bland flavor, yet it was greasy.\n2) The meatballs tasted like a commercial / supermarket, not artisanal, product (I want to stress this is purely a flavor-based observation, i'm not implying anything on the actual source)\n3) The margherita pizza presented itself very well, though it was very salty (it sholdn't be) and - more importantly, burnt - one member in our party had a pizza that was completely black (picture 4 shows partially the amount of dough involved after scraping off the topping). Finally, while my pizza tasted good at the moment, it turned out difficult to digest.\n4) The spritz was ok, on the blander side but within standard quality for an average Italian restaurant in the US.\nFor the price and expectations, it was an overall disappointing experience for our party. I am inBoston for work & a local friend took me to this AMAZING restaurant!!!!! A must go to if your local & haven\u2019t experienced their food, flavors & service yet & a must go to if you visiting beautiful Boston! Chef Todd & team are 5 Star!!! Fantastic Pizza, Even Better Service!\n\nPastoral Pizza has been one of our favorite spots in Boston, and a big reason for that is Ray behind the bar. He\u2019s not just a bartender\u2014he\u2019s a true host, always welcoming, personable, and an expert at crafting great drinks. Whether you're looking for a perfect cocktail pairing or just a friendly conversation, Ray makes every visit feel special.\n\nThe food is also top-notch\u2014the wood-fired pizzas are consistently delicious, with a perfectly blistered crust, and the pastas are just as impressive. The restaurant has a lively, comfortable vibe that makes it easy to spend an evening enjoying great food and drinks.\n\nPastoral is a gem, but Ray is what truly makes it stand out. If you\u2019re stopping by, grab a seat at the bar and let him take care of you. Highly recommend! Just recently visited pastoral & I can confidently say it was a great experience. From the moment I stepped in, the ambiance was warm, inviting, and perfectly suited for a relaxing evening out. The food was absolutely divine, with each dish expertly crafted and bursting with flavor\u2014definitely a place for food lovers.\nHowever, what truly made the night exceptional was the service, and specifically the bartender, Ray. Ray went above and beyond to ensure that my experience was top-notch. He was not only knowledgeable about the extensive drink menu but also made fantastic recommendations tailored to my preferences. His charisma and hilarious personality were unmatched, and he truly made us feel like valued guests. Good hot buttered lobster roll! Lobster was definitely fresh, lots of meat. Simple classic lobster roll for sure. Fries are average.\n\nThe service was OK. You order at the counter and when we went, unfortunately the staff was very short with us and not that friendly. The menu is really big and I had a few questions, but their responses were really short.\n\nSmall inside, heated patio outside with about 10 to 12 tables. It was really cool when we went and we were told to sit outside because the inside dining was full. However, there were lots of little birds able to get into the covered patio and were flying around perching on the lights above the tables. Normally this wouldn\u2019t really bother me, but because it\u2019s completely enclosed once the birds were in, they didn\u2019t really seem to go anywhere and they were routinely pooping on the tables and on guests. We ended up moving tables because we are afraid a bird would poop in our lobster roll, as it just pooped on the table about 1 foot from our food. Best lobster rolls I\u2019ve had so far!\nThe staff is friendly and honest.\n\nWe were about to order one lobster roll per person and a lobster mac & cheese to share, but the server immediately let us know that the rolls were already quite filling. He could\u2019ve easily sold us more without saying a word, and that kind of honesty is exactly what I appreciate!\n\nI\u2019ll definitely recommend this place and come back to try more items on the menu.\n\nThey also have a great outdoor area that\u2019s dog-friendly! Wanted a good lobster roll and apparently, this place has a good reputation for lobster rolls. They have hot and cold lobster rolls but I got the hot buttered lobster roll and it was amazing. It was easily the best lobster roll I've ever had but bear in mind that I haven't had many of them (probably 4 in my lifetime). As we all know, lobster meat is expensive so the roll was somewhere around $38 I believe but it does come with fries so that's nice. The lobster bisque was tasty but it was essentially broth with a few big chunks of lobster in it. The Boston creme pie on the other hand was great; the filling itself wasn't very watery but more like a thick pudding. I also tried the fish and chips and they were pretty good too but I'd rather have the lobster roll over the fish and chips. Overall, average prices, good service, really good lobster rolls.  Also, seating was pretty limited and they had a small amount of free parking on the right side of the building. We know we have found a true lobster roll winner, when we had to order a second roll right after our first bite. Located in Seaport, Yankee Lobster is a seafood joint known for their lobster rolls and clam chowders.\n\nThis was the most generously portioned lobster roll I\u2019ve ever had. The lobster meat was piled high in LARGE chunks instead of tiny shredded pieces!!\n\n\uff0aTraditional Lobster Roll\nThe lobster was so tender and succulent, while the bun was slightly toasted, soft and buttery. It was lightly tossed in herb mayo, which added a burst of aroma without overpowering the natural sweetness of the lobster.\n\nWe got it for takeout so we opted for the traditional lobster roll, which was served cold. \u00a0I\u2019ll definitely try the hot butter one next time. If you have a small appetite, it is nearly impossible to finish the roll in one sitting.\n\nThe lobster rolls are all marked as \u201cmarket price\u201d. We paid $39.63 (after tax) for one lobster roll. At first we were hesitant because of the steep price, but it was worth the splurge surprisingly. I kind of wish they were more transparent with the prices though. Food was AMAZING. Delicious lobster roll with a  large portion that was well priced compared to other Boston restaurants. Helpful and friendly staff.\n\nEven though we went on a Tuesday for a late lunch, the place quickly filled up (quite a small venue, but has a neat diner style vibe). Clearly a popular spot for locals, and I can see why! The venue is located in a picturesque area. It was beautifully decorated for the winter season. We visited it when it was snowing as a bonus to the decorations. Little cosy restaurant with delicious food. Great for both business lunch or romantic dinner. Highly recommended! This place is pretty small and it seems like reservations are the way to go. I was just one person so I was able to sit at the bar without it. Since it was Saturday they were serving brunch and there were a lot of good options. I went with the lobster avocado toast. They don't have any mocktails on their menu but since I'm pregnant the bartender graciously made me something delicious and pear-flavored that I really enjoyed. The food was great and the portion was large! We were able sit at the bar without a res but as others have mentioned, it is a very small place. Food was good, bartender was making up some drink specials that looked amazing but didn\u2019t try. Food came out with a hair on it but the staff took care of it, no worries, it happens. Beautiful spot! Beautiful restaurant with a stunning view of the ocean. The service was great with very kind and friendly staff. The food presentation was colorful and cohesive. The food itself was delicious for the most part, but my friend and I agreed that it lacked some flavor and seasoning. With some more flavor and seasoning throughout, it would have been perfect. We were also surprised to learn that there were no oysters, which was a very sad realization for us as we were really hoping for some oysters. Overall lovely place and hope to try more of their dishes in the future. The shrimp cocktail at 75 on Liberty wharf was absolutely amazing! So freaking fresh. We loved our table it was right on the water. The server was fantastic and very on point. The lobster roll was delicious with great flavors. The way they did the lobster and the filling was very well balanced. We loved the Skillet cookie dessert as well, a great way to top off the meal. An enjoyable experience at Del Frisco during Boston Restaurant Week. We had plenty of food. I particularly enjoyed the complimentary bread for its balance of sweet and buttery. The lobster bisque is slightly salty though still flavorful. The steak was definitely the highlight, perfectly cooked to taste, paired with the delicious garlic butter. I do wish they included the steak with some sides. The salmon was unfortunately underwhelming, if not slightly dry. As for desserts, the butter cake was too sweet, and the cake itself was so hard that it required force to crack. The chocolate mousse was quite good, as it's hard to go wrong there.\n\nOverall, there was some hit or miss there with some of the food items, but I did enjoy my evening there - perhaps w good company. I was there for a birthday party last night and it was absolutely amazing the staff was on point 100% very professional very courteous very tentative to all our needs true blessing Jacob  is fantastic at his job phenomenal couldn't ask for a better evening and the birthday girl was exquisitely pleased!! I would like to add the bathroom was extremely clean the every part of the ambiance truly amazing including staff!! There are people that are there that appreciate good service food and personality thank you very much Came to this gem to celebrate my birthday with my man and it was really nice. Beautiful venue inside and out. Comfortable seating which includes small 2 people tables, booths, or a large table for a group setting. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Chris was our server and he made us feel super welcomed and was beyond helpful. I was so stuffed I couldn\u2019t order dessert but Chris knew what we were celebrating and he brought out a strawberry cheesecake for me at no charge :) I loved my experience there and would definitely recommend this restaurant. My man went to the bathroom and left his napkin on the table and a server came around and folded it and put it back in its proper place which I absolutely lovedddd!!!! 10/10 !!!!!! Del Frisco's Seaport is part of the chain of Del Frisco's Steakhouses, this one being right on the water with views out towards Boston's harbor.\n\nWe came here for my grandmother's 80th birthday, and the service did not disappoint. There is a dress code, but that's to be expected with the quality of the meal and the experience. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, especially since my grandmother doesn't speak English.\n\nThe food did not disappoint. The caesar salad was light and refreshing, with it pairing well with the bisque they served as well. Steak was paired with mashed potatoes, and they went well on their own or combined. We ended with different assortments of cakes for my grandmother, and each dessert was unique and flavorful, without being too sweet.\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience to try and go to for special occasions. I\u2019m from TN & so far this has been the BEST of the best food wise. From apps, to drinks, main course, sides and even dessert. We got the calamari, 45 day dry aged ribeye, and lobster Mac n cheese. My husband and I split all that and got the butter cake for dessert.  Emily was a great server to us and really cared about how our experience was. I will say it\u2019s pricey but completely worth every penny. I would definitely recommend this steak house to anyone I know if they\u2019re in the area. Great service! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and we had some great banter over food and preparations. He had nice recommendations when it came time to pick out our menu selections. That would be my advice, the menu is huge... Let them help guide you. We were not disappointed and even tried some new things. The stuffies were awesome and the tuna had the perfect texture. So many flavors it was a fantastic meal with a lot of great energy in the dining room. Not to mention the wonderful views at this Harborside location. The Boston cream pie is not traditional but it's still very good! I was traveling on a business trip from India in January, and as a seafood lover, how could I have missed dining at Legal Sea Foods? The food and atmosphere were amazing. I'd like to give a BIG shout-out to Megan, who was absolutely fabulous in suggesting some of the best dishes on the menu. She was incredibly helpful. Loved the food ! My family came from out of town to celebrate my sister's birthday and we had an amazing experience! We came as a group of eight with a reservation for a Saturday lunch and were seated in the corner with a great view of the water. The atmosphere was lively but not too loud.\n\nOur server Bailey was excellent - she was patient, friendly, and accommodated all of our requests including taking group photos and helping us with the birthday cake.\n\nThere was a promotion going on for $1 cups of clam chowder with an order of an entree, so for appetizers most of us got clam chowder and we also split some oysters and calamari. I ordered the fish sandwich, which I could barely finish because I was so full from the appetizers. I appreciate that all our entrees were brought out at the same time.\n\nWe came to Legal Sea Foods as a family countless times growing up, so I'm really pleased we had another good experience. It's not cheap, but I appreciate that everything tasted fresh and I'm happy to support a local chain. The wife and I tried this restaurant while visiting Boston. We started with the clam chowder. It was perfect on a cold evening. I had the fried shrimp with Cajun seasoning, french fries, and coleslaw. My wife had the grilled salmon, whipped potatoes, and brussel sprouts with bacon. Both were delicious. The waitress was friendly and attentive. We were seated near the window with a view of the harbor. If I ever visit Boston again, it will be mandatory for me to stop by Legal Sea Foods. I booked the trip before looking at the weather forecast so unfortunately the light drizzle and wet cold prevented outdoor patio seating to enjoy the harbor views. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve spent a lot more money at other seafood restaurants in my life but the food here was very approachable and delicious, top-tier. Got the staples like clam chowder, lobster roll with butter, and a half-dozen of assorted oysters. For $45 bucks I got a huge lobster roll with a generous amount of lobster but man! I\u2019m not gonna even lie, I loved the oysters too. I\u2019m a purist, and those oysters sitting in its own oceanic liquor were enough on their own but a tiny sprinkle of mignonette is okay \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc. It\u2019s no wonder they have so many locations and long-time relationships with the local professional sport teams. I recently ordered takeout from this place and was surprised to be asked for a tip, even though it was a to-go order. When I inquired, the staff explained that they recommend tips of 15%, 18%, or 20%, with a minimum of 15%, even for takeout. While I understand tipping for dine-in service, I didn\u2019t expect it to be required for takeout. It\u2019s something to keep in mind if you\u2019re ordering from here. The food was alright, the chicken was well cooked but it looks like they just threw chicken in a box and then tossed hot sauce on top. I expected the chicken to be covered in it, not just sauce in scattered places. The service wasn\u2019t great, they seemed rushed and not very polite and with little to no one in the restaurant the wait was still 15-20 minutes for your food. Not worth the money or wait in my opinion. This is exactly what I was hoping for! It tastes just as good as in Korea. I'm confident. You can count on it. plus, I love the self-service bar! Greasy chicken covered with sugar. Too much spices probably to cover the low quality chicken.  $20 for an 8 piece small slider chicken. And you have yo pay tips because you pay on an ipad even though you clean after yourself and pick up the order from the counter yourself. Not recommended. Also, ridiculously loud obnoxious music. I had to leave and didn't finish the food. Something I rarely do. That's how bad that experience was. Ordered 3 different flavors to share with a friend. It's nice b.c you can order 6 of each flavor.  Delicious food, some of the best wings I've had.  Definitely recommend checking this place out I had a great experience dining on a weekday for early dinner. The food was incredibly authentic, fresh, and prepared quickly. From start to finish, everything was delicious, and the friendly staff only added to the overall experience. One of the highlights was the amazing view of the pier\u2014it made for a perfect backdrop while enjoying my meal.\n\nThe lobster guacamole was good, though I felt it could have used a bit more seasoning to really bring out the flavors. On the plus side, the restaurant has an impressive selection of tequila and mezcal, which added a nice touch to the meal.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a spot I\u2019d recommend for the food, the atmosphere, and the great service. Honestly for the price it wasn\u2019t worth it and maybe it is because I tried just one item of the menu which was the shrimp fajitas and it was not that good. I had it before from their Framingham Branch and it honestly it didn\u2019t compare. I just feel like it was over priced, full of veggies and it came with like 5 shrimps for $30. What i thought were shrimps kept turning out to be plantains. However i will say the calamari starter was very delightful, I enjoyed the sweet teriyaki or barbecue flavor on there with the chips that came along. We had an amazing dining experience at this restaurant! The food was delicious, with a great variety of flavorful dishes that truly hit the spot. What made the experience even better was the fantastic view and the stunning ambience. Whether you're there for a casual meal or a special occasion, the setting feels perfect. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for great food with a beautiful sea view.\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND DISH\nLobster Pablano Dip Temazcal Tequila Cantina is a fantastic spot, especially if you are a vegetarian! I went with family and loved the vibe, especially the outdoor seating right by the water. The food was delicious, with plenty of vegetarian options to choose from. I highly recommend the quesadilla and fajitas\u2014they were flavorful and well-prepared. Overall, a wonderful dining experience! The food & service was amazing. My seat was by the window view of the Boston harbor. My server maria did amazing job. Delicious food, I love the ramp and fun indoor and outdoor chairs.\n\nI also appreciate the iPads, which make ordering much easier.\n\nI wish the doors were automatic, as they are quite heavy, but I loved the location otherwise!\n\nThe lemonade flavors are so delicious and refreshing, and because they  are well sealed  (a plastic seal) they make for easier transport by wheelchair. Location is by Boston Tea Party Museum. Saw all the good reviews and my daughter loves Noodles. We walked in and I can smell the MSG in here. Daughter ordered a crafted her own bowl which she liked. I orded a bok chop side which I did not like. Wife ordered edaname. Very average Fastest - freshest- best food!\nPerfect for a quick delicious bite of food while exploring. The overall atmosphere is great if you want away from the crowds. We came when it was empty and it was perfect! 10/10 recommend! I stumbled across Bon Me during a break from a conference in town. Fantastic food and great service. It was surprisingly quiet at 2.30pm during the week for such a highly rated restaurant. \ud83c\udf5c Had takeout for dinner, party of 4. Fast service. Everything was very tasteful, not too spicy at all, even for the meals with 2 ou 3 peppers on the menu. Good portions. Great prices. Will definitely go back for a quick, simple, fast and tasteful meal. I was greeted by a very kind lady who asked me of my order as soon as I stepped in the door. I was amazed by their immediate response. I ordered a Hot Coffee 20 oz with a hazelnut flavor. I also ordered the Sunrise Breakfast Burrito (Fresh 12\u201d tortilla with bacon, ham, sausage and eggs, feta onions, tomatoes, spinach and Mozzarella. THE WORKS.) both food and drink are phenomenal and I recommend you come and try it for your self. Trio HANDLES BUSINESS. Came here to pick up a lunch. The chicken club was one of the best sub sandwiches I've had anywhere, I was thoroughly impressed.  The employee who helped me was very friendly as well. It is in an unusual area with very little space for dining in but is perfect for picking up a meal to-go. The breakfast sandwich was good. However, I'm from out of town and thought a cafe on the pier sounded like a great breakfast option. I envisioned something very different. It's a good hole-in-the-wall if you work on the very industrious pier. Their catering looks great, but it is not a cute place to sit and have breakfast on the water. The food was delicitios and I enjoyed the ease of the delivery and no warry service . Freshly made and very good breakfast croissants or bagels, among best anywhere, and actually good and large coffee, plus a number lunch sandwiches and salads.geared to fishermen and catering events nearby, so dining is a tiny bar- and pleasant conversation with the lone staff. Hidden gem up the center of the pier. Atmosphere was very very good to discuss business. Could be great for a romantic evening. Each menu item looked delicious. I really enjoyed the French Onion Soup that I started with - and the Campfire Torte! (Fanciest \"S'more\" I've ever had). Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience! Really cool open concept, food is really excellent. Service was a bit slow, but they got everything right so that counts for something.\nWindows open up along the boardwalk in nice weather so it's as if the whole place is outdoors. Patio area, rooftop up above way up which doesn't serve food but you could eat downstairs and then go up to the roof. Usually a wait to get in.\nI'd definitely go back to eat here! Our waitress, Mariam, was hands down fantastic! We came for brunch and she was friendly, helpful and professional. My boyfriend\u2019s Steak with Eggs came well/medium (supposed to be medium-rare). We were talking as he cut it so Mariam actually saw it before we noticed! She obviously suggested to have it fixed/replaced. Such a chilled vibe in a swanky dining area. We would absolutely be back! Executive chef Tatiana Rosana is a freaking rock star.  (As seen on the Food Network's Chopped) There were times I actually closed my eyes to focus and savor.  Do not miss the peas and carrots.  The complexity will shock you.  And do not skip dessert.  Make it a cheat day if you must, but try the campfire marshmallow ganache.  I forget the name, but will never forget the flavors. Good food and cool atmosphere, but really pricey and club-like, and the portions are teeny. We got a bunch of small plates to share, and the guacamole with tostones and steak tartare were great, but the flatbread with salami and calamari were only okay. However, the cider sangria was very good, as was the aperol spritz! We got a grand macaron for dessert, which was actually massive!\n\nThe waiter came by to check on us often, which was nice, and the lights and decor are cool. However, they make you feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome when you first enter, and have a literal bouncer to check your bag before heading to the rooftop bar (great views, but otherwise not amazing). Great food, great ambience and great service. T\nDidn't know this place was such a vibe from inside and served so many veg items.  We had their avocado rice rolls, crispy cauliflower which was delicious,  mapo tofu which was great as well, scallian pancakes, and noodles. I would definitely recommend this place. The portion size is good and the service is also great. Great restaurant atmosphere. The host and waiter were exceptional. Loved that they had a dress code, but it wasn\u2019t enforced- several people were wearing baseball hats and hoodies. Bartender was not super bubbly but made a good drink. Food presentation was superb, but the food itself was not incredibly flavorful (we aren\u2019t crazy spice people, but the spicy avocado salad had almost no detectable heat, to the point where we were spooning extra chili sauce into it and the wontons for flavor). Teriyaki steak noodles were the best of the dishes we tried. Overall good experience. The food was good but the flavours could have been more punchy. The price was high for what the food is. Our waitress was so kind, we really liked her. Go for the  atmosphere. First time coming here and I have to say the service and food was top tier. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure my BF bday was extra special.  We will be back and and we're bring friends!!! But get there early to find parking. Loved it.. food  is great. Avocado rice bite is my favorite.. Portions are large more of shareable size. Parking garages are near by or street paid parking. Had a wood-fired, thin crust, good taste pizza(better than average). Lots of seating space. Went there on Tuesday night, had 0 wait time. Didn't like the bread with extra virgin olive oil that they served. The food is incredible! So fresh and full of delicious flavor. We tried and shared many things on the menu. The service was friendly, patient with our questions and quick. I recommend reservations. By 6pm on Saturday it was packed. Forget to take pics of foods, only have desserts. Overall experience is overpriced, not very worth it. The gnocchi is okay but very little-look like the size of the dessert and only one level (just covered the middle of the plate). The chicken is good but they put too too much salt. The pasta is hard and salty. Desserts are good but overall lunch costed us (2.5 person) $90 with one person still hungry.(neither of us are over 160 pounds)\nThe reason I give 2 stars is because i would like to deduct 1star for foods, one star for pricey and one star for services. The services here is friendly (with smile) but super slow without many guests (actually very few people and many waiters, when we were there). We spent tons of time waiting for waiter to serve menu, waiting for him to come back and order, and waiting for checks. The \"how is everything goes\" doesn't help change my view of the service at all.\nThis comment might be personal but Will NEVER try again. On Fridays they have a three course menu for $19 and it is completely worth it. Their spicy fried mozzarella balls is a great appetizer. Highly recommend their pepperoni pizza. For dessert- go for the tiramisu or the chocolate gelato. The bar staff were ok a little cold. The food was amazing, dessert selection could use some Italian choices. Ideal Seafood and Sal you are the best in the business of seafood \u203c\ufe0f I miss you and your delicious whole fresh fish products. I moved to the South in March and I'm looking forward to seeing you before my visit to Boston ends so I can take some quality seafoods back with me frozen solid. Blessings to you all. Great fresh product...fair prices Super convenient location as it's open 24/7. I had the tuna salad sandwich. It was one of the best tuna sandwich I ever had. The French bread was soft. The tuna salad had a delicate balance of green onion and salt. I added cheddar cheese and avocado. The sandwich not big like a subway sandwich was 10.00 pricey but worth it. The sandwich without the add ons is 7.99.\n\nPs. Of course this location has alot of panhandling proceed with caution. So I don\u2019t usually have this problem at Au bon pain but tonight I  had an extremely horrible experience. Apparently during shift change, they close the store and no one wanted to come to the window to explain that to many us waiting outside. Finally the big guy came to the window yelling what didn\u2019t we understand that they were changing shifts. I told him I\u2019ve never experienced this and he just shut the window without given any info. And he said that he was busy doing other things and didn\u2019t have time to come to the window to explain. Very very RUDE. I was choked and I have a picture of him not caring for their customers. Nice bakery with great extended hours for patients family and health workers. Clean healthy food choices. I absolutely love Steven's attitude\u2014he's such a great manager! Every time I see him, he puts a smile on my face with his kindness and positivity.Thank you for making my caramel fraps taste amazing you\u2019re the best! The manager is a great guy. The rest of the staff are hardworking and kind. The food and coffee are always delicious. This place is soooo vibey! The food was all around good and super unique. It\u2019s tapas style and Mediterranean. We thought the feta 2.0 was very unique and the zucchini chips really hit the spot. The patatas bravas were a let down and we didn\u2019t even finish them.. they kind of tasted like baked potatoes American style don\u2019t recommend. The lamb meatballs were warm but not hot and pretty good. Everything was pretty expensive but high quality. I wouldn\u2019t say the most outstanding meal but pretty good! the food was incredible!!! so fresh and plated very very well. the zucchini chips were great and the cauliflower was incredible. i also recommend their pita. definitely on the pricey end but worth the money. our waiter Alejandro was great at his job and knew exactly what to recommend. very cool vibe, will for sure be coming back. \ud83d\udccd Location & Atmosphere\nCommittee in Boston offers a beautiful view of Seaport, making it a perfect spot for those seeking a scenic dining experience. The atmosphere is vibrant and stylish, with a modern, chic interior that complements the lively vibe of the area. Sitting by the booth gives you an intimate yet spacious feel, and the overall ambiance is both upscale and relaxed. The view outside adds a stunning touch to the meal, making it an ideal place for both casual dining and special occasions.\n\n\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Food & Drinks\nWe started with the pita, which was absolutely delicious. The presentation of the dish was stunning\u2014each dip was so vibrant and full of color, something I\u2019ve rarely seen before. The flavors were a perfect blend of buffalo, sweet, and savory, offering a unique taste experience. However, I did wish they offered more pita since there was way too much dip for just five pieces of pita, leaving me wanting more of the great flavor.\n\nFor the main course, I tried the lamb burger, curious about how the typically gamey flavor of lamb would come through. To my surprise, the burger was delicious\u2014the lamb was cooked tenderly and well-seasoned, and the arugula and pickled onion added a nice balance of freshness and tang. The fries on the side were the perfect complement, crispy and flavorful, rounding off the meal nicely.\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 Service & Hospitality\nWhile the food was great, the service could use some improvement. It felt like the staff didn\u2019t quite want to be there, and I noticed that it was hard to get their attention. Even though we were sitting in a corner, it seemed like the waitstaff was nowhere to be found at times, which could definitely be worked on for a smoother dining experience.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Unique Selling Point\nCommittee stands out with its beautiful views of Seaport and artfully presented dishes, especially the vibrant dips that offer a flavorful and visually appealing experience. Food is nothing extraordinary for the price but it\u2019s good. Nice ambiance, very loud, keep in mind if you\u2019re looking for something more quiet and intimate. MUST get the fried zucchini. calamari OK. Feta with sesame and honey and shrimp were just OK. Burrata was good, served with pesto. Keftedes also OK, nothing extraordinary. Chicken kebabs were super good! Disappointing but not terrible. I booked a table for two over a month in advance for a Monday night. I arrived and was sat at a communal table, not what we wanted for a date night. When I asked the host about being moved to a table for two, they (younger, wearing a sweatshirt,  straight brown hair about shoulder length on 4/7) was very rude. They rolled their eyes at me and said they were very busy. Which is why I made the reservation. He told me that I was supposed to make a note that we wanted a low top table, but that isn't stated anywhere on the website (picture of their reservation rules included in this review). We were able to get a seat about 20 minutes after our reservation. Service was okay after that but a bit slow, especially when we wanted the check (took about 20 minutes after they cleared all our plates). Food was good except for the sandy muscles which they took off our check. The cocktail we got (an apple jack, pear, mead drink) was pretty bland unfortunately, but the beer and wine were good. I do wish that the menu said the beers were just cans. Overall, not awful but a marked decrease in quality from visits in the past. We came here for a quick food break. The Self ordering system made it quick and easy to order what we wanted. We grabbed a table number once our food was ready. A nice lady brought it to us and was very pleasant. We ate and left. For a quick bite to eat, it's definitely worth checking out. Good food and pleasant staff. 5 stars this place is a must to go with friends or family.  They are so nice Kai , Derek and the whole staff are like the Justice League.  When I have a bad day they save it and I just want to say the chicken the shakes the fries are all excellent too.  It\u2019s well lit, not too loud and very good to chat and eat. Burgers were smaller than I expected, but tasty.\n\nPeople say Shake Shack is basic, but so is everything else at Seaport so just eat whatever you want.\n\nI wanted burgers, I went to ShakeShack. Absolutely disgusting. This Shake Shack at Seaport Boston is a rodent-infested, overpriced excuse for a burger joint. Numerous reports have been made to the board of health about the rampant uncleanliness, yet no corrective action has been taken. Cross-contamination and filth run rampant, putting customers at risk of illness. It\u2019s shocking that this place is still operating under these conditions. If you care about your health, avoid this place at all costs! We were looking for a casual place for lunch that wasn't $50 a person. This was within walking distance, so that's where we went.\n\nWhen you come in, they have a machine to take your order. If you have been there before you know what to get, but never having been there, it was a lot to go through.\n\nMy spouse got the burger and I got a chicken sandwich. I also opted for one of the shakes.\n\nThe food looked wonderful. The fries were cold and had no salt on them. The burger was ordinary, as was the chicken. The chicken was cooked well and was crunchy. Neither had anything to make it a \"must go back\" for me.\n\nThe shake was chocolate salted caramel. What I had this built up to be in my mind wasn't what it was. I didn't  get any caramel, and the chocolate had a bitter taste to it.\n\nThis isn't  my favorite  meal ever, but it would work for a semi-quick meal that doesn't break the bank. Very tasty and fresh, so much good flavor! I added some ingredients to my stir-fry to my liking, portion was hefty when it arrived. Will definitely be ordering from here again, that's for sure! SMACKIN! I ordered the spicy garlic stir fry w broccoli, parsley & they did a great job on it. This place is very tasty and well worth it Love the concept but I was pretty disappointed about the portion size. I felt like my order was 1/2 portion but when I look online for other orders, it looks like a normal portion size for this place. My recommendation for what it is worth: perhaps alter the menu slightly to indicate a small and large size. To me, this would easily be a small if not \"kids' small.\" The \"double\" portion option that they do offer doesn't really help for a first-time customer to understand how they define portion size. I am attaching a picture of the \"create your own bowl\" that I ordered. We are always looking for gluten friendly places. We were immediately.\ngreeted by a friendly employee who helped us complete our order to ensure it was gluten free. With\nthe create your own stir fry, it was well labelled what you could choose. Made a pit-stop here for a late lunch/early dinner while walking around and it exceeded my expectations. The dishes we got were flavorful and had just the right amount of food for the active day. I wish I lived closer to one of these because I would definitely go more often. Came here to celebrate an engagement, Strega was able to handle a large group with no issue. The food and service were both great, and the decor was very classy. They even included a free dessert. Thank you for helping us have a special night out! Excellent Italian food here! Just had a wonderful dinner and I look forward to eating the leftovers. The pizzele appetizer was fantastic\u2014I would 100% get it again as it may have been one of the best prosciutto dishes I\u2019ve eaten. I loved my bolognese\u2014very warm and flavorful on a rainy day. We didn\u2019t love the dessert options so we opted out, but you can\u2019t go wrong with most of the dishes here. High quality pasta and ingredients. Everything was amazing. S/o to our waiter Isaiah! Recommended me to try the Berry Bourban smash and it was delicious!!!\n\nI called in and let them know to have a special table for us to celebrate my friends pregnancy. Isaiah came over to greet us with Mock Champagne toast.  Her Mocktail was also delicious.\n\nFood was outstanding. Misto frito consisted of fried shrimp, calamari, zucchini & Calabrian aioli. They did not skimp out on the portion either. The eggplant app was so incredibly delicious AND crispy!! I got the bolognese with Braised Beef and Pork Ragu \u2014 mouthwatering.  My friend for the octopus pasta which she loved. And dessert was also soooo good.\n\nEverything was amazing from start to finish. THIS is what I look for when I go out to eat. Can\u2019t wait to come back! Very good menu with a variety of options.  Swordfish portion was small for the price. On the other hand, my wife\u2019s portion was just right. Drinks were creative and tasty. Although there is not a kids menu, one can order half a pasta portion with an added choice (meatballs for example). Friendly staff, great bread. I would rate this as 4.5. I just cannot seem to select a .5. And the only reason it is not a 5 was due to the small swordfish portion. They were out of Salomon. I went on a Sunday at 5 pm. with a friend (they open at 4 pm this day). There were a few people in the establishment, but not at full capacity. The atmosphere is elegant and sleek. I sat at the bar, seats were very comfortable, and the bartender was amazing (great conversation with her). I ordered wine, so I'm not sure of the cocktails. They also give you bread and oil (which was very good). I ordered the 'Cacio E Pepe' with goat cheese ( it was so good). For dessert, I had the 'key lime pie', it was very sweet (too sweet for me. It can also be a shareable dessert). I'm definitely going here again. Food and service was ok. The pulled pork pizza was good but the burger was small and plain. Ordered a beer, they were out. Ordered another beer, they were out. There was a live Dj upstairs but they seated everyone downstairs and no one got to enjoy the live music. They also never refilled our water. There are MANY breweries in Boston, but Trillium is its BEST. Gifted in many brewing styles, I was seriously impressed by their IPAs. I highly recommend Olmsted and Melcher Street.\n\nWe also had lunch at Trillium - Fort Point, and it was also excellent. We enjoyed the Caesar salad and the smash burger. Friendly & knowledgeable staff. This location has a vinyl lounge on the second floor along with an outdoor deck in the summer. Trillium is a MUST visit for any & all beer enthusiasts. Trillium Bar stands out as a prime destination for craft beer enthusiasts, offering a remarkable array of over 50 artisanal brews. Located in a vibrant area, this bar provides a perfect backdrop for both casual outings and special gatherings, where patrons can explore a diverse selection of beers without breaking the bank.\n\nThe atmosphere at Trillium is inviting, with a laid-back yet energetic vibe that makes it ideal for unwinding after work or catching up with friends over the weekend. The staff at Trillium are known for their friendly and knowledgeable service, always ready to recommend the perfect beer to match your taste or to introduce you to new flavors you might not have tried otherwise.\n\nWhile the prices are notably affordable, making high-quality craft beer accessible to a wider audience, it\u2019s important to note that the beers themselves tend to be quite robust. Many guests have commented on the richness of the brews, suggesting that they are best enjoyed slowly to fully appreciate their complex flavors and to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n\nDespite this small caveat, Trillium Bar earns a solid 5 out of 5 stars for its excellent service, extensive beer selection, and welcoming atmosphere. It\u2019s a must-visit for anyone looking to delve into the world of craft beer or for those simply seeking a great spot to relax and enjoy some quality beverages. Whether you\u2019re a seasoned beer aficionado or new to the craft beer scene, Trillium Bar is sure to provide a memorable experience. Lives up to the hype as one of the top breweries in the US. Every beer I tried was outstanding and best part was they collaborated on three beers with one of my all time favorites, Garage Project! Good local brewery known for IPAs and Stouts.\n\nCame here for brunch this past Saturday. I\u2019ve visited Trillium\u2019s other locations before, but this was my first time at their Seaport spot. They\u2019ve got an entire three-story brick building to themselves, with the first floor and rooftop dedicated entirely to brewery visitors. Since we couldn\u2019t snag a reservation for Saturday brunch, we arrived just before opening to grab a table on their dog-friendly patio. However, the hostess informed us that the patio wasn\u2019t open for service due to a lack of servers. Still, we were able to order at the bar and bring our drinks to the only non-reserved table on the patio.\n\nAs usual, we kicked things off with some IPAs and the Spicy Chicken Dip\u2014a combo that\u2019s practically a go-to for everyone I know. Next, we tried the Roma Rigatoni, which came highly recommended by one of the kitchen staff. It didn\u2019t disappoint and became our favorite as well. The rigatoni had a nice kick, and the addition of sausage took it to the next level.\n\nOn the other hand, the brunch menu items we tried\u2014Trillium Hash and Crab Benny\u2014were just okay. The Hash was essentially home fries with a few scattered bits of ingredients that barely made an impact, so I\u2019d rather stick to the home fries that come gratis with the entr\u00e9es. The Crab Benny was a bit better, with sourdough replacing the usual English muffins, which paired nicely with the crispy texture of the crab cakes.\n\nTrillium might not be the most exciting brewery on the block anymore, but it\u2019s still a fantastic spot to relax with some great food. I\u2019d definitely consider coming back for their rooftop if I find myself in the area again. My vote is hot lobster rolls! With chips. Come hungry and bring friends who encourage sharing. I recommend the oysters, probably the best I\u2019ve yet to have! Also great spot for brunch, the eggs Benedict was delicious! You can\u2019t go wrong with the truffle fries, home fries, or chips. The earth bowl and Charcuterie Board are also local favorites. I love the atmosphere and the staff at ReelHouse is super friendly. Pay attention to the hours of operation and make a reservation just to be safe. I had a decent lunch here recently. I tried a flatbread, some oysters, and the rainbow selection of tacos. Overall, the food was just okay. The tacos were easily the best, followed by the oysters, and then the flatbread, which I could easily skip in the future.\n\nWhat I took more issue with was the service. Our water glasses were empty most of the meal, our waitress rarely came in to check on us, and I\u2019m disappointed they never asked us the order in which we wanted the food to arrive. The pizza came before the oysters which didn\u2019t make much sense to me.\n\nWhen we finished our meal, it took forever to get the check since our server was talking to someone (maybe he was one of the owners? I\u2019m not sure, but regardless, we couldn\u2019t get her attention at all) for almost 10 minutes. Definitely not in a rush to come back the place is very beautiful, well decorated. There is an outside space with a mezzanine to enjoy the sea in the summer. But, the food is not good. I ordered pasta with shrimp and the sauce was really bad. It looked like it was the simplest canned food. The dish was nothing special. My friend ordered a burger which also wasn't anything special. Suggestion: go for a drink, not dinner. The waiter brought the food before the cutlery, it took a while for him to come and serve our table. I never leave reviews, but I had a horrible experience here. When I tried to sit down at an open chair at the bar to order, I was told not to sit very rudely and the bartender pulled out a reservation sign that was not there before I tried to sit down to prevent me from sitting there. When another person came to sit, I asked her if she reserved the seat (just to make sure) she told me no and was confused. I have never experienced this kind of service before anywhere in my life. My friends and I immediately left. There are plenty of places around that value their customers and I would recommend going somewhere else. I used to be a regular, but I will never be coming back here again. Incredible location. Great bar, excellent service. WAY too hot. WAY. I nearly passed out. Had one cocktail and left. I don\u2019t know who the architect was but big fail. A/C is underpowered. They sit right on Pier 4 Boston\u2019s waterfront overlooking the skyline - they should have had sliding glass panels or something to open up this beautiful place to the waterfront, taking advantage of the cool breezes in the evening. Anyway, 4 Stars. We went to the nightclub. It was super fun. \ud83e\udd29 $30 per person to get in and security made sure to escort any drunk patrons out. The experience made us all feel young and 21 again. First time here and it was very relaxing. I was ordering drinks and food for myself and my friend from 5:30 PM (start of my reservation time). Till 8PM when we finally finished. $20 all you can eat tacos on Tuesdays. Staff was very nice and brought everything we needed and asked for. Had the steak, chicken and fish Tacos and it was good. Good food, drinks and overall atmosphere. The nachos are massive and need a minimum of at least 2 people if you want to get close to finishing it at all. Loved the Mexican Mule. The wings were good but the BBQ sauce needs some work. Overall great experience. I will come again I had a bad experience at Scorpion Bar when I noticed the bartenders were leaking extra money beyond the intended tip. It feels dishonest, and I hope management addresses this issue to ensure customers aren\u2019t being taken advantage of. Won\u2019t be returning until it's resolved. If your looking for a place to do a birthday dinner or large gathering it\u2019s great place(reserve a table a head of time tho!) but the food,the atmosphere and drinks was really good over all! Ik the reviews has mix of the club experience and the food(I can\u2019t say much about the club experience but the food, the stuff are amazing! You won\u2019t be disappointed.The places is aesthetically pleasing as well(go get your cute pictures for insta\ud83d\ude02.\nAlso Their Burritos are MASSIVE LIKE your not going to finish it.definitely coming back! So much flavor! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf2e\ud83c\udf79\n\nWe started with a spicy margarita, you could really taste the fresh lime. \ud83c\udf4b My husband was sweating from the spice, but I loved it!\n\nThe pork belly and Korean beef tacos were absolute standouts. \ud83d\udc37\ud83e\udd69 The verde salsa was fantastic, though it\u2019s served with \u201cbreak-your-own\u201d chips. The unexpected highlight? The cucumber side. Unbelievably flavorful and refreshing! \ud83e\udd52\u2728\n\nWe\u2019d recommend skipping the street corn on the cob \ud83c\udf3d it was missing flavor and that grilled flair we were hoping for.\n\nBack to the tacos: the pork belly was amazing, and the table rojo sauce added the perfect finishing touch. \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf2e Very seaport vibes, great ahi tuna stuff. Would highly recommend if you're in the area, probably one of the more nice, rustic places to eat out at. Great for casual work meetings and first dates.\nI think this place is probably better for eating the fish stuff. We had such a fabulous time here at Bar Taco, we felt welcomed immediately when we got in and service was fast and food was so good! The manager, Hollywood, went above and beyond to make sure we had a good time. It was our daughter\u2019s birthday and he was so sweet to send us desserts to celebrate. Highly recommend this place at all times! This place had a beautiful atmosphere with very welcoming service. The plantains were good. The pistachio cauliflower tacos were great as well but could have used a little more flavor. Limited options though if you are vegetarian. Would recommend if you\u2019re in the area! Great variety of tacos, love that you can just order singles. Fresh and descent flavor. My BF liked having the option of corn off the cob. Sat at the bar with excellent service no pressure to order drinks. Four stars as food menu is not diverse enough for me to come back often. It was crowded for Saturday lunch with surprising number of strollers. Felt a bit crowded generally but still a great place if you want to grab a quick bite or relax. Can\u2019t speak to digital ordering since we simply checked selections off the paper. A cute and healthy alternative for a quick meal! The guy that served us was super sweet and gave really good portions. I got the farro with broccoli, mac and cheese, and tofu (extra). The inside is clean and quiet, the perfect casual date spot! Will be going back! This was my first time here, and I'm really disappointed with the food. The salmon was dry, tough, and too salty. The sweet potatoes weren\u2019t cooked all the way through. The only things that were decent were the rice and broccoli. I wasted almost $16 on this meal. Love this place (and even the cashier at the Trader Joe\u2019s across the street vouched for it when we went for groceries after)!\n\nWe were looking for a healthy tasty food option in Boston during our visit, and this place delivered just what we were looking for.\n\nThe staff was also very friendly, accommodating, and customer service oriented.\n\nWe \u201cdig\u201d it! Ordered through door dash but honestly best food I\u2019ve had in a while. 10/10 would recommend any day of the week especially if you want to feel full but not regret what you ate. One of my go to healthy and low key places near Seaport. Close enough to be easily accessible, but far away to be actually reasonably priced Nut allergy friendly: Everything we ordered was fine.\n\nOrder - to - Appetizers: 15 Minutes\nOrder - to - Entrees: 40 Minutes\n\nWe walked in on a Monday night with a group of about 12 after having a reservation messed up somewhere else. Thankfully, Pink Taco had the space by putting some tables together. There are a variety of seating options here, from circle tables to bar seating to normal larger tables.\n\nThe food was overall okay. Overpriced if anything. The appetizers were adequately sharable and if I came back I'd just get some nachos to share. $20-$30+ (with tax and tip) for three tacos is absurd, and they are not that filling. My margarita pitcher was around $60 after tax and tip and served about nine small drinks - I'm still not sure if it was more efficient, with the amount of ice they gave.\n\nService was not great either. I had to go up to the bar for water refills and to get cups for people when they combined tables and forgot to set one of them. We got chip refills once for the entire table of 12. First time visit, we made a reservation.  Surprised that it wasn't overly busy but it was a Thursday. Nevertheless,  the place is very clean, and airy. The venue  offers at least one room for a private event. We were greeted, seated and immediately attended to by our server.  She was very accommodating as we had an infant in our party and another in our party has a gluten sensitivity.  While they did not offer a GF menu, our server was well versed, and was sure to ask the right questions.  The Specialty drinks were creative and very tasty.  When the food arrived it was hot and very good. I enjoy fajitas and opted for the chicken.  They did not disappoint.  The tacos were also a hit among our group.  Well worth a visit.  The location is very convenient if you are visiting the Seaport. This place is fantastic. A part of my order got messed up and they went way out of their way to make it right. Besides that, the food and the staff are amazing. I recommend the Pink Taco to anyone in the mood for Mexican cuisine. Thank you! Very nice place with nice people working there. They cook really good food and make everything very enjoyable. We like the burritos and tacos a lot! It is a great place to stop by for some authentic Mexican cousine. Stopped in by myself for lunch and was quickly seated. I was very worried when no one stopped by to even get me water for about 15 minutes. But as soon as they realized, they more than made up for it. For the rest of the time, my drink and food were received quickly and I was checked in often. The chips and salsa were fresh, my enchiladas were delicious, and I enjoyed the pineapple agua fresca although the pineapple chunks do make it hard to drink through a straw! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\nThis was our fourth visit to SAVR in the past year, and it has officially become our favorite spot for sea bass. The dish is perfection, with flavors that melt in your mouth, and the consistency across visits is commendable. While we were slightly disappointed not to receive the complimentary bread this time, we\u2019re hoping it was just an oversight. The food arrived promptly, maintaining the restaurant\u2019s reputation for efficient service, and the stunning waterfront views elevated the experience further. SAVR continues to impress, and we\u2019ll be back soon! This is an absolute must when in Boston! We had started our meal with the espresso martini flight that lead to excellent entrees. Our server Daniel was honestly the highlight of our evening! The ambiance.. the food\u2026 the drinks\u2026 the service. Absolutely everything was perfect THANK YOU! Located right on the water in downtown seaport. Beautiful spot with a view of the water at every seat. We came on a Friday night and were very lucky to snag seats at the bar. We ordered an espresso martini sampler (A MUST TRY) and a few other cocktails. We came back twice in one night it was that great! Shoutout to Daniel our bartender can\u2019t wait to come back and see him again! Have been here a few times for brunch/lunch. Can get quite busy for brunch depending on when you go, but the service is consistent and solid.\n\nMy favorites so far are actually the burger, and the giant profiteroles are just delightful. Will try more of the brunch options in the future, but so far everything I\u2019ve had here has been consistently good. The side dishes (broccolini, fries) are actually quite exceptional.\n\nThe views are great, though the place is actually a bit smaller on the inside than expected. Will definitely be returning and trying out the dinner menu soon. Top Restaurant, Top Service, and excellent food!!\nMy steak filet was one of the best in my last time.\nThe location is very nice in the South of Boston, one of the best places \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udfff\nThank you for all and best regards to the kitchen please \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff \ud83d\ude0a Lovely location in a lively area. You can people watch, sit with friends, or sit alone in the cozy setup. Coffee was Caff\u00e8 Nero's usual consistently good coffee. I had a double Espresso Con Panna where the cream was the real whipped cream that's not sweet, as it should be. This coffee house is an absolute gem! It\u2019s the perfect spot to enjoy a delicious sweet treat while savoring a well-crafted coffee. With a wide variety of options and a warm, inviting atmosphere, it\u2019s an ideal place to relax and unwind. The ginger guy working there? I guess he just clocked into his shift. But he made my iced matcha latte and it was just straight milk. I\u2019ve been craving a matcha and just super disappointed with this. Prosciutto mascarpone sandwich is ok. Tasty but dry. Good coffee, amazing atmosphere, and friendly service!\n\nI tried their hot latte with full-fat milk, it was decent. But what really stands out is the cozy ambiance and helpful staff. A perfect spot for a relaxing afternoon coffee with a book or meeting up with friends.\n\nThe place is usually bustling, but I noticed that the outdoor seating area needed cleaning. I suggest they improve it, especially since it's a great spot to enjoy the sun these days Great caf\u00e8 with great caff\u00e8. It just wasn\u2019t too special. The coffee was good but if you\u2019re looking to buy beans this isn\u2019t the place, no roast dates, just \u201cBest By:\u201d dates. I got a cappuccino and an egg salad croissant. The cappuccino was made the Italian or old fashioned style (heavily steamed milk), so if that\u2019s your style it\u2019s really good. The croissant on the other hand was probably the best egg salad \u201csomething\u201d I ever had, so high praise for that. The staff at this coffee shop was quite friendly, which I appreciated.\nWhile the latte didn't quite meet my expectations given the price point, I understand that crafting the perfect cup is an art form.\nThe food offerings were adequate, though there may be room for improvement.\nPerhaps I have high standards when it comes to my coffee experience, but I believe attention to detail can make all the difference. This place has very little parking but is fully accessible and pretty massive inside!\n\nThey have Harney & Sons bottled teas (my favorite), Natalie\u2019s juices, waters, pre-made salads and yogurt, grab-and-go chips, and more.\n\nThey use bagels from Iggies, which, their rolls are phenomenal\u2026the multigrain bagels were the texture of a roll, not a bagel.  Good but not what I want in a bagel.\n\nThe eggs weren\u2019t single eggs, but looked poured from a container, and the avocado is smushed and likely from a jar, not a fresh avocado.\n\nI don\u2019t pushed my sandwich had more cheese too, as the slice was super thin.\n\nOverall it was not a sandwich I\u2019d get again, but I did like the place itself, and would go back to try other things.\n\nIt was also affordable.  My egg sandwich was $8 ish. My friend and put kids came here after the aquarium\nThe was one guy working behind the counter and boy did he kill it got busy suddenly and he was so kind and quick. The Food was awesome and there was a nice big table in the back we could all relax and hangout at? My husband has the best croissant he's ever tasted. Sorelle is a great little coffee shop / bakery in the Seaport area with solid breakfast food and coffee. It was very convenient to visit each morning during our stay at the InterContinental. This bakery is right around the corner from the hotel. Our go to place in Boston to grab some delicious breakfast and coffee . Their sandwich is always fresh and nutritious . My fav is Avocado toast sandwich . If you in Boston and would like to have some healthy  breakfast I will def recommend this bakery !! The staff members at this Starbucks are incredible and kind. Regardless of the day or time - going to the Starbucks at this location is always a nice experience.\nShoutout to Gerson and the team. Always smiling, remember names, remember orders. Attention to detail is amazing. Nice work team! My drink was ok. I\u2019d like to mention its customer service. I asked an associate to use my SB points for payment. On my way to exit I noticed that they charged my card balance instead. The associate did not say anything, no apologies. She just asked her colleague to resolve this. Her colleague also was super indifferent. So my one star to this place is for customer service. The service is bad for being in a seaport location. This location was did not have a lot of people there but maybe because of the mobile orders the baristas kept telling all customers to go the other seaport Starbucks bc they couldn't take any more orders for 20 minutes. Later in the day we went again and same thing, service was slow, all we ordered was a brownie and they forgot to put in the oven, everyone before me got their order. And they started telling people to go the other Starbucks location I want to highlight the wonderful employee, Gerson. He made my early morning warm and bright, you clearly hire great folks at this location My wife and I stopped there Saturday evening 7/20/24. I wish I had gotten there names but there was a young woman and man working there and they could not have been nicer. They not only made the drinks to perfection, but were courteous and even engaged / were sweet to our 3yr old daughter. A stark contrast to what we've seen at other locations. General:\n- Great concept , good value for money, but has a long way to go.\n\nCoffee:\nTasted decent enough but it's not in Blue-Botte-Coffee league.\nHowever, it tasted better than Starbucks Pike-Roast.\nCoffee  is light, not bitter or sweet just in between.\nPrice under $3 for a medium size cup.\n\nService:\nFelt transactional ,  staff was not rude but not engaging either.\n\nOverall:\nThis not Starbucks or Blue-Bottel-Coffee competitor. Not recommended, not worth it. This place ruins the nice coffee beans. Overly extracted coffee with uncleared portafilter. Plus, extremely unfriendly employee. Rarely open.never more than 1 worker. Unwelcoming signs : seats for whole foods staff. 45 minutes only!  Steel counter with high chairs half into the walking space to the Amazon pick up. Not welcoming, not friendly. Coffee in plastic  cups. And the coffee is, well, maybe a 2 star. Should be deleted and space used for Amazon pick-up because  they need it and will make good use of the space. Good coffee, nice setting (the coffee machine is beneath the counter which makes the appearance clean, good location (within While foods, right at the entrance)\nCappuccino I had was ok\nGood job guys Closes at 2:30pm not 4pm. Time on here is misleading. Biked all the way downtown to try to catch it before 4pm, only to be mistaken. The guy who took our order and the woman had a terrible attitude and were very mean. Plus we tried using a free pastry and coffee code and they charged us for it. The food tasted like liquid diarea. Got ourselves a couple of large cups of hot chocolate to go on the cold night of Nov 30th with temperatures of 32 degrees outside.. Best decision ever! This place is super esthetic and cozy. The drink was great and didn't take overly long to get. Highly recommend! Super chill location. Luxurious seating options. Friendly staff. Atmosphere was like 7 out of 5. In Downtown Crossing, where fast-fashion chains and smartphone zombies reign supreme, there's a peculiar oasis of faux-Italian charm called Caff\u00e8 Nero. Yes, it's a chain,  the kind that dots every corner of London like pigeons, but this one, wedged into 560 Washington Street, has developed its own strange ecosystem.\n\nThe space is a beautiful bastard child of industrial Boston and European pretension. Exposed brick walls and steel ducts loom above, while below, an almost comically eclectic collection of furniture looks like it was raided from a Victorian estate sale. Leather wingbacks with enough button tufting to make a duchess blush sit next to wooden tables that have seen more MacBooks than actual books.\n\nThe lighting is pure theater: Edison bulbs dangling like costume jewelry, casting that perfect \"I'm-being-productive-in-public\" glow that every freelance writer and remote coder seems to crave. And crave they do. From 6:30 AM on weekdays (7 AM if you're a weekend warrior), the place fills with a parade of caffeinated characters, each claiming their territory with laptops and keep-cup thermoses like urban homesteaders.\n\nThe food? It's surprisingly not terrible. Their display case is a United Nations of grab-and-go options. The Winter Chicken Cobb could actually pass for real food, and their sandwiches, stacked high behind fingerprint-smudged glass, are honest attempts at sustenance rather than the usual sad caf\u00e9 fare.

Those you'll have to find yourself, somewhere between the fake vintage furniture and the very real need for caffeine that brought you here in the first place. The staff members at this Starbucks are incredible and kind. Regardless of the day or time - going to the Starbucks at this location is always a nice experience.\nShoutout to Gerson and the team. Always smiling, remember names, remember orders. Attention to detail is amazing. Nice work team! My drink was ok. I\u2019d like to mention its customer service. I asked an associate to use my SB points for payment. On my way to exit I noticed that they charged my card balance instead. The associate did not say anything, no apologies. She just asked her colleague to resolve this. Her colleague also was super indifferent. So my one star to this place is for customer service. The service is bad for being in a seaport location. This location was did not have a lot of people there but maybe because of the mobile orders the baristas kept telling all customers to go the other seaport Starbucks bc they couldn't take any more orders for 20 minutes. Later in the day we went again and same thing, service was slow, all we ordered was a brownie and they forgot to put in the oven, everyone before me got their order. And they started telling people to go the other Starbucks location I want to highlight the wonderful employee, Gerson. He made my early morning warm and bright, you clearly hire great folks at this location My wife and I stopped there Saturday evening 7/20/24. I wish I had gotten there names but there was a young woman and man working there and they could not have been nicer. They not only made the drinks to perfection, but were courteous and even engaged / were sweet to our 3yr old daughter. A stark contrast to what we've seen at other locations. General:\n- Great concept , good value for money, but has a long way to go.\n\nCoffee:\nTasted decent enough but it's not in Blue-Botte-Coffee league.\nHowever, it tasted better than Starbucks Pike-Roast.\nCoffee  is light, not bitter or sweet just in between.\nPrice under $3 for a medium size cup.\n\nService:\nFelt transactional ,  staff was not rude but not engaging either.\n\nOverall:\nThis not Starbucks or Blue-Bottel-Coffee competitor. Not recommended, not worth it. This place ruins the nice coffee beans. Overly extracted coffee with uncleared portafilter. Plus, extremely unfriendly employee. Rarely open.never more than 1 worker. Unwelcoming signs : seats for whole foods staff. 45 minutes only!  Steel counter with high chairs half into the walking space to the Amazon pick up. Not welcoming, not friendly. Coffee in plastic  cups. And the coffee is, well, maybe a 2 star. Should be deleted and space used for Amazon pick-up because  they need it and will make good use of the space. Good coffee, nice setting (the coffee machine is beneath the counter which makes the appearance clean, good location (within While foods, right at the entrance)\nCappuccino I had was ok\nGood job guys Closes at 2:30pm not 4pm. Time on here is misleading. Biked all the way downtown to try to catch it before 4pm, only to be mistaken. The guy who took our order and the woman had a terrible attitude and were very mean. Plus we tried using a free pastry and coffee code and they charged us for it. The food tasted like liquid diarea. Got ourselves a couple of large cups of hot chocolate to go on the cold night of Nov 30th with temperatures of 32 degrees outside.. Best decision ever! This place is super esthetic and cozy. The drink was great and didn't take overly long to get. Highly recommend! Super chill location. Luxurious seating options. Friendly staff. Atmosphere was like 7 out of 5. In Downtown Crossing, where fast-fashion chains and smartphone zombies reign supreme, there's a peculiar oasis of faux-Italian charm called Caff\u00e8 Nero. Yes, it's a chain,  the kind that dots every corner of London like pigeons, but this one, wedged into 560 Washington Street, has developed its own strange ecosystem.\n\nThe space is a beautiful bastard child of industrial Boston and European pretension. Exposed brick walls and steel ducts loom above, while below, an almost comically eclectic collection of furniture looks like it was raided from a Victorian estate sale. Leather wingbacks with enough button tufting to make a duchess blush sit next to wooden tables that have seen more MacBooks than actual books.\n\nThe lighting is pure theater: Edison bulbs dangling like costume jewelry, casting that perfect \"I'm-being-productive-in-public\" glow that every freelance writer and remote coder seems to crave. And crave they do. From 6:30 AM on weekdays (7 AM if you're a weekend warrior), the place fills with a parade of caffeinated characters, each claiming their territory with laptops and keep-cup thermoses like urban homesteaders.\n\nThe food? It's surprisingly not terrible. Their display case is a United Nations of grab-and-go options. The Winter Chicken Cobb could actually pass for real food, and their sandwiches, stacked high behind fingerprint-smudged glass, are honest attempts at sustenance rather than the usual sad caf\u00e9 fare. They've even managed to nail that perfect bread consistency that won't tear your gums to shreds, a rare victory in the chain coffee shop sandwich wars.\n\nSpeaking of coffee: yes, they serve it, and yes, it will keep you vertical. But you're not here for a life-changing espresso experience.

Those you'll have to find yourself, somewhere between the fake vintage furniture and the very real need for caffeine that brought you here in the first place. In case anyone was wondering how the Silver Line works, it's a bus that drives in its own tunnel. That being said, it runs as quickly and as regularly than the usually T trains, if not better. This station is pretty empty but very clean. the Inside is nice and plenty big but doesnt have enough signage of where you are going the front lobby is HUGE so you cant really tell if you are going left or right it has 2 seperate Gates. also has WAYY too many stairs to go down for its size therefore making you miss many busses because of this layout also it  ALWAYS leaks and has puddles everywhere on both platforms and you cannot cross the busway making you go up another STEEP set of stairs ( or the escalator which is just as bad and time consuming) so by the time you reach either side your bus has left and you MAY wait SEVERAL minutes for the next which WILL NOT matter which Bus comes the SL1 2, and 3 are ALL the same and come when they want to. do yourself a favor and ONLY come here if you need to go beyond South Station( Outbound) to get there itself is actually longer using this line when it only takes the SAME amount of time as you would sit here and wait its only 2 blocks away 10-12 minutes ( less when the traffic is light) apart from that its a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!! stay away not worth it especially if you need to get to work or somewhere on time GOOD LUCK! Clean and indoor. However, this should be marked a flag stop because the  buses on the way to south station don\u2019t actually stop to check for passengers. Underground bus station on the silver line, easy to spot from the street. Not really staffed but there are ticket vending machines. Great location. Most of the Shops and restaurants are recently built. Easily accessible through silver line. I live about a 3 minute walk from this place. Lucky's is a fun place. They have a Comedy show and Trivia. I hadn't eaten there until a few weeks ago. The Calamari was good. I only eat Seafood and Poultry so I was surprised at the quality. Now..... Now... Ok, for, me, this place; I would frequent at least Weekly. It's a MAJOR bummer because of the smell there that comes from the Bathrooms. I had to hold my breath several times, the one time that I ate there. It was gross. I would never eat there again. I did go there again, didn't eat, just watched a show at The Bar, but, same smell.\n\nThat being said, after I get off of work, sometimes I feel like going out, but, not driving or getting really dressed up, just wanting to go to a nice Neighborhood spot. Last Monday, I thought, OH! Lucky's.. then remembered the smell. I just didn't end up going. Lucky's.... Maybe contact Boston Water and Sewer? Complain to The Landlord, Building Management? You're loosing money because of that smell.... We went here for a night cap after visiting the holiday market in Seaport and ended up staying for 3 drinks! The vibe with the red lighting, the old photos, being partially underground, it was all very neat. Our bartender who called himself \"Shamus\", but came up as \"John\" on our receipt was a hoot. He definitely knew how to get a rise out of customers (or put them in their place with some snark if they had one too many).\n\nI told Shamus that I was picky about my dirty martinis and his was the best one I've ever had next to the one my husband makes me; he told me \"put that on yelp, eh?!\" but I'm putting it on here because I haven't read a yelp review since 2010. My husband had a classic old fashioned and it was absolutely perfect.\n\nWe had their bar food special that night which was chicken tenders - they were delicious -- all white meat, moist and appeared to be either hand breaded or just really good quality -- the sauce was delicious, and you can't go wrong with $1 tendies! Everyone else was ordering their pizza which also looked excellent.\n\nI'd highly recommend stopping here for a fun, old school speakeasy vibe, good drinks, and some delicious bar food! Loved this place. Great happy hours that rotate most days. Fun place to drink. Live music was actually solid and fun to sing along with.\n\nDelicious burgers and chicken tenders that remind me of Raising Cane's. Highly recommend. Bar staff is friendlier on the front half vs the back half. Lucky's is an awesome spot with great drinks, burgers, and a fun atmosphere. The service is always excellent, and Manny\u2019s exceptional hospitality, in particular, is a big reason I keep coming back and bringing friends. Highly recommend Lucky's to anyone visiting Seaport - great vibes all around! This place has solid burgers and solid drinks. It\u2019s my go to late night spot if I\u2019m ever in Seaport. The people are nice and sometimes the music selection is good. It\u2019s a great time if you want causal drinks with friends."

    "reviews": "From this location I get pizza by the slice. Buffalo chicken pizza is great with the ranch. Also have gotten the fisherman's platter, quite a bit of shrimp and scallops with the fish! The steak and pepper dinner plate is WICKED! Comes with rice and a side salad I ordered a cheese lasagna, what I received was a bowl of tomato sauce with some cheese and pasta. It was the worst lasagna I had ever attempted to eat, there was so much sauce,  I filled a half bowl of it ..straight up gross!! If you\u2019re looking for a solid, dependable Italian spot with homemade food and generous portions- look no further!\n\nAlfredo\u2019s has a few locations and all of them are solid and do not disappoint. A huge menu of homemade pizzas, hot/cold sandwiches, appetizers, wings, pasta dinners, salads and so much more. The menu is massive and there is something for everyone.\n\nI\u2019ve eaten here multiple times via delivery. It always arrives packaged well, fresh, and piping hot. I\u2019ve ordered everything from pasta, to lasagna, to sandwiches. Everything is solid. The portions are generous. A pasta dinner easily feeds two people. A homemade meatball sub easily can make two meals.\n\nI will dive into a few of my favorites from Alfredo\u2019s. First, the Homemade Meatball Parmigiana Sub. Generously sized homemade meatballs with sauce and cheese on a sub roll. Meatballs are moist and delicious, not dry like many places.\n\nFor pasta fans, the Chicken Piccata is phenomenal and is large enough for two. Pasta, chicken, capers, lemons, & artichokes in a wine garlic sauce. This is served over a generous portion of linguine.\n\nThe cheese lasagna is also another favorite. It is a huge order, easily would feed 2-3. I suggest a side order of meatballs to go with it. They include fresh baked dinner rolls to enjoy with it.\n\nBeing from Chicago, I\u2019m big on pizza and wings. See, in Chicago deep dish is for tourists. We prefer thin crust. It\u2019s a little known secret. Therefore, I absolutely love the pizza here. It is super thin, almost Neapolitan style. Quality ingredients and they don\u2019t skimp. Always arrives hot and fresh.\n\nThe wings are also very tasty. They are different than what you\u2019d get at some of the popular chain-style wing spots. These have a crispy breading and inside is hot and juicy. I got the regular chicken wings without sauce and they had plenty of flavor. They certainly are a different style wing, but still very good.\n\nWe ordered in for delivery and took advantage of the Medium Pizza deal that comes with wings or tenders (we did wings) and a 2-Liter of your choice. For $28 it\u2019s a bit pricy, but the portion size more than makes up for it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a dependable, delicious, local Italian take-out/delivery spot you MUST give Alfredo\u2019s a try. The menu is massive and there is something for every taste. I haven\u2019t had a bad thing there yet! Pasta primavera was not good at all. It was swimming in a larger pool of water (no, it wasn\u2019t oil or garlic etc). Ziti didn\u2019t appear or taste homemade, and the carrots were still hard. Zero flavor due to the water. Bread was very good tho but will never return. Great pizza at an amazing price. We ordered a large meat lovers, and it was more than enough for 2, and less than $20. The ingredients were reasonable quality and it was hot and fresh upon pickup. What more can you ask for? Also, they may have the largest and most robust menu I have every seen, it is a sight to behold. Lincoln Tavern & Restaurant was an excellent dining experience! My friend and I had a great time trying their delicious desserts, which were the perfect sweet finish to our meal. The burgers were juicy and flavorful, with perfectly melted cheese and fresh toppings. We also enjoyed some fantastic meat dishes, including a perfectly cooked steak that was tender and packed with flavor. The casual yet vibrant atmosphere made it a great spot for a fun night out, and the service was friendly and attentive. We definitely left satisfied and will be back soon! Great restaurant, with an even better appetizer menu. I enjoyed the wine and the French onion soup the most. Shandon was our bartender and she was very helpful with local recommendations and she provided great service. I enjoyed my time at the restaurant and will be back. The food was amazing. We had french toast, eggs Benedict biscuits and gravy and a breakfast pizza.  There were ample portions, almost too much. The noise was the only issue.  They need noise dampening panels. We had a great lunch here. Large and simple space. The slider appetizer was delicious and I tried the Al pastor pizza which was very good as well. I would definitely come back if I was in the Boston area. We just had take out and it was so delicious!! I really appreciate the way Lincoln Tavern prepares a variety of dishes. I had the blackened chicken with pasta for the first time tonight and it was perfect. Not heavy just delicious.  Their kale salad is one of my favorites.  My husband had the light and tasty fish and chips.  Great job!! We really enjoyed the ambiance of this restaurant. A lot of seating in both the front and back, and a long bar. The service was very good, and they offered lots of food choices, even for those with celiac. They had multiple gluten-free pasta shapes to choose from.\nThe restaurant is a bit loud because of acoustics, so it might be slightly difficult to have an actual conversation without shouting. Came here for Valentine\u2019s Day and had an amazing meal !!! Highly recommend this place, I\u2019ve always heard very good things and I\u2019m so happy I got a chance to try it out! The drinks were good and so were the pasta dishes we got! The bread was so fresh and the oil was the best!!! Had a good dinner at Capo\u2019s the other night.  I was impressed at the size and aesthetic of this place as I didn\u2019t realize how large the inside was. Food was also good, but I warn anyone who wants to dine here in the colder months, DO NOT let the staff sit you in the 6 4- seated tables in the front of the restaurant.\n\nI want to compliment the service, which was timely and friendly. We had an excellent waitress.\n\nThe food came quickly, though the fried calamari wasn\u2019t my cup of tea. They were nicely beer battered and super crisp. However, the size of these calamari were fairly large resulting in a crunchy, but very rubbery appetizer. Would only recommend if you don\u2019t mind that type of texture. We did not finish it.\n\nThe main dishes on the other hand were delicious. Hardy portions, good flavor, and a creative spin. My truffle fusili was very well done.\n\nDessert was also tasty. Gelato is great and the torta di chocolate will blow  you away. It is incredible.\n\nThis meal would 100% have been even better ifmy group and I weren\u2019t freezing cold every time the front door opened. There is no blower or additional heat source in the front, so every time someone came in or left, which was frequent, we and the other 5 tables would be blown around by the draft and freezing weather.\n\nI also noticed that pick up orders were placed in the  foyer area which itself was fairly chilly, so anyone getting delivery shouldn\u2019t be surprise dif their food is cold upon arrival.\n\nI would highly recommend this spot if you want a fun night out or a good meal, just do not let anyone sit you by the front seating area during the winter. Makes for a really unpleasant experience. loved this variation of an espresso martini with the house made whipped cream. the pizza was very good, probably the only highlight. the calamari was awful, it just looked strange and wasn\u2019t very good at all, don\u2019t recommend it. Capo Tuesday nights is a celiacs dream. Some of the best food I have ever had, so good you would never know it\u2019s gluten free. My non celiac partner agreed! The arancini is insanely good. I had an amazing time playing pickleball at PKL Boston! The event was organized by a Harvard student organization, and it was such a great experience. This was my first time playing pickleball, and the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly\u2014they really made me feel welcome and gave me courage to get started. The facility was well-maintained and had a great vibe. I definitely recommend checking it out if you're looking to try something new and have fun! I'll definitely be back! I didn\u2019t try any of the food here, but I came to play pickleball for the first time and really enjoyed it! Can\u2019t wait to come back here and play more. The group instructor Matt was great at giving tips and explaining the rules. Not sure about the parking situation though.\n\nUpdate 6/5: just tried the Pig Beach pop up and it was FANTASTIC. Great service (shoutout to Grace for being super sweet and helpful with food suggestions!) and the food itself was phenomenal. I hope they stay for good because I\u2019d definitely go back. This place is perfect for pickleball enthusiasts. The courts are in excellent condition, providing a comfortable space to play at any time. But what really stands out is the food the burgers are juicy, the wings have an unbeatable flavor, and the ribs are tender and delicious. Each dish is prepared with fresh, high-quality ingredients, making the dining experience truly memorable. Additionally, the staff is always attentive and friendly, ensuring your visit is excellent both on and off the court.Definitely a great spot to enjoy with the family, with great sport and amazing food. This place is HUGE and a perfect venue for get togethers and special occasions. Had a baby shower event for a friend here and I have to say it was unprecedented to celebrate to the backdrop of competitive pickleball grunts and loud bass music :) Their Lady Gaga cocktail was surprisingly tasty! We went for Fathers Day 2024 to surprise my dad. We had the BEST time. Drove just about an hr to get there and was not disappointed at all. Everyone was fun, positive, and helpful. Def somewhere we will go back to especially in the winter!! Had a fine dinner here which was good, but nothing special. Ultimately, it\u2019s just solid rotisserie chicken and some good sauces. We enjoyed the spinach & artichoke dip and the tuna crispy rice bites, but aren\u2019t necessarily rushing to go back. It wasn\u2019t too expensive either, which was nice. Lovely brunch. The staff is so friendly. Highly recommend the grilled banana bread with maple-Orange butter. And the chicken benedict. Very accommodating for gluten free too. Skip the latte that has cardamom. After a great WFH experience at Shy Bird Fenway, I was excited to visit their Southie location. The bar was set pretty high by Fenway so I was left mildly disappointed.\n\nEveryone at the Fenway location was super welcoming and friendly, and our server was attentive and went above and beyond. Compared to our experience at Southie, where the hostess seemed like she couldn't care less about being there. There was only one server when we came in around 11am on a Tuesday, and she was also making drinks so it took a while for us to be able to place an order.\n\nI got the Chicken Shawarma Pita, which was decent for a non-Mediterranean restaurant. It came with a huge side of fries, which were nice and crispy. After trying both their WFH breakfast and lunch menus, I'd probably only come back for breakfast.\n\nThe space itself is large and has a lot of natural sunlight. It was thoughtful of them to close some of the shades when the sun got too bright though. There are also clean restrooms, fast wifi, and outlets spread out around for easy access. Extraordinary food!  The best Ranch Fried chicken, the fried chicken Ceasars wrap and the best ever Spicy Chipotle bowl!  If you haven\u2019t been here, it\u2019s definitely a must stop! Jacob was a wonderful server! Steven was our server and was absolutely phenomenal. My partner and I went for my birthday dinner, he treated us every step of the way. It's always a little things, and he came out with treats along the way to make it very special. Dinah the bartender was also equally amazing, she came over with complementary birthday drinks to help us celebrate, came afterwards to see how they were. Great service, great food, great chatting with the people there, can't wait to go back!"

I was placing my order and lady at a counter asked me where I\u2019m from. I answered that I\u2019m from Ukraine. She started talk to me in russian, and insisted that I have to talk russian language to her. I answered I prefer to talk in English. That moment her face becomes angry and she turn around and was talking something about Ukrainian/russian quietly. In the end I said \u201cThank you \u201c and she just throw my order on a counter, it slides there.\nI\u2019m grateful Polish people for their support and I always support Polish business in Boston. I\u2019ll share this terrible customer service at Baltic with everyone, because it\u2019s not only language question, it has way more deeper meaning and that Polish employee knew that. I\u2019m so excited to discover this store! I came for one exact product but ended up with two bags full of goodies! Looking forward to coming back there and trying more stuff! Walking in for the first time, the ladies showed me all their prepared foods and offered to any up for me. The cheese blintzes were so good I ate them all in my car. The smoked sausages were amazing, and the ladies recommended how to store and use them best. I see myself coming back weekly! Great place! I went here to pick up a few things. The woman working at the deli was very friendly and helpful. I got Lithuanian bread, pickle soup, and a layered cake. It is a very nice place to purchase ethnic and authentic Polish and Lithuanian foods. Awesome spot!"

    "reviews": "There is always a half empty milk jug in this place lol. Every single time I go in, there is a half empty milk jug. Every. Single. Time.\n\nThe first time I noticed this, about seven months ago, the cashier completely ignored me when I told him. He did not even acknowledge that I said it. I repeated it to him at the counter but gave me absolutely zero response.\n\nI took a photo this time on my recent trip. I'm giving five stars because the place is convenient and the half empty milk jugs bring amusement to my mundane life. And as a bonus, there was even an empty milk jug behind the half empty one this time! Never been to a 7-11 that doesn\u2019t have a slurpee machine! I spent $80 dollars at this location and they refused to let me use the on-site restroom. \"Not for customers.\" they said, in broken English. The cashier blatantly ignored me and did not do their job properly. I bought three cans of 12 oz monster since there was a promotion in which 3/$5.50. First they did not scan all the items so the total said $2.59 for one can of monster, then they asked for $10. They took my $10 and did not give me my change. I tried to talk to them but they ignored me. Went there tonight 10-27-17-to play Mega millions-Two women cashier's BOTH didn't know how to work lottery machine-just wanted to play 20pick picks Mega million tickets for $20 on the same ticket.BOTH didnt know how to operate the Lottery machines.-PLEASE hire people that know how to work the lottery machine-My money went to another store-I will not be returning to this store no more.Thank UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER. \u2639\u2639\u2639\u2639\u2639 This is a very cute neighborhood restaurant serving hearty authentic Polish food. I recently visited Poland and the food at this restaurant is comparable to the best food I had in Poland. It is fresh, hearty and delicious. They use quality ingredients. In fact, I prefer their stuffed cabbage here to the ones I had in Poland because here it is less salty. The dumplings here also taste freshly made and perfectly seasoned, with perfect texture. Even their mashed potatoes (something you can find at most restaurants) taste amazing because it\u2019s not overly buttery and you can taste the high quality of the potato itself. The restaurant is very small and it does fill up quickly even at lunchtime (especially on weekends) so I recommend either arrive early or make a reservation. One of the best meals I\u2019ve had in a while. The Lomza honey beer was delicious, sweet like honey but overly so like some meads, it still had a nice beer taste. The Borscht was fantastic, so flavorful and rich. Finally, the Polish plate was the perfect sampler with a ton of food. Each part of it was delectable. Can\u2019t recommend this place enough. Delicious and inexpensive Polish food with a variety of meat or vegetarian options. Dining room is quiet, cute, and homey. Loved the borscht, gypsy pancake with goulash, and Kielbasa twists. Cafe Polonia catered our backyard wedding in September, and they truly exceeded our expectations. The beautifully crafted display added a special touch to our celebration. For many guests, it was their first taste of Polish cuisine. Everyone loved the delicious flavors, and we received countless compliments throughout the evening. The staff was professional and kind, making the experience even more enjoyable. We wholeheartedly recommend Cafe Polonia for any event! One of the neighborshood's finest restaurants, serving authentic polish food for over 2 decades. The space is cozy and feels like someone's home. Every dish we ordered was exquisite \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb I can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu.\n\nSupport your local business \u2728\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1f I got the brie & pepper toast and an emerald smoothie and it was insane! like SO good. nothing like i\u2019ve ever had before. the toast had a crunch abut was so soft. super cute place on the inside. the service was great right away. they definitely care a lot and it shows. definitely coming back. Yall, we stopped by this place for a quick bite on the way to our day plans, and it did not disappoint. The coffee was good and at a great price. But the breakfast sandwiches were incredible. If they ever ask you to put their secret sauce on your sandwich, say yes. It\u2019s delicious!! The service was phenomenal, and the atmosphere made everything 10x better. I\u2019ll have to come back another time to give a more fair review but this review is based on my first time coming here. Came here on a Saturday morning and was not expecting to wait almost an hour for a coffee. Got in line and waited for 45 minutes. If I had known that\u2019s how long it\u2019d take from where I was standing, I would\u2019ve left but I didn\u2019t since it was my first time. They only had one worker making all the drinks which is not feasible considering how busy they are on Saturday mornings. They really need at least two baristas. The drink itself was okay and $7 for a latte. The food did look good but didn\u2019t get to try it. I\u2019d like to come back but need to find a day and time where I wouldn\u2019t have to wait more than 15 minutes stop. I was on my way to work the other day, driving through Dorchester, and searched for smoothies near me and this wonderful hidden caf\u00e9 popped up! I don\u2019t know how I haven\u2019t discovered this, but there is so much charmed, joy and brightness here it\u2019s new favorite spot!  The smoothies are delicious and they have fun drinks and eats. The staff is wonderful although sometimes understaffed. Great laid-back coffee shop experience in South Boston.\n\nLocated in a somewhat industrial area of South Boston, Cannonball Cafe offers a refreshing escape with its vibrant and colorful decors and a relaxing patio area. Over the past few weeks, I've found myself drawn to this spot, especially on weekend mornings, to bask in its calm and inviting atmosphere. With ample street parking nearby, it was also a great hassle-free destination for driving in.\n\nCompared to other coffee shops in the city, the menu here is relatively more affordable. While it might be concise, it includes a good selection of catered pastries. One of my favorites was the Cinnamon bun with Cream cheese.\n\nFrom their other breakfast offerings, I tried the Cannonball Special sandwich, which featured crispy prosciutto, avocado, secret sauce, and Gruyere cheese.\n\nThe use of prosciutto instead of bacon lends a healthier twist, though its robust flavor tends to dominate the sandwich. Nonetheless, it was a satisfying choice for a hearty breakfast.\n\nAs for the drinks, the Chai Latte was excellent. On the other hand, the Matcha latte was a bit of a letdown, being rather bitter as it came without sugar by default.\n\nOverall, Cannonball Cafe is a great spot for a causal coffee break or breakfast. While its location may not be the most walkable, its unique charm and inviting atmosphere more than compensate for the extra effort to get there. If you\u2019re in the area looking for a refreshing pause, I would recommend giving them a try. I got the brie & pepper toast and an emerald smoothie and it was insane! like SO good. nothing like i\u2019ve ever had before. the toast had a crunch abut was so soft. super cute place on the inside. the service was great right away. they definitely care a lot and it shows. definitely coming back. Yall, we stopped by this place for a quick bite on the way to our day plans, and it did not disappoint. The coffee was good and at a great price. But the breakfast sandwiches were incredible. If they ever ask you to put their secret sauce on your sandwich, say yes. It\u2019s delicious!! The service was phenomenal, and the atmosphere made everything 10x better. I\u2019ll have to come back another time to give a more fair review but this review is based on my first time coming here. Came here on a Saturday morning and was not expecting to wait almost an hour for a coffee. Got in line and waited for 45 minutes. If I had known that\u2019s how long it\u2019d take from where I was standing, I would\u2019ve left but I didn\u2019t since it was my first time. They only had one worker making all the drinks which is not feasible considering how busy they are on Saturday mornings. They really need at least two baristas. The drink itself was okay and $7 for a latte. The food did look good but didn\u2019t get to try it. I\u2019d like to come back but need to find a day and time where I wouldn\u2019t have to wait more than 15 minutes stop. I was on my way to work the other day, driving through Dorchester, and searched for smoothies near me and this wonderful hidden caf\u00e9 popped up! I don\u2019t know how I haven\u2019t discovered this, but there is so much charmed, joy and brightness here it\u2019s new favorite spot!

If you\u2019re in the area looking for a refreshing pause, I would recommend giving them a try. Awesome addition to Andrew Square. The bar has a ton of beer and cocktails and is casual while also being stylish. The food is incredible and great with a group - giant pretzel and mozzarella stick (seriously giant, with 7 people we each got a huge piece), wings, and poutine were all awesome. Plus the staff was really friendly. Don't miss adding your Photo Booth pix to the back wall. Yes. I did not know small victories prior to their renovation, however, the handy man did his job thoroughly and extensively. What a hidden gem. Beyond friendly staff. Excellent food, all of which is made in house, and they take pride in the eats (always pays dividends)\u2026 shuffleboard and whiskey, say less. Every other week after my haircut Nextdoor, I\u2019m there. Small Victories is a great new bar located in the heart of Boston, Andrew Square.\ud83e\udd73 It being the only bar in the area it is a breath of fresh air outside your normal pizza and fries spots to eat\ud83d\ude13. I met Joe and another young lady at the front door definitely cool security staff \ud83e\udd1dand was also happily greeted at the bar by the head Chef Jeff\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73. My first choice of drink was perfect for the hot weather it\u2019s a frozen margarita named \u201cKeanu Freeze\u201d\ud83c\udf79 with multiple flavors to choose from (Strawberry, Blood Orange) my favs..great suggestion by the bar!! They\u2019re all really cool back there great friendly personalities! The first sip was a perfectly cold mix of savory flavor \ud83d\ude0b which took me a while to drink because it was strong in a great way \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe.  The \u201cBeer Honey Mustard wings\u201d \ud83c\udf57..were top notch \ud83c\udfc6extremely fresh probably the best wings I\u2019ve had in a while and the golden crispy fries just made them even better. It\u2019s a great place for Lunch, dinner or just for drinks and the game. I want to go there everytime I\u2019m in Andrew Sqaure now. Definitely worth check out.\n\nReview by: Jon Price THE BEST AROUND!!! Whether you\u2019re going for a chill night or renting it out to host a party. This is the SPOT! I just hosted my engagement party here and everyone was beyond impressed. Food is incredible and the staff are amazing. A must go. And if you haven\u2019t checked out their other bar The Quiet Few in Eastie\u2026 run, don\u2019t walk! Everything about this place is amazing. Such a hidden gem. 10/10 atmosphere, food, service, music. Loved the big pretzel"

Pasta cooked perfectly!\nSauce is absolutely delicious!\nFresh chicken breast breaded and seasoned right there! No frozen hockey pucks! Ken's salad dressing! Beautiful!\nIf it came with bread I would've never left! Great spot. I used Doughboy Donuts to cater an open house I was hosting. I placed my order ahead of time. The staff was helpful and professional. I showed up when they said the order would be ready and it was packed up all ready to go! They were just filling the box of joe. The staff had a bag all prepared with cups, lids, napkins and coffee accompaniments. I was really impressed. The service was worth the experience...but then the donuts were also GREAT! Everyone enjoyed them. I am glad we have such a great local resource in our community. Their donuts are AMAZING, and they have blueberry filled too!!!\n\nThey also have muffins and cupcakes and coffee and tea and more.\n\nThere are some cute little places to sit and the lots is free.\n\nThe building is fully accessible. Oh man. If you ever went to dunkin donuts back in the day when they had good donuts or your favorite local spot in random town USA this place is for you. We got a marble cruller which was properly hard on the outside and soft on the inside, a glazed, and a coffee Danish type thing and a decaf iced coffee. It was good enough that we'll be back on our next visit. Really cool old school vibe and they do business all day and night so everything is fresh always. Lovely staff and apparently they also do pizza right next door. Absolutely delicious. Stopped in for a quick bite. Got a small steak, cheese, mushroom, onion sub. It was fantastic! Meat was lean and cooked perfectly. The vegetables were cooked and tasty. The bread was soft enough and didn\u2019t fall apart. Very nice staff and clean restaurant. Prices were reasonable. I would definitely go again! It's hard to call this a sub shop when I just had one of the best and most authentic steak and cheese GRINDER that I would expect to come out of south. I hope I get stuck in this area again just to visit this place again. In fact, think I'll go grab one for the road. Perfect sub-shop atmosphere and dining experience! The love of family permeates the food. Great bargain for the meal served. Found this Hidden Gem \ud83d\udc8e in Southie for some Fantastic \ud83d\ude0bSteak and Cheese Sandwiches \ud83d\ude0b.  A Friendly Family Run Sandwich Shop for over 42 years Wow ! Friendly Service with Great People \ud83d\udc4d and Delicious \ud83d\ude0b Food .\nHighly Recommend Rondo's! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Great atmosphere,  very friendly staff. Cheesesteak was delicious!! The reviews speak for themselves, a true neighborhood gem in Boston. Chef Asia truly makes you feel like you\u2019re at home and brings all the dishes to you personally! I was blown away by her service and creative dishes. The food was unique and exceptional. Can\u2019t wait to come back. Best casual restaurant in Boston! Chef Asia is a comfort food genius. Every time we dine here we try new things from the menu and nothing is shy from amazing. I didn't take a pic of the burger, but it's hands down the best in town. Every month they have a special burger, I try my best to try them since they are very creative with their fillings. Chef Asia\u2019s food is magical. Ordered the crab Benedict and my partner ordered the fried rice. Both were phenomenal. Still cannot believe the effort chef puts into service bringing food to table and making connections with guests. Wait staff was amazing as well and overall was an unforgettable experience. This will be a Boston must for us on our next trip. Moonshine 152 was a great stop on our visit to the area. We went with a tapas/appetizer approach and we weren't disappointed. The jalape\u00f1o crab Rangoon were probably the best I've ever had. Scallion pancakes were really good as well. Everything was great there! We had a great time, and would definitely come back! Visited with two friends who have gluten allergies and the bartender thoroughly reviewed safe options for them to order. The chef personally brought out our dishes and confirmed everything was GF. I will definitely be going back with my hubby sometime! We meant to take a before photo of our meals, but I think the clean plates also accurately portray how amazing everything tasted \ud83e\udd24 One of my favorite place to have sushi because of their reasonable price for quality food. The food is always fresh and delicious. I\u2019m a person who eat with my eyes first so the presentation of the food deserves 10/10. We order pretty much on the menu and we love every single item. Salmon dumpling is a must try here. Drinks are fine and kinda strong though. Got a lot of food last night for our first time. Sushi is top tier, no hint of fishiness.l whatsoever. Fish tastes so amazing, velvety and succulent. Don bowl were pretty good. A little disappoint that unagi don rice was cold and doesn\u2019t feel like a warm dish. Perhaps it\u2019s my ignorance and the dish is meant to be served room temp. Karage is great but lacks a dipping sauce. Grilled squid tastes well seasoned and well grilled but can tell that it was not fresh squid and was, again, room temp and not hot off the grill. The toro tartar and oysters were definitely highlights of the evening. Crepe cake was delicious but I, personally, would not classify as crepe cake as it doesn\u2019t have the classic crepe layers that crepe cakes are known for. Would love to see other flavors outside of mango and chocolate, perhaps matcha as well. Lastly, the drinks were fantastic. 3 people last night in our party costs about $300 but we had our fill. Definitely classic upscale Boston sushi restaurant with the price tag to go with it BUT the quality is top notch. Would love temperature of the food to be tighter So happy that this place reopened. The sushi definitely is a splurge, but it is worth it for the quality and taste. The presentation is also nice. I enjoyed everything that I ordered, but the seared nigiri and sashimi balls were my favorite. The cocktails are not bad either.\n\nThe inside is very spacious. I did not need a reservation when I went for an early dinner. My server was friendly. \ud83c\udf1f This week, I had a delightful dinner at Purple Shell Sushi \ud83c\udf63 located at 11 W Broadway in South Boston, during a romantic date with my boyfriend. \ud83e\udd42\n\n\ud83c\udf79 To kick things off, I indulged in a Lychee Cocktail, which was exceptionally sweet and refreshing\u2014an easy 10/10!\n\n\ud83e\uddaa They are currently running an irresistible deal on oysters! You can get a dozen oysters for just $1 for every $100 you spend. Considering the quality of these oysters, it\u2019s an unbeatable offer.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 A standout appetizer was the Torched Miso Hamachi\u2014chopped Hamachi mixed with homemade miso sauce, topped with fired scallion. This dish was not only a cool addition to our table but also absolutely delicious and melted in the mouth, scoring a 9/10. \ud83d\udc1f\n\n\ud83e\udd62 We also savored their Duck Bao Buns. I adore a well-made bao bun; so soft and pillowy, and the Hoisin braised duck confit, coupled with cucumber and scallions, took it to the next level.\n\n\ud83c\udf04 The Sunrise Salmon Maki Roll was a fresh delight, making us crave more with every bite, a solid 9/10.\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf63 The New Torched Salmon Belly and Crispy Ohda Tempura were both knockout dishes, each earning a 10/10 from me. The crispy Ohda Tempura was particularly stunning, adorned with gold flakes!\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 Finally, we tried the Chef\u2019s Salmon Fin, an incredibly juicy dish unlike any I\u2019ve had before, garnished with a sweet sauce\u2014an 8/10.\n\n\ud83c\udf06 Overall, Purple Shell Sushi is easily one of the top Asian fusion spots I\u2019ve visited, with innovative, scrumptious dishes that make every visit a delight\u2014an effortless 10/10 overall!\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 The presentation of every dish was spectacular, adding an element of excitement as the menu constantly evolves.\n\nRatings:\nFood: \ud83c\udf74 10/10\nAmbiance: \u2728 8/10\nAffordability: \ud83d\udcb5 6/10 (Don\u2019t miss the oyster deal\u2014perfect for a group outing!) Solid upper-mid sushi spot in South Boston.\n\nAfter spotting their incredible oyster deal a few weeks ago, we decided to visit for lunch on a late Sunday afternoon. Although they were closed for a while last year, it didn't seem like much had changed since my last visit.\n\nThey were offering a dozen oysters for just a dollar with every $100 spent. While the oysters were of average quality, the deal was still incredibly enticing. Along with the oysters, we ordered the Clay Pot, which featured an array of my favorite toppings: Uni, Ikura, Toro, and Caviar. Served atop a bed of truffle rice, this appetizer was quite addictive.\n\nFrom the regular sushi selections, both the Torched Toro Maki and Surf & Turf Maki stood out. They weren't overly sauced, featured high-quality toppings, and offered a well-balanced flavor profile. The 9-piece nigiri omakase was also one of our favorites. Among sushi restaurants of a similar caliber in Boston, Purple Shell\u2019s nigiri omakase excelled. The elegantly presented toppings were thoughtfully paired with each piece and enhanced the overall experience without feeling gimmicky.\n\nOnly miss was the Chirashi Don. Despite being generously topped with fish, the pieces were too finely chopped and lacked overall flavor.\n\nAlthough Boston's sushi scene is improving, South Boston remains one of the few neighborhoods where progress seems slow. Even established spots like Purple Shell seems to struggle thriving. Nevertheless, if you're craving good-quality sushi that mostly caters to the American palate, Purple Shell will get the job done. Southern Italian in South Boston -\n\nBV is a lively, energetic, and visually appealing Resto on West Broadway. Upon entry into the foyer, you are immediately drawn into the hum of the environment, patrons milling between the two strategically located bars, the chatter amongst diners at their individual tables, all of which drives an anticipation for your food & drink.\n\nAntipasti included BV\u2019s rendition of Tuna Crudo and Grilled Octopus; fresh, delicate and lightly herbed tuna, pine nuts, & cool yoghurt, balanced by a freshly charred, amply-sized octopus with a very welcome hit of heat. Premi included the Orecchiette- which, if you are lucky enough to observe the hand-created pasta, how can you not order? This was wonderfully folded into a delectable lamb Ragu - a nice accent dish.\nSecondi included a light & fresh Cod al Forno, a beautiful Whole Branzino, and (IMO the star thus far) Veal Saltimbocca- a melt-in-your-mouth, supremely tender Tenderloin cut, delicately wrapped in thinly sliced prosciutto & served au jus. What a plate.\nWines and desserts were a blur- and only served to heighten our experience.\n\nGlad I opted for BV as an Anniversary celebration, who - kudos to BV - were kind enough to personalize our menus as takeaways. Nice touch!\n\nFinally \u2013 a key to setting the stage is their breadth and depth of Negroni offerings. I could spend a whole review talking about the quality of the crafted Negroni\u2019s, but would leave to your own experience to enjoy.\n\nCin cin! What a lovely place. The ambiance is inviting and can be romantic. The food was very delish. We started with the mussels. I enjoyed the flavor but didn't care for the mayo bread it came with. I would have preferred to have just bread and no mayo. For dinner I had the lamb ragu. It had the best flavor and was rich tasting. My friends got the truffle roast chicken. For dessert I had an espresso martini. It wasn't too bitter and tasted great. I would highly recommend this place. Very good experience at bar volpe. Service was friendly and prompt and had great suggestions.  Can defiantly get on the noisy side once 7PM hits, so be aware.Food was very good. I will definitely be coming by again to try other items on the menu. 5/5\n\nTuna crudo-\nacqua pazza, sungold tomato, chives.  A citrus water  base combined  well with yellow tomatoes and basil- although the tuna was drowned in it. It would have made the tuna soggy if I didn't eat it quickly. That being said,\nThe tuna was fresh and good quality. Good taste a slightly flawed execution  3.5/5\n\nSalted cod fritters-\nza'atar, pepperoncini aioli.  Nice and crunchy  on the outside with a nice zest. Inside you get a slight brineness  with a healthy amount of cod. The aioli add a nice sharpness to the dish. Rather yummy 4.5/5\n\nRoasted truffle chicken\nblack truffle, tuscan kale, fingerling potatoes. I was told this was the dish they are known for and that it usually sells out.  I can see why people like. The chicken skin is nice and caramelized and bursting with real truffle flavor. This soaks into the meat of the chicken, which was perfectly juicy and tender.  The kale added a nice bitterness and the potatoes were potatoes. One of the better chicken dishes I've had  5/5\n\nChocolate Peanut Butter Semifreddo\npretzel brittle, candied peanuts, valrhona satilia, cocoa nibs. Great way to end the night .  Decadent semi sweet  chocolate  paired well with the salted pretzels. I added a scoop of hazelnut icecream ,because why not.   4/5 The drinks and service were great, the ambiance was nice, and the food was tasty. Our meals did take a very long time to get to the table, but it was a Saturday night. Unfortunately, the portions are ridiculously small and overpriced\u2014I've never seen such a small portion of pasta for ~$30. Three people spent $300 and left hungry; we ended up getting a couple of pizzas at a different bar right after. Wouldn\u2019t recommend going for anything other than drinks unless you\u2019re willing to shell more out. Every moment was worth the trip! Ella (with her shadow for the shift Paige)and Matthew were very accommodating, even though we arrived quite a bit earlier than our reservation time. We started with the two amazing appetizers- the farro arancini and the crispy potato tonnato. The flavors of both were unique and craveable. I had to stop myself from licking the potato plate clean! Then onto the entr\u00e9es. My friend got the spaghetti al limone and said it was the best pasta dish she has had in a very long time. My Cod al Forno was delicate and flavorful. The only thing missing was a tiny bit of crusty bread to soak up the broth. Desserts were the perfect pair with our wine. Thank you for such a delicious meal. We have been to this restaurant a few times before but it's our first visit during the winter months. The restaurant felt cold inside and our experience was made worse since we were seated right next to the door. Every time diners entered or exited the small restaurant, cold air rushed in. We had to order hot tea to keep ourselves a little warmer.\n\nThe overall meal felt lacking in flavor, though well cooked. The one scallop in the first course was tiny. If only one scallop is in a dish, it should at least be a reasonable size to call it a course and not an amuse-bouche. The honeynut squash dish was interesting, though it was served cold, which didn't help our need for warmth. There were three small pieces of octopus in the tomato stew. The stew itself tasted mostly of just tomatoes. The menu didn't mention that the duck was a confit. We had assumed that it would be slices of duck breast. When asked about this after the plate was served, the waiter said that it depended on what parts of the duck is still available on that day. Since we don't generally like the confit texture, we didn't enjoy this dish much. Had we known this ahead of time, we would have opted for the fish option. Lastly, the cornbread in the dessert was a very small piece and was very dry and crumbly. We didn't care for this at all.\n\nWe didn't have a good night here. We had enjoyed previous meals  at this restaurant before and were looking forward to this one but the meal didn't satisfy and the cold temperature didn't help.\n\nThe wait staff, however, was great, very friendly and polite. One of them kept checking to make sure that the outside door was closed to not let in more cold air. We appreciated that. enjoyed my meal at Lenox Sophia. The restaurant is a small intimate place and I had nice conversations  with the owner and the other chef while they cooked. Super nice guys.\nFood is made with simple ingredients but is very fresh and well  executed. I plan to eat here again when the menu shifts to the autumn ingredients. I suggest trying this place out for the friendly staff and to see how simple ingredients with good execution can equal great food.\n\nScallop ceviche- came on a potato square which was nice and crunchy on outside and tender on inside. Came with a nice acidic sauce. Scallop was nice and tender. 4/5\n\nPea custard- delicious. Nice vegetative flavor flavor with just a hint of salt. The custard was nice and velvety. The whole peas had a nice bite and added good texture.  5/5\n\nRice and peas with crawfish- very simple. Scallions or green onion added a nice flavor. The rice was nicely cooked. The crawfish was nicely cooked too. 4/5\n\nLamb shoulder perfectly cooked. A Delicious savory sauce. Mushrooms added nice flavor as well 5/5\n\nStrawberry pound cake. This was a light dessert. It was not as moist as I would have liked and was a little too light on flavor- in my opinion . Left a bit to be  desired.  3.5/5 Amazing! Was in town for a conference and came here. I hadn\u2019t realized it was BYOB but the folks next to me graciously shared their wine.\n\nPre-fixe menu: $99. Both omnivore and vegetarian options! The food was absolutely amazing. I especially loved the lamb, tartare and pea custard! If you\u2019re in town or live in Boston, stop by! It's small, with maybe 8 two tops and a counter. Not a lot of ambience, but nice dishware and clean wooden lines.\nService was attentive. There were only two or three parties there.\nFood was interesting. I really enjoyed the scallops and the skate. I did not enjoy the dessert - a cornbread buckthorn berry thing.\nDon't feel the need to go back, but I did enjoy my meal. Amazing tasting menu at chefs table. Delicious flavors and lovely service. Highly recommend! Had a fine dinner here which was good, but nothing special. Ultimately, it\u2019s just solid rotisserie chicken and some good sauces. We enjoyed the spinach & artichoke dip and the tuna crispy rice bites, but aren\u2019t necessarily rushing to go back. It wasn\u2019t too expensive either, which was nice. Lovely brunch. The staff is so friendly. Highly recommend the grilled banana bread with maple-Orange butter. And the chicken benedict. Very accommodating for gluten free too. Skip the latte that has cardamom. Extraordinary food!  The best Ranch Fried chicken, the fried chicken Ceasars wrap and the best ever Spicy Chipotle bowl!  If you haven\u2019t been here, it\u2019s definitely a must stop! Jacob was a wonderful server! Steven was our server and was absolutely phenomenal. My partner and I went for my birthday dinner, he treated us every step of the way. It's always a little things, and he came out with treats along the way to make it very special. Dinah the bartender was also equally amazing, she came over with complementary birthday drinks to help us celebrate, came afterwards to see how they were. Great service, great food, great chatting with the people there, can't wait to go back! After a great WFH experience at Shy Bird Fenway, I was excited to visit their Southie location. The bar was set pretty high by Fenway so I was left mildly disappointed.\n\nEveryone at the Fenway location was super welcoming and friendly, and our server was attentive and went above and beyond. Compared to our experience at Southie, where the hostess seemed like she couldn't care less about being there. There was only one server when we came in around 11am on a Tuesday, and she was also making drinks so it took a while for us to be able to place an order.\n\nI got the Chicken Shawarma Pita, which was decent for a non-Mediterranean restaurant. It came with a huge side of fries, which were nice and crispy. After trying both their WFH breakfast and lunch menus, I'd probably only come back for breakfast.\n\nThe space itself is large and has a lot of natural sunlight. It was thoughtful of them to close some of the shades when the sun got too bright though. There are also clean restrooms, fast wifi, and outlets spread out around for easy access. went there multiples times to order A matcha latte, and 90 percent of the time they didnt add sugar, the drink was bland and no hint of matcha at all!!! I used to come here all the time because the coffee is good, but I stopped because the sandwiches are dry, bland, and thrown together like the person who made them was blindfolded. They also refrigerate them and taste like they\u2019re heated up in the microwave.\nI wanted to give them a second chance so went in one day and was off-put by one of the baristas (Siobhan) not wearing a mask, so I left. Today I was hungry so to to play it safe I ordered a grilled cheese, but when I went in, they didn\u2019t have any left. I ended up getting a different sandwich (which tasted like sand), and it took so long I was almost late for work so I didn\u2019t have time to eat it.\nIf that was the only thing that went wrong I wouldn\u2019t leave a bad review because the person who helped me was very apologetic and kind. However, the other barista Siobhan still wasn\u2019t wearing a mask, so I don\u2019t feel comfortable going to this location anymore. Removed all tables, only a few counter top spots, so mostly a grab and go location. Wish they\u2019d bring back a seating area. Friendly staff, convenient location right outside West Broadway Tstop. Service generally reliable but can be understandably slower during peak hours. Friendly staff. Pretty fast service.\nFrappuccino (Red Velvet and Green Tea) is my favorite. And they make them good.\nStore is clean and very busy in weekday morning. Great place\uff0cthere is bathroom at this starbucks which is better than a lot of the places. The drink is not that expensive too. I ordered a large Mango dragon fruit drink only for $5.40 total included tax. In other place\uff0cit cost at least 6 dollars for this large drink. So I am satisfy and it is not that far from home either. One of my favorite coffee shops in Southie! Food is always super fresh, coffee is amazing! Olga and her staff are super friendly and it\u2019s a great atmosphere to meet with friends/business for coffee! Olga\u2019s Kafe used to be in the financial district and I was a devotee for years (like walking 15 mins out of my way in Boston winters/being constantly late to my job to do so!)  If you like flavored coffees, these are the best I\u2019ve ever had and actually brewed with the flavor (i.e. no syrups or being half chocolate milk like some of the PS coffees).\n\nAlso saw some weird reviews about Olga being rude?  Insane - she\u2019s incredibly personable and I  give it up to her for being the opposite of an absentee owner (she can almost certainly afford to not be there at 6-7am almost everyday, but by your 3rd visit she knows your order and name). You\u2019re gonna be hard-pressed to find a more hands-on coffee shop owner, that\u2019s engaged with her customer base and actually has stellar coffee.  @Olga if you read this, so happy to see you found a new home, gotta make my way out to Southie because I haven\u2019t had a better coffee since you left downtown!!

The awesome staff knows our orders by heart now, and we\u2019ve really come to love and enjoy stopping in, chatting with Olga and the staff, and starting our days with our favorite double espresso with cream and 2 sugars, and an americano with cream (the dirty chai is also one of our favorites). The food is great, too. if we ever leave Boston, this will be one of the places we\u2019d miss most! One of my favorite coffee shops in Southie! Food is always super fresh, coffee is amazing! Olga and her staff are super friendly and it\u2019s a great atmosphere to meet with friends/business for coffee! Olga\u2019s Kafe used to be in the financial district and I was a devotee for years (like walking 15 mins out of my way in Boston winters/being constantly late to my job to do so!)

    "reviews": "Always a friendly staff.. Just called them, they're open till 11 - everything else is closed right now. Great peeps. Very friendly staff good \ud83d\udc4f This was my first time here and let me say when you walk in the place is absolutely gorgeous. The wait staff is attentive and everything we ate was delicious. The truffle fries are crack. I had the grilled octupus as an appetizer ( one tentacle with some potatoes and kale and some delicious sauce) and a flat bread pizza. It was awesome and a great atmosphere. Excellent service that lived up to the price point.  The pate appetizer was generous, designed to be shared.  Both the escargot and mussels were served in unconventional ways that were not  I quite as good as there more traditional counterpart\u200bs. The short rib and polenta was outstanding. $1 Oysters and $5 Ros\u00e9 on Mon-Thurs from 5-7PM. Great quality oysters, nice service, and luxurious atmosphere Excellent restaurant with great service and deep wine cellar. I enjoyed the duck which was tender and delicious. They did a great job serving our somewhat large group of 15. We had a great dining experience here! Took my wife for her birthday and they surprised us with a toast and dessert complimentary!\n\nThe food was delicious and perfectly cooked. Prices were very reasonable as well. We got the shrimp and onion soup as apps and really enjoyed both. Dinner was Steak Frites and their Sole dish, both very good.\n\nStaff was excellent. Very pleasant and attentive but not over bearing.\n\nLove the style of the restaurant, from the seating, to the bar scene, to the decor! Vibrant atmosphere. Great for groups. Servings are tapa-size, so nothing overwhelming and you could easily try other dishes without overstuffing yourself. Best grilled street corn so far\u2026 The table gets a cotton candy after a meal. It was a nice one because it did not feel wet and sticky when you touch it. Note: If you have a reservation, they will sit you when majority of your party have arrived. Came here on a Friday for lunch with some coworkers. The weather was so nice we had to sit outside. I was surprised at how fast the food came out! Not only was it presented nicely but every bite was flavorful and so delicious. We loved everything!\n\nI did not get photos of the inside but it gives definite date night vibes. Dark, sultry and chic. I would cone back for sure.\n\nService was good, we did have to ask for the bill so we could get going otherwise it was fine. Atmosphere is awesome here, definitely stop by if you have a chance Great atmosphere for trendy Mexican food. The only reason I gave the food a three rating was because of cost. It was excellent but pretty expensive and smaller portions. Our party of four ran up a bill of 260.00 with no desserts. They do bring you a complimentary giant cotton candy at the end of your meal though! Pretty cool. Two very small street tacos will run you about 17 beans. So if you're a big eater, you can quickly run out of pesos! Atmosphere was beautiful and service was on point  however so I would recommend for a special occasion! A Night at Lolita Fort Point \u2013 Good Vibes, Great Food, and a DJ That Knows What\u2019s Up \ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udd25\n\nThis past Saturday night, I finally hit up Lolita Fort Point, and let me tell you\u2014this spot is a whole mood. From the second I walked in, the dim lighting, candlelit tables, and lively crowd set the perfect scene. And the DJ? Straight-up \ud83d\udd25. The mix of Latin beats, throwbacks, and just the right amount of bass had me vibing all night. If you can resist dancing in your seat, you might be a robot.\n\nDrinks That Deserve a Round of Applause \ud83c\udf79\ud83d\udc4f\n\nI started with a cocktail that came in a chili-rimmed glass, packed with citrus goodness, and just the right amount of spice. One sip, and I knew I made the right choice. Sweet, tangy, a little fiery\u2014basically, the drink equivalent of a flirty text message. And trust me, the bartenders here do not mess around when it comes to crafting the perfect cocktail.\n\nFood That Made Me Want to Lick the Plate \ud83e\udd24\n\u2022\t\ud83c\udf3d Grilled Street Corn \u2013 Okay, this was a game-changer. Slathered in chipotle aioli, crumbled queso cotija, and a sprinkle of chili lime salt, it was creamy, smoky, and downright addictive. I almost considered ordering another round for \u201cdessert.\u201d\n\u2022\t\ud83e\udd51 Braised Beef Tostadas \u2013 These things were stacked. Crispy tostada base, slow-cooked beef, avocado crema, fresh salsa, and crumbled cheese\u2014every bite was an explosion of flavor. Like, I had to pause mid-chew just to appreciate the masterpiece happening in my mouth.\n\u2022\tOther Tempting Menu Items \u2013 I saw calamari, ceviche, queso dip, and so many other good choices, and honestly? If my stomach had a bigger capacity, I\u2019d have tried them all.\n\nVibes, Service & Overall Experience \ud83c\udf89\n\nLolita isn\u2019t just a restaurant\u2014it\u2019s an experience. Between the dark, intimate ambiance, the friendly staff, and that \ud83d\udd25 DJ keeping the energy high, it felt like the kind of place where you stay for \u201cjust one more round\u201d\u2026 five times.\n\nFinal Verdict: 10/10, Highly Recommend \ud83d\ude4c\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a date night spot, a place to catch up with friends, or just a solid excuse to treat yourself, Lolita Fort Point delivers. And if you go on a Saturday, be prepared\u2014the DJ might just make you want to stay all night. You\u2019ve been warned. \ud83d\ude09 Incredible place for a night out with your girls. \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I loved the interior, it had good music and a dark speakeasy type of vibe. The food is really good, and the street corn \ud83c\udf3d was maybe some of the best I\u2019ve ever had. If you go you must try it!! The cocktails we tried were top tier- elegant flavors and not too sweet. \ud83c\udf78\ud83c\udf79If you go during the weekend I recommend making a reservation, it can get pretty busy."

    "reviews": "When you first enter, this seems like a smaller CVS until you realize there's a second floor. Overall good service but the store does feel a bit messy. I still don't know why they lock up some of their items. Just get better security instead of making the honest people wait around for someone to unlock the shaving cream. I was very sad today to witness a black male being racially profiled by the cashier managing the self check out section, at around 2 pm today. He asked her if they had soap containers, she told him to pay 1st & then she would help him find the soap container, she then accused him of attempting to steal when everyone there could clearly see that he wanted to buy the soap container & everything else he planned to purchase all at once.\n\nWhen the individual walked in the store, he was followed. I could hear the cashier telling the guy, \"I know what you are trying to do\". The guy replied, \" I have no idea what you are talking about\". In the end, he paid for all his items & politely thanked her even though she was extremely rude to him. I've seen this employee smoking cigarettes by the front entrance on multiple occasions so I recognized her. She is a brunette, looks like she is in her 50's, or 60's. This was very sad to watch, I really hope this review will prevent this from happening to other customers in the future. I wish there was a way to give 0 stars. Great CVS! The store itself was standard, but the staff was nice, especially Rita. Welcoming experience and I was able to get what I needed quickly! TERRIBLE customer service upstairs. We went to get passport photos done. There was 2 employees and no customers and despite us asking for help both continued doing what they were doing. Once someone finally stopped to assist us, she couldn\u2019t even tell us the pricing. We walked back out. What a great pharmacy.  I needed a prescription filled pronto and the urgent care was next door.  They were able to process my prescription within 20 minutes and Rubi was super nice The great thing about CVS is, it contains exactly what you expect it will have. CVS is the same generally speaking, anywhere you go. The employees were helpful and it is at a perfect location near the hotel and Seaport district. This is my favorite cvs. Sure, the prices are slightly higher than online and they lock up $6 toothpaste, but the staff is amazing. Every single person that works there is incredibly nice. I've never had to wait more than 30 seconds to unlock a product and they are always offering to help. I arrived at 10:55 p.m. only to find out that both entrances were blocked. I tried to get into any customer was leaving and I was bum-rushed by the staff and they were screaming at me that they were closed I said to them that it's not 11 p.m. yet and the door should not be locked before 11 p.m. but the route Indian Middle Eastern guy was in my face aggressive and very very rude as if I didn't hear him or understanding. I heard and understood very clear both of them The guy ended the girl, however their obnoxiousness was not necessary or called for at this moment when I could have basically got in my drink within 30 seconds in back before they even thought of I even did anything good or bad to their store. It's a legal to have your establishment closed doors before the actual time God forbid I needed an emergency God forbid I needed something to save my life but this was not the customer value store that they claim to be and they really need to replace the entire staff that work here they need new jobs this is nothing type of energy that the seaport deserves. I just want to really appreciate and praise the manager, Kass; I left my $20 cash-back at the self-checkout at 9pm last night and he was right there to handle that oversight as I was already out the door. He took my phone call the next day, confirmed my purchase with the last 4 of my debit card. I picked it up a few hours later and had the pleasure of meeting him. I walk 10 miles a day and will make this CVS a permanent stop on my walks. Thank you so much for hiring the right people. Busy, city vibe- but they have everything a convenient pharmacy should, and the staff were volunteering to help me find things, get in line, and even check me out at the self check out (I somehow messed it up). Best random pharmacy stop of my vacation/travel life, actually. The big, beautiful former bank setting is just so much lipstick on a pig:  this is as ill-managed as any other gritty Walgreens. Pros:  you can walk in the former bank vault.  Cons: everything else.  Went here as Walgreens advertised a good sale and, despite many bad W-experiences, foolishly thought it would be seamless since this is the Boston flagship store.  However, the shelves were picked bare and the manager would not honor the sale price.  Indeed, she claimed the item was not on sale at all, and I had Walgreens actual flyer with the sale price clearly described right in my hand.  She simply disregarded the evidence of her own senses and was very rude.  You never have to shop here as there is a CVS 25' feet away.  CVS's shelf price was actually cheaper and they honored their coupons, sale prices, and corporate advertising.  Walgreens should give up this beautiful central location to a retailer that actually tries to provide value and respects the customer.  Oh, the W. pharmacist was actually very nice:  make her the manager. One of the biggest Walgreens that I have ever been in.  Still couldn't find the cough drops that I was looking for, Breezers with Pectin.  Oh well :( Visited this Walgreens on 02-22-24 and again on the morning of 02-23-24. It is reasonable priced on everything from Boston touristy gear, drinks, phone chargers and medications. Only complaint is staffing. I mean, the pharmacy tech at the door was pleasant however the bloke at the registet was dismissive, unresponsive and rude. Hopefully his day got better, because, if not.... he is in the wrong line of work. It is unfortunate due to the rest of the experience that was more than satisfactory. Got what we went in for and frozen yogurt! It was a bonus, the kids loved it! Some of the staff were rude, but we were visiting from outside the city so maybe that's just city life lol I watched the security guard hit a young girl. Instead of walking away and de escalating he slapped her in the face. When i went in to talk to a worker he said that was only half the story. Regardless of the story i saw that the guard had the opportunity to walk away and that the young girl was not touching him only yelling. They weren\u2019t even inside the Walgreens he could\u2019ve simply gone back inside, instead he reached over someone trying to de escalate the situation and slapped her in the face out of anger. I wasn\u2019t aware that\u2019s how Walgreens did business I went to this seven eleven yesterday after a few months.  I thought I wouldn't come back since I was yelled at and harassed by a customer that appeared to have many problems. I wanted a diet soda from the fountain.  The diet coke was just water and I took a regular ginger ale.  There are diet sodas in bottles but their prices are higher and you get a smaller serving.  I went to the front register, and there was an unpleasant odor.  I asked the person if they would refill the diet coke (I had seen someone refilling it in the past) and he shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.  I was also overcharged for one item.  There is a Massachusetts law that a customer should get a full refund when overcharged.  I didn't mention this to the front worker as I thought he wouldn't do anything about it with his\" I don't care\" attitude. For all the customers who said they have had excellent experiences at this store, I am glad for them.  That has not been the case for me, I will never shop there again.  I realize that my not shopping there won't make a difference in total sales. There are other 7-11 stores that are better. Cashier was rude af, but the shop is always well stocked if you're willing to put up with micro aggressions, likely due to the amount of people begging at the door 24/7, no one wants to enter. This 7-11 is an experience unto itself that should absolutely not be missed. I stopped in on Christmas Eve to buy holiday scratch tickets and some MegaMillions ($1bn jackpot!). Every part of my experience exceeded expectations.\n\nA drunk woman about 20 years my senior was playing the numbers game like she was at Encore and had $65 in winnings after her several dozen tickets had been checked. While we waited she told the group of 3 uncomfortable tourists in front of me about her 103 grandchildren (that she knows of). Absolute perfection.\n\nThe tourists bought their Diet Sodas and scuttled away, and it was my turn to order. Unlike most lottery retailers the staff at 7-11 can't be bothered to organize and label their scratch tickets by cost, so I needed to ask if the giant baubled Xmas tree ticket was $10, after being confused by my question the clerk was able to confirm the price accurately for me.\n\nThere was a second round of confusion when I asked for 10 of them, but when he realized I wasn't joking and confimed it would cost $100, he expertly pulled the roll out of the dispenser, dropped one side of it to the floor and quickly counted out my tickets, then added my MegaMillions and completed the transaction without any fuss.\n\nI honestly can't understand the negative reviews of this location. It is well lit. The staff and other patrons are friendly and helpful. The stock is fresh and easily accessible and I felt totally safe and comfortable throughout my transaction. I will absolutely be patronizing this location again in the future. I\u2019m unsure what the last reviewer meant by this is one of the most realistic locations. Hi unfortunately I did not have a great experience. The store is supposed to open at 7 AM every day and around 7:08 PM I joined three other people who were waiting for it to open. I start at work at 7:30 AM and really wanted to get a five hour energy to help me get through the day. However, the only indication of the store operating was the loud classical music that was being played by speakers on the outside of the building that had been reinforced with security cages. The music is meant to frustrate homeless people who may try to loiter around the store. I am unsure how I feel about this, but I will say it is pretty irresponsible of them to not open on time on the first work day of 2022. Especially, being in downtown Boston they should realize the number of customers that they lose by being late. This place is not open 24/7.  I went to this location around 5am and there was a guy inside just sitting on the side claiming the cashier was downstairs occupied. First of all why do you have a random person supervising your store if they do not work there? I honestly don\u2019t know how this location is even open still. They need to stick to regular business hours.  Don\u2019t ever waste your time and come here after hours. Ara Jewelers is AMAZING! This is the best jewelry store in Boston hands down! They can make you anything and are always willing to accommodate. Whether it be an engagement ring wedding band necklace or bracelet they can make you whatever you want! Their work is second to none!! They made me the perfect engagement ring for my gf! She is going to LOVE IT!! Definitely go see them if you\u2019re in the area. You won\u2019t be disappointed!! I went for my engagement ring and it was the best and easiest experience I\u2019ve had. The nicest people who made the experience that much better and my fiancee absolutely loves everything about her ring! I highly recommend!! Wow , unbelievable Beautiful work !!!\nArc Jeweler Family!\nThree generation , working hard together to deliver the highest quality work in the jewelry District.\nHeart of downtown Boston, Massachusetts .\nHighly recommended\nThis is the jeweler place to go ,\nLook for the ARC \u2026.no doubt. I was referred to Vicken at Ara by a friend of mine who got his wife\u2019s engagement ring there. I had some ideas on what my girlfriend wanted but had no clue about what everything meant. Vicken made it easy to understand and the experience I got from them was exceptional. The ring came out absolutely gorgeous as well. Overall exceptional experience and would definitely recommend! When I started the process of looking for an engagement ring, I checked out a few jewelry stores and wasn\u2019t getting the experience I was looking for, but was unsure of exactly what I wanted and then I was introduced to Viken and he showed me everything I needed to know. I gave him my budget and exactly what I was looking for and we made a ring together in no time. It was a great experience. I would definitely recommend checking them out. Abysmal customer service. Went in to buy Birkenstocks (clogs, 2 sandals) and the salesperson treated me like I was a beggar. Ended up buying them at Nordstrom instead. I went to buy a pair of Adidas Highlighter walking sneakers I had been eyeballing for 2 weeks\nI walked in and the young lady Who finalized my sale saw I was wanting to try others but I wanted those and she was so nice & humorous\nI recommend this store for special fits styles or leather shoes. I have purchased from them over the years. They are awesome. Small selection but they had some decent sale prices.  The staff were nice and very quick to get sizes for me So happy to know the sneakers \ud83d\udc5f I got was still there. Happy that foot paths specialized in my size which is 9.5 and their should be more store that follow their lead. I'm happy with their store and will tell friends and families and advertise on my page the great style, color and price so they can run down to get some great sneakers like I did or other products.  My friend got me a nice black cap with neon yellow spikes in them happy they got for me. I had a pleasurable and easy experience while purchasing a pair of shoes for work. Store was relatively empty and they had my size in stock. The return process however, has been the exact opposite. The website shows hours open on Saturday until 9pm. I show up at 6:50pm and the door is locked and lights are off, but there are 2 workers standing at the cash register. I call and basically get told the website hours are wrong and they always close at 7pm but that night there was \u201can emergency\u201d and they needed to close early. I was quite disappointed and reached out on the website contact page to voice my frustrations. If I had known the store closed at 7, I would have gone earlier. Also it did not seem like there was an emergency as the worker had time to answer my call in the same amount of time a simple return would take. I check the hours for during the week and planned to stop by this morning before working. The website said open at 9:30am. I arrive at 10:15am or so today and the door is once again  locked.  I call the store asking what time they open and am told between 10:30-11am because of technical difficulties. I work 10:30am-7pm and I voice my frustrations as I have now have gone out of my way and tried to return shoes twice. I was told that if I went this upcoming Saturday between 10:30am and 7pm that the store would be open and if I was over the 21 day return mark, that as long as the shoes were unworn (which they are) and that I had the receipt (which I do), they would make an exception. It is unacceptable and unprofessional to not have updated and accurate store hours on the website or at least posted on the door. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t work from home so I have to rely on the store hours to try and get somewhere around my job schedule. The worker on the phone this morning was nicer and more understanding than the female I spoke to on Saturday but I am still quite frustrated.  I plan on making a final trip to the store, returning the shoes this upcoming Saturday, and will then not be shopping from this store again. One credit for Sam Situ (supv or manager?), very nice manager and knowledgeable. One credit for the nice bank environment.\nI remembered people were used to work here very nice and friendly. However, the two tellers at the counter were horrible! Very bad attitudes and no patient! One young lady teller THREW back my ID, some docs, other cards to the window instead of giving me back nicely. She didn\u2019t know what she was doing, Sam was there helping her. I guess she was still in training which is fine, but her attitudes were so bad! We are customers! Not people you should be rude for! Not recommended if you do speak English\u2026 I believe even other bank in Chinatown they will provide translation for you if needed? Only used their ATM during business hours. Love the fact they don't charge any fees when you use a UnionPay debit card. I understand the reason why they shut the ATM room outside of business hours, however, this could be perfectly solved if the door of the ATM room actually works as it supposed to. So you need a debit card to get in there, thus no homeless would be in. 24-hr is standard and needed. Please consider have the ATM room door upgraded or fixed. Good service. Great people Good direction Billie n the guys at Boston Precious are professional and work within your budget,  great selection of jewelry items to choose from, I'll be back for sure The people were so nice and the jewelry was affordable and in pristine condition, highly recommend this place! THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF I SPENT JAY LENNO# get if you knew how much value gold holds you wouldn\u2019t say that I spent thousands with my guy he always good too me Maybe it\u2019s you to broke to shop their stop posting nonsense This is where i got my 2 solid 14k chains would recommend friendly staff and i got a really good deal for my budget The best jewelry in Boston Massachusetts This review is purely for the avocado oil, sorta. I get there are reviews saying if you don\u2019t want to pay the (extremely) high prices comparatively to other stores in East Boston, then don\u2019t come here, which is true. But it\u2019s wild that the avocado oil - and canola I think, I forget what the other option was - was 3x more expensive than what would be elsewhere. I\u2019m putting this review here to let people know before going, as I was not aware of the incredibly high prices before stopping in on my way home.\n\nAgain, if you don\u2019t care about paying more, then this spot actually has a lot more items and selection offered than what I expected. Plus the location is great, 30 second walk from the Maverick stop.\n\nHowever, I will not be buying my cooking oil here. And that\u2019s okay. To each their own. In case anyone was curious their premade take away food is surprisingly delicious! I picked up their rosemary lemon chicken yesterday so i can have it for lunch. Their snack food selection is vast and they\u2019re so nice! Great environment. Amazing staff.  Healthy, organic food. Wonderful choice of wines.\nP.S. very clean and comfy restrooms\nDefinitely will come back again. My first experiences have been great! Really nice people working here, also there\u2019s a huge variety of grocery options that are reasonably priced for the convenience. Every type of alcohol, frozen entrees, and fresh produce. Can\u2019t wait to try the new deli! Boars head sandwiches, good selection of craft beer, and reasonable priced meals, chicken rice and vegetables.  Decent nitro cold brew too. Visited today and was taken aback by the incredibly rude staff. Avoid at all costs.\n\nJust looked at the reviews and looks like lots of people have experienced this and the company just responds with the following but nothing changes: We're truly sorry to hear about your experience at our Boston store. Your feedback is important to us and we take it seriously. We strive to provide excellent customer service and it's clear we fell short in this instance. We'll certainly consider your comments as we work to improve our in-store experience. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. shout out to Syzy for being so very helpful with let me know about the discounts I was able to get for my new work shoes !! she is a wallet saver and life saver gawd bless this angel !! Unbelievably bad customer service today in the Sketchers store on Washington street in Boston.\nThe two employees were more interested in their phones and interacting with each other than attending to the customers.\nWe stood looking at them waiting for them to notice that we were looking for help, we waited and waited eventually they looked down our direction near the door so I put my hand up to beckon either of the staff to come help and the young girl approached.\nThere was no apology for not noticing that help was required there was no small talk at all in fact interaction on the young girls behalf was zero.\nI also noticed another couple in the shop having the same issue when attempting to get help.\nI would suggest that the management review the staff training as it could not possibly included a customer focus section.\nDue to the inability of the employees to demonstrate any customer value I left the store without making a purchase. My sister was greeted by a lady (Celia) who asked her what size she wanted. My sister said, \"Siete\". The lady told her you need to speak and learn English. She gave my sister a piece of paper and told her to write the number. Next to the lady, there was another staff member (not helping another customer) who spoke Spanish and was willing to help my sister. The lady said \"no\" and that my sister should write the number. My sister did as she was told, although she was confused and didn't know what was happening.\n\nUpon returning with the sneakers, the staff member, in a loud and presumptuous manner, announced the price of each pair. This assumption about my sister's financial status was not only unwarranted but also a clear indication of the staff's lack of customer service skills.\n\nWhen my sister returned to the front desk to request a different size for one of the pairs, the staff member's reaction was equally insensitive. She returned, once again in a loud and accusatory tone, questioning my sister's choice of size. This further illustrated the staff's lack of understanding and empathy. The lady did not apologize for her terrible customer service.\n\nThis experience was horrible and I am sharing this because I want this to be addressed to prevent similar situations. Staff need to be properly trained. The other staff who were present (not helping customers) ignored the situation.  While in the store, I noticed that most of the customers were Spanish-speaking. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. It was an interesting experience. When I was checking out, the clerk asked me to give him the other two pairs of shoes that I tried but didn't buy. I was already checking out but had to go back to pick up those shoes. There were other clerks standing and taking a break in the store. Such a semi-self-service shopping Lol Just picked up online order. The white woman with glasses at register who gave me my order was soooo rude. She didn\u2019t say even thank you to me. Maybe racist because I\u2019m a minor race. Be careful people I was travelling to Ottawa got all my family gifts from here. Cheaper price comparing with same store in Canada in addition to 70% off on most of the items. I spent 280$ for gifts for 3 kids and 1 adult including winter and summer clothes  the materials r perfect. I don't know when they cleaned this Store the last time, but it was the most filhy place I've ever been to. Only two examples and the whole Store floor looks like that. Good prices. Very small space. I was kept waiting in line while staff ignored me.\nWhen I managed retail I knew how to upsell to customers until they were ready to leave, then get them out in a timely manner. NOT HERE. Good place to browse, their inventory can be hit or miss because a lot of the stuff that hits the factory store has something weird about the way the garment was cut or measured. Still, you can find a good bargain, and nice stuff sometimes! It's smaller than you might expect inside. I find there is often a long wait for a dressing room. I scheduled an appointment to withdraw a mature CD on September 25th, and the representative told me that my CD wouldn\u2019t mature until September 30th. I thought I had misread the email stating that I must withdraw it before September 30th, so I left. Now, I\u2019ve just realized that he was wrong! Since I missed the September 30th deadline, the CD will now mature on November 30th.\n\nThe strange part is that I\u2019ve received calls saying I didn\u2019t show up for the appointment. Then who was the guy who took my driver\u2019s license and debit card? Is my information still safe? This is so creepy, and I\u2019m so confused. I searched for the person I was supposed to have the appointment with, and LinkedIn shows he is Hispanic, but the guy who confirmed my name and spoke to me was Black. They are definitely not the same person!\n\nThis must be the worst Chase Bank in Boston! I\u2019m genuinely concerned about my personal information now. They don\u2019t allow clients to access the atm during the weekend; no signage of a broken door, nothing. Huge disgrace to the company and will be calling corporate the next business day. I met with Daniel Samudio here for a couple of services. He was very patient, respectful and knowledgeable. For the areas where he wasn't an expert he pulled out info from other sources and got us exactly what we needed. He even stayed late to ensure I'm all set and he did that with a smile. Thank you for your proactiveness and customer obsession, Daniel. It sounds like the branch staff are great! But, I give Chase Bank an F for profound corporate irresponsibility.  Chase is the largest financer of fossil fuel projects in the world, funding climate disruption and disaster which has already cost much human suffering and many lives.  Chase could use its enormous financial leverage instead to facilitate a rapid transition to a post-carbon economy powered by safe, clean, renewable energy.   That would be worth an A. The good: Staff here are really friendly.\n\nThe bad: They have made a mistake every single time I've been in -- from little things like calling me \"sir\" (I'm a woman who does not look like a man at all) to bigger things like mailing my new debit card to the wrong address and depositing a check for the wrong amount. They always fix the problems in the end, but they are MAJOR inconveniences. They consistently seem confused, and different staff members provide very different answers to the same question. I've never had problems with Chase before, so it might just be that the staff at this branch are not well-trained. Extremely overpriced and they do not give receipts, which tends to mean that they will take every opportunity to overcharge you. I was mugged trying to get into this atm by two African Americans. Permanently closed This location is permanently closed The food was good and I think everything on the menu is fresh and vegan. I had the Crispy Chicken 'Tender' Sandwich and fries and the Cowboy Cookie. I tried some falafel and that was good too. Great food and drink options for vegans! The staff are super friendly and welcoming. They were able to talk us through all the options and recommendations. You get a generously sized and tasty meal. Highly recommended for fast and quality food. I used doordash service\nI was very disappointed with the fact that deliver food was not properly secured. My drink had open lid no seal over the mouth to protect me from the delivery person. Food bag wasn't stapled or taped closed. Food completely exposed!!!\nYou have a responsibility to cover the food properly, treat unseen customers as you would want to be treated! The only thing I was safe to enjoy was the hummus it really was delicious. The oyster mushroom sandwich was dry and lack flavor maybe extra tomatoes would have made the sandwich a success story.\nI'm jus a vegan trucker who doesn't get to the area often so my review don't quite matter, I like expressing myself tho\ud83d\ude01 Had the chickpea fritter and the Mediterranean bowl with plant based chicken tenders. Both items were really good and I would highly recommend this place to vegetarians. The food at the clover food lab was extremely rich in flavor! We really enjoyed all of the vegan options as well as the fun drinks.\n\nThe sharan was a delicious indochinese cauliflower sandwich. The rosemary fries and tostones with chipotle aioli were extremely tasty! The restaurant is excellent, offering a pleasant ambiance. The waitstaff was attentive, polite, and professional. Our dining experience was delightful, savoring dishes such as the honey-glazed salmon, duck, cauliflower popcorn, and blue tapas - all of which were delicious. I look forward to revisiting this spot when I return to Boston. Great location and great views. Given the price of the food, it was a little underwhelming, not gonna lie. The service can definitely be better too as our waiter had forgotten that we\u2019d ordered a coffee and brought it long after we\u2019d finished our meal. I\u2019ll maybe give it another chance later for the 5 stars. First time eating here prior to attending a show in the Theater District.\nWe were seated quickly and overall service was very good.  The atmosphere is fairly dark with very nice views of Avery and Washington Streets.\nWe started with the Tapas Appetizer and I would say it stole the show. I forgot to grab a photo but I would highly recommend you try it.\nThe main courses were very good, but nothing stands out like the Tapas.\nWe finished with the Chocolate Mousse Cake and it was a nice way to end the evening. Four of us thoroughly enjoyed our dinners at Blu the other night. The service was well timed and friendly. The focaccia bread was a tasty start to our delicious meals, which were flavorful with just the right amount of spice and presentation. The view from our table was delightful. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience. It was ok experience. Location is great and view from the window is great if you are seated in the right place. Friendly service. Food was ok. Fried Calmari appetizer was below average. Salmon was great but pasta had too much tomato sauce on it. We ordered cosmo and some pear cocktail. Bartender seemed to dump vodka on both and forgot how to make cosmo. For that service charge could have been better food at least This place is a 10/10.  We were in Boston for 5 days over St Patrick's day and we first stopped at Beantown after our flight.  Immediately, we were greeted with amazing food and a great staff.  Over the next few days, we found ourselves returning to Beantown for the incredible food, welcoming staff, and the rugby games.  We tried everything from the lobster roll, burgers, wraps, hotdogs, and wings.  Everything was so good.  Everything you'd want on your first trip to Boston.  Beantown can easily be a one stop shop for the best wings, lobster roll, and wraps in town.\n\nI highly recommend this pub.  It truly made our trip special and allowed us to introduce our Irish friend to the best first experience in America.\n\nSpecial thanks to Sharon who was so generous and hospitable to us.  We felt like regulars after only a day.  Our wait staff and bartenders were incredible as well.  Matt, Michael, Bailey, and Kathryn made this place extra special during our stay. Busy place on a Friday night but we had great food! I had the lobster grilled cheese on rye with a side of Boston baked beans. My wife had the lobster roll. Both were fantastic and I only wish we could have tried other menu items as well. Ryan Meetup was here and an overall EPIC experience. The bar was perfect, cold beers in everyone\u2019s hands. Buffalo wings were A+. All the Ryan\u2019s just being Ryan\u2019s , having the best time a Ryan could have. No better place to be with my fellow Ryan\u2019s. Would Ryan here again. Even though Beantown Pub gets a ton of tourists, this is also an excellent bar for locals. My wife & I are regulars and consider most of the staff as family! The atmosphere is lively and friendly. The people here are the best in Boston! The food is typical pub fare; however, I've never had a bad meal. My favorite is the turkey club on rye, which is big enough for two people. Touchtunes provides the music, so if you have the app, you can listen to your favorite music all night! I can't say enough about the staff, especially BRIGID, Megan, Matt, Ben, Emily, Sabrina, Eve, Syd, Nancy, Kyra, Elana, Maeve, Dave, Hugo, Alex, Mary, Freddy, and SHARRON! Weekend nights can get busy, especially after 6:00 PM. Weeknights can be busy after 5:00 PM. Whether you're visiting our city or live here, I highly recommend the Beantown Pub! I didn\u2019t like how the food was WAY to expensive. I was with a party of four and if was 81.48 bucks!\ud83d\ude33 Three people got drinks and we got two appetizers! My friend got an espresso martini and they messed up her drink twice! \ud83c\udf7b\ud83c\udf7a\ud83c\udf78 She was nice so she didn\u2019t tell them the last time. She didn\u2019t get the drink she ordered. I got mozzerella sticks that were 13.99! \ud83d\ude33 the most expensive thing we got was 17.99. Which was a spiked coffee. I do not recommend this place for food or special alcohol drinks. The messed up drink my friend got was so spicy that my mom took one drink and is still burping! \ud83d\ude02 Food is normal but the employee is not well instructed how to accept orders i had an voucher and it was reacted without any reason and then the employee went to the kitchen and didnt took my order anymore Order for happy meal specifically for the seasonal toy but they give other old ones without notice. Waited super long. Has destroyed my day. Bad service, don\u2019t come. I just stood in line for 10 minutes and I did not even make eye contact with an employee.  I saw one back there but absolutely nobody acknowledged that there was a line at the register for 10 minutes.  I can't use the kiosks because I am visually impaired and with the LED color screens it looks like scrambled eggs to my eyes.  And I pay in cash.  I have to use the register.  I don't know how somebody is comfortable running a McDonald's where somebody can't order at the register.  I remember when companies cared about customer service I\u2019m a regular customer at McDonald\u2019s, and today I placed a pickup order at this branch. Unfortunately, my order was incomplete. I only received the burger, nuggets, and drink but my fries were missing. I understand it may have been during a busy hour, but I feel that staff should double-check the order more carefully. I acknowledge that I should have checked the bag myself before leaving as well. I\u2019m not asking for a refund as it\u2019s only a few dollars, but I just hope this will not happen frequently in the future. Place is filthy, littered with vagrants. Well beyond capacity at most times. Staff are rude the food is cold and they have had no upstairs dining FOR YEARS I had to eat on the floor last time. No joke, none of the power outlets work. A mickey D's at the heart of Boston can do WAY better Five star on all aspects! In fact, it\u2019s the only Chinese restaurant in Boston I have been that has good vibes, has delicious food, and is affordable! Very good value for money. Peking duck is a must try, though I\u2019d recommend half duck if you have four people or fewer so that you can try more dishes. Always be ready to wait in a long line to get a seated, though you can reserve a table if you have more than four people in the party. Enjoy! The restaurant was very busy on Saturday, so we came back the next day. It was still quite busy, but we didn\u2019t have to wait. We ordered the Peking duck and mapo tofu\u2014both were solid. The whole Peking duck was on the pricier side ($90), while the mapo tofu was reasonably priced ($20). The atmosphere wasn\u2019t fancy, but it also didn\u2019t feel cheap. We enjoyed the food and will visit to try other dishes again. Best authentic Chinese cuisine I've tasted. Dined with a large group so there was considerable plate-sharing - from deep fried prawns in salty egg yolk to the bullfrog hot pot and everything in between. Absolutely delicious. Highly recommended. The Peking duck here is the first thing on the menu, however it\u2019s very greasy, not very crispy and not juicing. It lacks flavor. Do not get the duck here, it\u2019s not authentic and is a waste of money. Unfortunately I also mentioned that someone in our party has a food sensitivity and the kitchen still put that ingredient into our food, but we couldn\u2019t see it and that person ate it before they came back and informed us the kitchen made a mistake. They did comp the item and remake it however if the person has been allergic that could be an ER visit.Also the salted egg yolk shrimp isn\u2019t good ether, worst one I\u2019ve had. Having said that everything else was good, and most of the meal was good. Certainly hit or miss. Here\u201dwhat was yummy. Wontons in chili oil, honey walnut shrimp, pork belly with black tea sauces, pea shoots, and the mango pomelo sago. The coconut desert was also good. I googled \"best Peking duck in Boston\" and this showed up and it's not wrong. The moment we walked in, we were warmly greeted. The entire ambience is so posh that you'll feel relaxed in there. We had the tea which was soothing and very nicely presented in clay mugs and a serving pot. Coming to the duck, it was the most deliciously cooked and we enjoyed it very much. We took the half duck and that was enough for two people. The cost is roughly $23/ person before taxes and tips, which is not at all bad given the atmosphere here. Would be back again. In fact, the workers at Burger King treat customers with respect, including the manager, and it is clean. As for the whole order...very hot and fresh. Amazing service! Francesca was very nice and considerate toe m and my boyfriend while we were on a time crunch. Great worker and pretty smile!! THANK YOU FRANCESCA!!!  I'm highly disappointed in this store. Management isn't completely terrible  but lacks customer integrity and service focus. I ordered a burger with no bacon but received a bacon burger. I came in to exchange it and the gentlemen at the counter completely ignored me. Very rude and dismissive. At which point a woman who I believe I spoke to the GM and she apologized and tried to help the situation. In accepting her efforts...\n\nI order a another sandwich for my friend and she found these tomatoes in her sandwich. I'm mortified! The quality of those tomatoes are insanely bad if not rotten. What person just puts end piece tomatoes in a sandwich... Unless not spitefully intentional. I just don't get it. One can't be that naive. I won't ever come back here again. The manger apologized and gave me my money back. Which should be mandatory. But I'm not satisfied. The only good service I received was the young lady taking orders and the other sweeping. Other than that this place is a disappointment. Phenomenal! I haven\u2019t been to BK for a while. Thanks to TMobile app. for the FREE whopper.\n\nOverall, this store is amazing. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. I\u2019ll definitely come again and eat here! Highly recommended BK place to eat. Servers were friendly and nice but the place is just a mess especially the bathroom. It needs cleaning and water is not running. You can get the passcode from the cashier. Limited table seating. No parking and no high chairs available Went to LaGrassa\u2019s for the first time in a while.\nNice comfy place & friendly staff who explained the food ingredients.\nI got the pastrami/ corned beef sub roll.\nReally good sub\u2026.. meat was perfectly prepared with a really delicious seeded roll.\n\nThe only problem was the price.\nA $40 lunch isn\u2019t for most people. I found the price steep, and not worth the value for product.\nVery good sub lunch\u2026.. Yes\n$40 lunch \u2026\u2026 too pricy\nI\u2019m apparently in the minority here\u2026.\nThe place was packed\u2026.there was a constant flow of patrons and food delivery drivers\u2026.\n\nBuyer beware\u2026. Pricy but delicious\nExpect to pay a lot for a tasty sub The BEST pastrami sandwich I've ever eaten in my entire life. This is a MUST TRY if you're near Boston commons. \ud83e\udd6a\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd0d\n\nThe chitpole pastrami sandwich was really good but their other pastrami sandwiches are probably good as well. While eating at a restaurant across the street from this one, my partner noticed the sign and thought we should check it out (he loves subs and deli sandwiches) so when we returned to our hotel for the day, he checked out the place on Google. Food looked amazing so we stopped by for lunch.\n\nWe were quite literally blown away by how good this food was. You get great food for the price too, my partner's sandwich was pleasantly packed with meat and toppings and my BBQ pastrami sandwich was delicious. The best pastrami I've ever had. Juicy, flavorful, and melt in your mouth tender. 10/10 would most definitely return on another trip to Boston. Listen.  People always say \u201cthis is the best\u2026 I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d  This is one of the few times I say it and it\u2019s substantiated. The Pastrami Corned Beef Combo is the BEST sandwich I\u2019ve ever had. So juicy and falls apart in your mouth. I visit Boston a couple times and year and stopping at Sam Lagrossas is a requirement. I love trying new food when in the city but this is a no brainer. Check hours! They close early afternoon! I even have the tshirt! Great sandwiches, friendly servers, and a cool environment! Delicious sandwiches, we loved them all! Especially the Pastrami & Corned Beef Combo! The lemonade was really good too! The sandwiches are pretty expensive but they are big enough to split. We ordered togo and ate in a green space near Harvard! Great option to take to one of the many beautiful spaces in Boston and have a relaxing picnic! If you are looking for one-of-a-kind dining in the midst of Boston, Sip Wine Bar & Kitchen at 581 Washington Street is not to be missed. It's a great combination of comfort and elegance, ideal for either a snug dinner and evening in or evening out with pals.\n\nFrom the moment you enter, the modern and welcoming atmosphere invites you to sit back and unwind. The elegant d\u00e9cor and warm lighting create a tone for a night to remember. Ambiance indoors was pretty lacking, I recommend sitting outside or else not coming here. Wine glasses were dirty (can\u2019t tell from the picture but both glasses were). Food was ok, but not worth a meal if you\u2019re a visiting tourist and have limited meals. This place is in a great location with both indoor and outdoor seating. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. Service was decent, I got a glass of the Malbec and it was good and I got the Hanger steak as an entree. I found the portion to be a bit small for the price but it was good. Great sav blanc here and tuna. Come here before you go to the theater. Great service too! I came her with a friend prior to seeing a show at the Boston Opera House. It is conveniently located next to the Opera House. We sat outside which was superb! There is no parking for this place, unless you use a street or nearby parking garage.\nThe salad was delicious. The salmon wasn't overcooked. The food all looked and tasted fresh. Desserts was interesting. One was legit 4 marshmallows on sticks with dipping sauces, a fancy and expensive twist on something so simple. Why, can't I ever think of these things?! Service was prompt and courteous. A bottle of wine, 2 entrees and 2 desserts came out to be about $135. We went there as part of an experience for a picnic to pick up some hummus they had ready for us  but the weather was less than ideal to go for a picnic so we got a table and ate lunch there.\n\nThe wait for a table was less than 10 minutes for a party of 2.\n\nWe ended up ordering brunch items because they serve brunch until 3pm.\n\nThe food is a bit pricey than a fast service lunch place but the food is great and our server was very friendly.\n\nI would definitely go back there. We went here around 5pm and there was almost no one there. We first ordered the hummus dip appetizer which we both didn\u2019t like. The pita chips were stale and could have way more seasoning and I wish they used red pepper hummus instead of traditional. The carrots and onions were good though. I then ordered the chickpea burger with fries and a side of chipotle mayo. The patty was mushy and dry that I had to keep dipping it in the mayo so I wish I got the turkey or beef one instead. The fries were good but they were more like potato wedges than fries. Service was not great, the waitress was not that friendly and when we asked her what something was on the menu she said \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Overall, the food we got was mediocre but maybe they have better options. Wish the service was better. Amazing food and courteous staff full of smiles. Was walking down the road and saw the place completely full ( a good sign). Loved their Mexicali burger which was recommended by them in Burgers. Stumbled upon Back Deck after unsuccessfully getting a table at a few restaurants in the area. Ari provided great service and the food was good. I had a pleasant experience. Will come back again next time I visit Boston. Definitely make reservations. They have room at the bar but not very many seats for drop ins. Their food was good but surprised me. We got chicken strips and they were not breaded but grilled. They were good, just not what we expected. But their drinks!!! Delicious! Stopped by for a post-show drink. Closes at 10 pm on Friday evening.I overheard a few patrons complaining the 10 pm closing. Kitchen closes earlier. I caught the last call. It was not crowded. Nice, large and airy room. Great for large groups. Friendly service.Good beer choices and non alcoholic drinks. The IPA I tried was too sweet for me though. Prices are on par with the nearby places.Not sure how good the food is but good place to stop for a beer with friends. We came here for lunch before seeing Funny Girl at the Opera House. We have dined here before so knew we would be satisfied. The staff is super friendly and offer great recommendations. It is an interesting space that got louder and as it became more crowded. The menu has changed a bit and offers international fare, which I was honestly a bit dubious about trying. I am glad we tried the newer dishes, however. The Butter Chicken was tender and flavorful. I would have preferred it with rice rather than nan, but it made a satisfactory lunch. The Sp\u00e4tzle Mac n Cheese was delicious if a bit hot seasoning-wise. There should be a note on the menu as it was almost too hot for my daughter.  The Arepa Peluga was good but our third favorite of the three. Note, the restrooms are in the basement. Nice brewery if you\u2019re in the area shopping or taking a stroll in the park.  Big space and bar counter, offering about 8-10 beers.  Tried 3 and all were decent\u2014-would probably lean towards their IPA\u2019s which had the most flavor.  Prices are about $9-10 a pour.  They offer  food menu but I didn\u2019t try any.  Service was friendly and prompt. Gorgeous historic building. Great smooth beers. Variety of options. Friendly staff who are very knowledgeable. Enjoyed some tasters and picked our favorite pint to share. Bartender was super chill and provided some spots to check out on the rainy day. We were walking the freedom trail, and it led us to Democracy! A great place to end our day. Really cool spot. We had the Apricot Blonde....it was very nice and refreshing. Lucy was the best!...very personable and fun to talk to. Go check it out! Melissa at the hostess desk is the BEST. We called last min for a reservation for brunch day of Nutcracker and they couldn\u2019t accommodate. She called us back and said she could fit us at the time we needed, separating the tables in 4 and 2. When we arrived she sat us all together. Food and service was great, Noelle was our server. Walk right around the corner to Boston Opera House. Beautiful decor and so festive! Thanks! The service and the food 10/10 would absolutely recommend. You don't have to be a guest of the hotel to dine here either. The attention to detail by the staff is some of the best I have ever seen. I cannot wait to return! Stopped by the Artisan Bistro for some takeout to the room. I had an amazing experience both at the bar area while waiting for the food and with the taste and quality of the meals brought back as well. We couldn't recommend this establishment highly enough. Both the food and service were welcoming and fantastic, and the pastries were out of this world! I'm a Boston local, and I have visited the Artisan Bistro on Christmas Eve the past 4 years! Great food and service! Keep up the great work! \ud83d\udc4d PS They have a great wine list! \ud83c\udf77 Sandra, was our server. She was exceptional, delivering an outstanding level of service that made the meal truly enjoyable. She greeted every guest with a warm smile and made sure all needs were met quickly and efficiently. Their knowledge of the menu was impressive, offering great recommendations and accommodating any special requests with ease. What really stood out was their ability to create a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, turning a simple breakfast into a memorable part of the day. Their professionalism and genuine care for us made the experience feel special and effortless. Good food at great prices! The vegetarian selection is wonderful; we got the falafel wrap and the eggplant panini, and both were incredible. Convenient place to grab a quick bite on the go, or sit and relax. Great spot for a quick lunch! The line looks long but moves quick. The chicken Caesar wrap is awesome and packed full of ingredients. Friendly service and reasonable prices. Good variety of sandwiches. Service was quick. Food was delicious.\nWe ordered Collette\u2019s Omelet with spinach, mushrooms and cheese. Portions were generous.\nTables were wobbly.\nRestaurant was not especially busy or crowded. Best deal in Boston!! Salmon dinner 13 bucks .... oh, and the quiche is to die for!!! (and salad $9!!!) Would pay much more to be honest! Average pizza\nSeemed most of the people visiting were getting to go, I eat at the restaurant which it's okay\nPrice it's fair Ordered from here and I immediately regretted it, waste of money! From the food to the staff,  absolutely awful.( check out the loaded hash browns I got) just go down the street for a better experience. Had iced coffee.\n\nAll types of coffee and toppings/sweeteners/milk available.\nCoffee/drinks come in size of choice including small, medium , large.\nDrinks also include chocolate, frozen shakes and more.\n\nSnacks include donuts (of all types), breads and bagels (various fillings) and more.\n\nPickup service/option available.\nOrder in shop happens from inside shop kiosk.\n\nLocation is next to Boston common park.\n\nGiving it 4 stars because shop could be cleaner and service better. This is one of the worst Dunkin's I've been to in Boston. The people are nice but they have no idea what they're doing. They always make my coffee wrong and sometimes it's half filled. I will probably go to another location which is a bummer because this location was so convenient but just not worth it. There is no cashier at this location, you have to order via kiosks, the one that I used had no option for cash, while the other did. When this location first came to be, the public was told \" same number of employees, but no cashiers, so faster service.\" That didn't happen with my visit 2 employees, but at other locations I've seen 4 to 5. Finally, the main entrance has 3 setps, but they seem to have a wheelchair/ accessible entrance. However it's being used as storage, or I could simply be wrong and think entrance is used for deliveries. The gimmick of no cashiers is nice, since I have bad vision and can't see the menu, so I like the kiosks, but the wait time for my order, when we were told it's going to be quicker, without the standard register is wrong. Food was fine, nothing wrong there. Good: I ordered a medium brown sugar lemonade and it was delicious.\n\nNot so Good: It's a crowded place so you need to take your order and go to another places. Nevertheless, there is a beautiful and huge park next to Dunkin donuts and in front of the government Palace The location is extremely busy 24/7. It took a long time just to get my food which was fine BUT. They forgot my drink so I had to wait for them to get me one. I finished my whole meal and still had to 15+min just for a drink!!(NOT THE ATMOSPHERE FOR KIDS) ** 329 Washington St, Boston, MA 02108 **\n\nMy order was a cheeseburger plain (that is, bread, meat and cheese) and I paid 0.10 for the paper bag (which I already think is absurd, but I never hesitated).\nThe guy who was doing EXPO (serving the lunch) gave me a burger with bread + meat and placed my order on the table, without the paper bag...\nI complained to him that the sandwich came without cheese. He rudely countered by informing me that I ordered \"plain\".\nI said: That's right! Bread, meat and cheese. Because if I wanted bread and meat, I would have paid cheaper and ordered a hamburger...\nHe rolled his eyes and came back with a raw cheese in his hand and gave it to me!\nLack of respect for the customer and empathy for human beings... Avoid at all cost. Staff are really lazy and rude. As soon as you are not looking they start to gossip about you and the  rest of the customers. Specially the guy with the make up. He is bad news. I somehow accidentally ordered on the computer the regular big breakfast (without hotcakes) when I wanted the one with the  hotcakes ($1 more). They would not work with me and made me pay another $6 for hotcakes.  Would not return. Very nice McDonalds and food was prepared really fast but the burgers were a bit oily Went for a birthday dinner for restaurant week in March. Therefore, we were on a fixed menu. Service was a bit low despite the restaurant being a bit empty but our server was great and energetic once he got to us.\nThe appetizers with the escargot and the beef were to die for. They appear to have gone for the cheaper items for the main menu. The duck dish was tasteless but the silver lining is the how accommodating the restaurant was. Upon mentioning the duck dish, they quickly offered to switch it out for another main course item of my preference. the salmon they brought in was very good. flavourful and crispy on one side. The Sunday gravy was quite good as well.\nI made the mistake of ordering a cheese board with a chocolate truffle for dessert. Tasty, filling but a bit pricey Thought to be French, turned out to be American Italian. Food not bad. The olive oil for bread is good, but balsamic vinegar is not provided. Recommend Henry's soup and Wellington steak.  Upper floor is good for dining, lower floor is more like a pub. Can reach the entrance from either side of the small lane. Went during Restaurant Week.  Thought it would be a great opportunity to try out the food.  Capaccio and risotto were very good.  Ravioli was gummy.  Wellington had extremely salty bites and yet the meat was under-seasoned.  Dessert and drinks ordered were nothing to write home about.  Appreciated the wait service and clean plating.  Maybe will think about giving the place a second chance, outside of restaurant week. If you love oysters, clams and shrimps you are going to have an amazing happy hour there, because all of these stuff that I listed above would cost you only one dollar a peace. Our server was knowledgeable and pleasant and with a couple beers we had a great time. Great pre theater place just off the path but close to everything. Great table with a view upstairs. Risotto was delicious - I enjoyed the Wellington but not the home run I was looking for as not enough pasty crust or pate  for my taste. Great service too... Probably the worst Dunkin\u2019s I\u2019ve been to. The previous time I was here the cashier was rude and distracted by his phone for minutes before I finally asked if I could order. Came back to this location only because of the convince of it being the closest one to The Common. This time the lady was rude and actually told a person in my party to flip there phone over for the barcode. Really. I\u2019ve been to Dunkin\u2019s many times and that\u2019s the first I heard that. They also had the dining room closed off probably because they don\u2019t feel like cleaning it. It also smells in there. By far the worst Dunkin\u2019s. The coffee was mediocre but the donut was good. The line fluctuates in size often. Luckily when I was at Dunkin' there was no wait. However, a minute later the line was almost out of the front door. Service was quick and efficient, food was great, and there was a counter to stand and eat food. While writing this review on July 21st, 2023, there are NO RESTROOMS. Therefore if you need to use the restroom, it's best to look somewhere else.\n\nGreat food, efficient service, take out is preferable to dining in. I ordered two drinks for me and my friend, and while his came out in a timely manner, I watched the employees look over my ticket bc they simple didn\u2019t want to make my drink. I waited there for twenty minutes for (I ordered at 11:00 and got it at 11:18). As someone who works in fast food I understand waiting a little for a drink bc it\u2019s busy, but not making something and making everything else before one drink is ridiculous. Horrible people work there. The manager was aggressive only because we ordered some hot water because my mom's coffee was very strong.  The cashier was upset and rude. The owner of this place should have better employees Terrible .. they never get the order right and your drinks aren\u2019t even remotely the same if it\u2019s not made by the same person. Most of their bakery items are STALE!! Management says they will follow up with dissatisfied customers yet I\u2019m still waiting. Frozen drinks are ice chunks and NOT BLENDED! There are so many other Dunks nearby, should avoid this one AT ALL COSTS !\nUpdate: 1 yr later and they STILL SUCK Came here for breakfast, it was such a unique experience. The food was reasonably priced, and delicious. The service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere was chill, pleasant and festive; they play Mexican music. It has beautiful views of the Boston commons. I\u2019d come here again when in the area. Exceptional Mexican food next to Boston Common. I came in at 11 pm for a late night snack after a travel day and got a fried tilapia taco and some chicken tortilla soup. They were absolutely delicious and satisfying, Mexican comfort food at its best. I really liked their mix and match menu. So simple, but you have to know what you want. For good or ill, you may have plenty of time to make up your mind because this place can be popular, even (or especially) late at night. Stopped in on a Saturday night around 7pm and the place was busy! The line was 10+ people deep, but moving fast. The employees taking orders were quickly making everyone\u2019s food to order. The portions are quite big. The food is very tasty. The nachos had so many veggies on it. The burrito bowls were loaded with proteins and other toppings. If you go during a busy time, you may not be able to get table seating. I got the vegan chicken tacos, and my husband got the steak tacos with a side of chips and queso. Everything was so delicious and fresh! Def recommend this place! I am just reiterating what everyone else here is saying, but this  is genuinely a great place to get tacos. The atmosphere and ambiance is spot on, line moved quick, and the food tastes great! Portions are large and reasonably priced as well. They are made right in front of you, sort of like Chipotle style. The number of items they have is quite impressive, so I recommend studying the menu beforehand so as to not get overwhelmed. Enormous slices of fulfilling pizza.\n\nFinally checked out the Sal\u2019s near my office for lunch the other day, and gotta say I was not disappointed as a hungry soul!\n\nIt was a two-person shop, with a lady at the front and a guy in the back, constantly stretching doughs. The lady is typical of Boston who you can say is not nice but is kind. They work efficiently, but that\u2019s just two people manning the shop and making fresh pizzas to order, so bring some patience to wait for your hot oven-baked.\n\nAs a woman I just ordered one slice and a Greek salad. The salad was ordinary but fresh, but the pizza, oh boy, see the pictures yourself! It\u2019s Sweet Chili Steak, the second favorite of the cashier\u2019s because her most favorite was out, and this pizza will make you feel like a boss during a mundane workday lunch even eaten in front of your computer screens!\n\nI can\u2019t wait to go back on another hungry day and try the cashier\u2019s favorite flavor.\n\nAnd did I mention that by \u201cone slice\u201d they actually meant two! Really impressed with the selection and size of pizza slices.  $9 a slice but one slice is the size of two, and the pizza was SO tasty!  I\u2019m from NY and very picky about my pizza, and this was like NY pizza!!!\n\nThe manager was friendly and the ambiance was pleasant. I went in here for lunch when I walked in The African-American gentleman that was working, was a rapping some lyrics to a song at the top of his lungs. He waited until he was done to acknowledge me and asked me if I needed help as I stood there for 2min at the counter to place my order . I then asked for bruschetta pizza. He said he didn\u2019t have any. I asked for the steak and cheese personal calzone he says no I didn\u2019t make any steak .He seemed like he didn\u2019t want to work , anyways  I asked for the chicken Parm calzone and I\u2019m watching him put it together poorly. There\u2019s barely any chicken in it and the bread is soggy from the sauce that was drenched in it. Very unpleasant for the amount of money I paid. A damn good Pizza. Had the Sal's special couple of times. Always a delicious meal. Love the fresh ingredients, nice fruity tomato sauce.Only way to make it better would be different olives, as the black ones they use are kinda tasteless. Other than that it's a perfect Pizza Pretty average pizza, big slices but the price reflects this.  The guy serving us was great, working hard and nice to customers.\n\nAll the screens inside were off so i didnt see a menu or prices, and it was also super hot inside.\n\nTheres no seating, a few standing spots but i\u2019d take your pizza to the park The best burger I've had in a long time. There wasn't much of a line, and food came quickly! Try the veggie burger you wouldn't regret it Juiciest onion rings and sauteed mushrooms in the burger. You can taste the seared crust, onions, and mushrooms in every bite. Hands down the tastiest burger I've had this year. this is my 4th burger in the last 2 weeks... I just love the fact they use potatoe buns.... I haven't tried one of the specialty burgers yet b/c I just keep builinding my own.  But in my opinion the best burger spot downtown. The most tasty burgers on a very good price. And the fries are amazing! I do not write reviews however, the service here was so good that I just had to! Our server was Ben and when I tell you he was the nicest server ever I mean it. He had amazing charisma and he was constantly attentive with us. And it was our first time here and his food recommendations were on point. If you ever consider going to Estella's don\u2019t hesitate to ask for Ben because he will not disappoint! We will be coming back! I recently came to Estella for dinner to celebrate my cousin\u2019s birthday. It was such an amazing experience. The restaurant is very intimate and cozy, although seating is a little tight. The staff was phenomenal and always checked in on us. Our waitress, Ari, was such a pleasure. She was very attentive to our needs even though it was extremely busy. The food was definitely well-portioned especially since we like to order family-style (sharing everything). The drinks were also delicious and they don\u2019t skimp out on flavor. For appetizers, I would highly recommend the Estella Calamari (Rhode Island style), and the Estella Mussels! Our favorite entree was the Oxtail Rasta Pasta! It was definitely delicious as previous reviews stated. The Shorty N Mash and Hungarian Steak Filet Mignon are also definitely just as good. The food did not disappoint and you definitely will be filled. I\u2019m not a desserts person, but my family really enjoyed the Brown Butter Mini Cake and Dulce De Leche Lave Cake.  They would probably lather themselves in it. Overall, we loved the vibe and atmosphere: the drinks, food quality, and service are worth coming back for! The food was great.  I got the mushroom ravioli and it was very creamy and tasty! There were only three raviolis but portion was filling. I think the bathroom should be improved as the aesthetic didn\u2019t match the rest of the atmosphere. The wait time was long between drinks and the food. But the staff was very attentive and friendly. This is a lavender mocktail that was great for those who don\u2019t drink I recommend Estella\u2019s in Boston. The food was really good. I had the breakfast burger with a fried egg (a first for me), and it was surprisingly delicious. The bacon was crispy, the avocado was green and fresh, and the burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. My Coca-Cola was a little flat, but still decent.\n\nThe restaurant itself is super cute with a romantic vibe. The seating wasn\u2019t great, though \u2014 even with a reservation, we got stuck near the kitchen entrance. Two of us had to sit on chairs that stuck out from the booth, and plates of food kept passing right by us, which wasn\u2019t great. I constantly had to look over my shoulder.\n\nThe bathrooms were also disappointing. One sink didn\u2019t work, the other only had hot water, and the floor had toilet paper everywhere.\n\nOn the plus side, our server was really attentive and didn\u2019t mind splitting our bill, even we were a big group \u2014 that was definitely appreciated.\n\nParking looks tricky around there, so I recommend finding a garage nearby and walking over or taking the T if that\u2019s an option for you.\n\nDespite the seating and bathroom issues, the food and service made up for it. I\u2019d go back just hopefully with a better table next time! My friends & I attended brunch here yesterday afternoon. I ordered the Lobster Egg & Cheese Croissant & the Side Swipe Cocktail. Everything was delicious. The atmosphere was beautiful & our server Jasmine was very nice & attentive \u2764\ufe0f The only problem was parking. There wasn\u2019t anything available on the street, so we had to park in the garage, which was $26 for 3 hours. Just had the saddest $12 sub of my life here. One slice of lunch meat one slice of tomato hardly any cheese 2 slivers of spinach. The entire sub weighed less than a pound. Disappointing to discover after walking a half mile back to my office. Definitely will never go to this location again. The employees and managers were alright, no complaint there. Plus the portions were generously\n\nBut- When I saw this extremely dilapidated and run down looking subway, my gut told me to not eat here(quality concern), but I decided to not judge a book by it\u2019s cover and go for it. After eating the sub I got the worst stomach ache I had in sometime\u2026.. god knows what their hygiene practice/ food quality is.\n\nTrust your gut!! Humans are the only species in the planet that does something that even when it perceives(gut) danger/ unfamiliarity/ uncomfortableness. There is no other animal that knows something is not right there, and still goes there. The store has good customer service and quick service. There was a mix-up in the order I received which is understandable because the order and name were similar. I got the correct subs the day after I came back with the receipt and order history. Workers were very nice and the food tasted amazing. I bought the Italian meatball sub, point off because I'd asked for baked lays potato chips but they gave me regular chips. Only two stars for atmosphere cuz the Corners Food Court is depressing with NO rest rooms available. Otherwise the employees where very courteous & professional. The noodles had a nice texture, and the flavors of the tomato soup were strong although they weren\u2019t my personal preference. The gyoza and scallion pancakes were crunchy and tasted good :) I had the Shoyu Ramen and it was absolutely delicious! The broth was very flavorful, the Chashu was tender and cooked to perfection, and the noodles complemented the broth perfectly. Also, the service was excellent and our server was very nice! Definitely would go back! Authentic Chinese noodles. Came here 2 times during my short trip to Boston and have several vegetarian options. Definitely recommended! Stumbled upon it by accident and the tomato beef noodles were delicious, they are Yunnan rice noodles, so don't expect Japanese style noodles, I see everyone complaining about it. I was fortunate enough not to have encountered the 20% gratuity like everyone else said, I think they may have changed it. Great choice if you don't want to make your way to Chinatown for some Asian food. Very solid tasty Ramen, dumplings and crab rangoons! Quite a tight space with a very cheap interior, but an excellent place for comfort food. The service was quite unnecessarily complicated, where they make you place your order online, then it goes straight to the kitchen, but you pay for everything at the very end, and not online. You order ramen on the website, but meat and all toppings need to be added separately. There is virtually no interaction with the staff, which I find weird. Overall, fast and tasty! I sat at the bar and was greeted by this wonderful woman. I wished I knew her name. Her service was wonderful. She was the only bartender handling everything. I loved her spirit and saw her hard work. The food came out less than 15 minutes. It was super quick and tasted so scrumptious! I totally would recommend going here again. The drinks were superb. Very nice ambiance.\nService was very friendly.\nEntree  came out entirly  cold, which was fixed promptly. But the place was not that full so not sure what happened there.\nI was also overcharged by $90. This was as also fixed, but back to back mistakes like that must be noted. Got to take a start away there\n\nWhat I had:\nclam chowder\nLots of clams, lots of lardons, lots of flavor. Very good! One of the best clam chowders I've had. 5/5\n\nFrench fries:\nTaste like McDonald's fries from the early 2000s. This is a compliment. They fries rock  5/6\n\nDenver steak\nThis was a special, but was cooked perfecly, but it came out cold as die the rest of the items on the plate. Once fixed this was a very tasty dish 4/5\n\nCarrot cake:\nGigantic, moist and tasty.  4/5\n\nI would have said 4/5 overall, but with the issues I have to go with a three. Will update if my next experience goes smoother. Boston Chops has long been one of my favorite steakhouses in Boston, particularly their South End location. Recently, I had the chance to visit their Downtown Crossing outpost for the first time, and the vibes and layout felt familiar\u2014chic yet inviting. The service, as expected, was impeccable, but the food wasn\u2019t as great as its sibling location.\n\nSolid: 18oz Bone-in Ribeye\nDecent: Crispy Mushrooms, 20oz Chateaubriand, Thai Chili & Sweet soy calamari\n\nPerhaps it was an off day for the kitchen, or maybe this location simply doesn\u2019t capture the same magic as the South End spot. Either way, the dishes, especially the steaks were a bit disappointing. While seasonings were on point, both the Chateaubriand and the Ribeye had lackluster crusts, and the former initially threw me off with its aroma. It wasn\u2019t spoiled, but it lacked the freshness I\u2019ve come to expect from more popular cuts like the ribeye.\n\nAs for the starters, the fried calamari was technically well-executed, but the Thai chili sauce was too overpowering. Crispy mushrooms, on the other hand, was slightly bland. The thin batter gave the mushrooms a nice crunch, but the accompanying garlic hummus failed to elevate its umami.\n\nStill a solid steak dinner, but next time, I\u2019ll stick to the South End location and my favorites-the porterhouse and ribeye. Everything we ate was UNREAL, and our waiter Jason was incredibly kind and helpful. We came for my husband\u2019s birthday, and he really made him feel special. Will certainly be returning!! Had a fabulous dinner here last night. It wasn\u2019t super busy but our host sat my guest & I in a cozy round booth normally for 4. The wagyu dumplings appetizer is not to miss. The clear winner for mains was the wagyu & frites! They have a fabulous ros\u00e9 cremant from Alsace - sure you should drink red with beef but I can\u2019t resist bubbles. Perfect food, perfect service. What else do you need? Oh my gosh absolutely loved this place!!! The shrimp spring rolls is a must-get. It\u2019s packed with veggies and noodles but also 3 big plump shrimps in each one. And the peanut sauce was so delicious!!!\n\nI got the bbq pork Banhmi and it was HUGE. Barely could finish it but I managed to after a while. The only thing is they have limited seating so just a heads up you might not be able to eat inside but they pack the banhmi well so you can take it with you.\n\nThe BBQ pork was a bit cooled but still delicious regardless and at such an amazing price! Their veggies are all fresh which I loved!\n\nWhen I come back to Boston, definitely making a stop here again for their pho which I saw people ordering a lot besides the Banhmi. This was a great find. It was an unexpected and pleasant surprise (as I was expecting it to be overpriced and small portions) but the prices are fair and the banh mi is great! I started to go here regularly because of the excellent service, how clean everything is, and they definitely don\u2019t skimp out on anything like the meat nor is the food overly greasy/oily. It\u2019s clean and they prepare the food in front of you. I highly recommend this place as a lunch spot. I\u2019ve had all their banh mi options, haven\u2019t yet tried the other items, but can definitely say that the banh mi is excellent. My only feedback is not to overload so many raw onions in the sandwiches sometimes but that only happened twice. Really good bahn mi sandwiches! Decently sized, fair price, friendly and quick staff. What's not to like? Was looking for something refreshing to eat and came across Banh Mi Ok. It transformed my day into an amazing experience. Everyone there was cool and the avocado smoothie and passionfruit tea restored my energy for the day. Also the House special & Beef Banh Mi are \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffdwow\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffcrevitalizing and have amazing flavor! Highly recommend this place and so glad to have come across them Got a Vietnamese Iced Coffee and a Beef Banh Mi minus the pork pat\u00e9. The sandwiches are delicious here, with plenty of tasty pickled veggies on top of a bed of well seasoned meat and yummy sauces, all for less money than many other places around here. The coffee they have is also delicious, with a wonderful complex coffee flavor with a nice sweet note to it. Would 100% recommend this place for a tasty and inexpensive lunch. Everything was great from food to drinks, we did not think anything missed the mark. Sushi was very good. Food presentation was well thought out and pretty. Our waitress Erika was very attentive even after it got busy, and knowledgeable about the menu. Lively atmosphere. It is on the pricey side, but was worth it. The food and cocktails were incredible, and the service was great! Absolutely recommend. We had the spicy tuna roll, the crispy rock shrimp roll, the pork belly buns & the yuzu beef. Everything was delicious! I came here for my birthday because I came here once in previous years and this restaurant immediately became my instant favorite in Boston. My compliments to the chef!! I absolutely loved this menu and it was the perfect balance of experimental and home-like Chinese Japanese Peruvian cuisine. Be warned that almost everything on the menu is spicy in some capacity.\n\nAt the end of our meal, because it was my birthday, they brought out this boat with two glasses of wine for me and my friend. It was a delicious bubbly way to end our hot meals. One of the best restaurants in Boston! Very nice place. My only recommendation is to fix the booth directly by the door. I visited last week, and every time the door opened, we could feel the cold breeze, which was uncomfortable, especially during the winter. If there could be something added to block the draft and offer more privacy, that would improve the experience. Other than that, everything was great, and we had a wonderful time A spontaneous girls night in the city led us to Downtown. I opened up Google Maps and this immediately caught my attention. We secured a table for two and from the moment we walked in, the vibes were spectacular.\n\nA pleasant surprise to see the place packed on a Monday night, but we were seated almost immediately at a large table with cozy seats.  I\u2019m a big fan of electric/house music so it was nice listening to that throughout the evening .\n\nTiktok is my modern day Google so I was able to find some delicious looking dishes recommended  from foodies and they did not disappoint.\n\nWith the price point, we were hoping that these three dishes would be enough for us two to share and they definitely were. The plates came out tapas style with each dish coming out a few minutes after the other. We had our whole meal in front of us almost immediately after ordering\n\nThe Yuzu beef was mouthwatering and cooked to perfection. It came with side of rice, which literally melted in our mouths. The Japanese Fried Chicken was paired with a delicious sauce and it was a mouthwatering experience. We were hesitant about ordering the Sesame Noodles since it came chilled, but it paired perfectly with the other dishes and didn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nWhile we did not get any cocktails, the surrounding tables did, and they looked to die for. Will definitely have to grab one on my next visit.\n\nOur server, Valentina, was attentive and kind. At the end of the night, a gentleman who I believe was the manager stopped by our table to ask how our service was and I thought that was a nice gesture.\n\nSpontaneous night lead us to discovering a delicious spot that we will definitely come back to experience many more times in the future. 10/10 highly recommended! Every year my husbands company holds a holiday \u201cafter\u201d party and Scholars is one of the 5 bars/restaurants we go to. Every year I make my way to scholars just for the crispy coconut shrimp. It\u2019s by far the best I\u2019ve ever had! I\u2019m also not sure if it\u2019s on their menu or not! Great place for drinks and to play pool. Have come here multiple times. Love this place Our server Jennifer (tall black hair) was the nicest, funniest and most personable waitress we have ever encountered. God was good, drinks were good. Place is definitely good but nothing to brag about. Our server Jennifer would be the biggest reason we come back! We got reservations for around 10 people the same day we were planning to visit. They called to confirm what kind of seating do we prefer. Parking in the area might be an issue. The place itself is very big, has pool table, small dance floor and good music. After 9, the place turns into a crowded bar with people dancing on the dance floor. Food and alcohol menu are limited but good food and drinks altogether. Definitely a place to go and chill with group of friends. Great place with pool tables, great food, especially the hot honey pizza, and tasty drinks Super cool little coffee shop, would highly recommend. The coffee was delicious and there\u2019s breakfast sandwich I got was really good too. Staff members were quick and friendly and the environment was perfect for a coffee shop. Overall I had a great experience, you should give this place a try when you\u2019re in Boston! I stopped in for a cup of hot chocolate today. Oh boy! was it good! It was rich, chocolaty, with the right amount of sweetness (meaning not overly sweet). And furthermore,the presentation was definitely pleasing to the eyes. I'd definitely go back for more! Squeezed between Boston's gray granite facades, Thinking Cup manages to pack more studious energy per square foot than a library during finals week. Their matcha latte arrives like a zen garden in a cup, each frothy swirl suggesting the barista might have a side gig in fine arts.\n\nWhile you won't find eggs benedict or hair-of-the-dog remedies here, they've mastered the art of grilled cheese alchemy, though at $7.99, you might want to solve a few differential equations to justify the splurge. The brick-walled space plays musical chairs with an ever-rotating cast of characters: bleary-eyed students transforming caffeine into thesis pages, locals performing Olympic-level laptop camping, and the occasional tourist wondering why everyone else seems to know exactly what \"cold brew with a nitro finish\" means.\n\nThe weekend morning rush creates a sort of caffeinated musical chairs, where securing a table requires the strategic planning of a chess grandmaster. The wooden benches along the wall offer prime real estate for observing this peculiarly Boston ballet of coffee seekers and sandwich enthusiasts.\n\nFair warning: if you're planning to gather your book club of more than four people, you might have better luck finding free parking in the North End. But for solo contemplation or caffeinated t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eates, Thinking Cup proves that sometimes the best thinking happens over a perfectly poured cup. One of my favorite cafes. I love their vanilla latte, hot chocolate, breakfast burrito, and carrot cake. The cafe itself is very cozy and has a warm atmosphere. It's very well designed and I absolutely adore the rustic and vintage feel. My wife and I are visiting Boston and did the Freedom Trail tour as well as the Lantern Tour. We picked up bacon egg and cheese sandwiches yesterday- one on a muffin and one on a croissant (the croissant one was so good I ate half before getting the pic). They were both excellent. Really good thick cut bacon and yummy melted cheese.\n\nThen today we split chocolate eclair. Sooo detectible! This is a definite stop. We found the atmosphere here to be much more chill and enjoyable than another bakery down the street. Amazing cold brew coffee gallons and coffee available for local delivery. NOT A CAFE. Order online and get delivered locally. My boyfriend and I stopped here to get breakfast and were happy with the options and prices they had. There was fruit, bagels, pastries, and then breakfast sandwiches available as well as a lot of coffee. The staff was extremely friendly and fast with orders as well. There wasn't any parking, but street spots were available that I saw. Highly recommended. My company used Boston Common Coffee Co. years ago and I loved their coffee so much I continued ordering it after I left the previous org :) I am obsessed with their flavored beans and drink the Winter Wonderland year round. I will die if they stop making it! Can\u2019t wait for Pumpkin Spice to come back. And the company is just awesome too. I eat here all the time and love it, however I would not ever write a review until what happened today. My order was messed up and I had to ask after waiting some time. The staff treated this so kindly and made it seem like a big deal, I'm as easy going as they come so I was less than upset to begin with. They got me a free coffee and actually thanked me for being so kind about the whole ordeal. It was a great experience on a Sunday morning and I'll keep going back. I\u2019ve been a customer of Boston Common Coffee for many years and make regular orders of coffee. I particularly love the cold brew blend (my favorite!) and the flavored coffees. The order always arrives quickly and has everything in place. Kevin and David are also very responsive to customers. I love the coffee and am thrilled to be a customer! I come into the store about two or three times a month and I'm not from Boston but there is trash litter clutter right where you're sitting there is bugs his daughter doesn't look like has been cleaning months they concentrate cleaning the front b9f store .but I don't clean the store at all. also one of the workers was kind of being rude to wear if you try to ask for the restroom code they just shout at you they don't 1 / this particular person doesn't care about her job....\nFYI there's a lot of homeless that hang out around this area too. I have order light ice, and when I see the staff add more ice in the cup, I remind her that I want light ice and she talked back to me this is LIGHT ice. More than half of the cup. I dont know why I pay money to drink ice instead of coffee. Same experience in Nov. Jen and Zayra were friendly and gave great service helping us figure out how to use a Starbucks offer and also gave recommendations for a drink that we would enjoy. They offered to redo it when we were hesitant about cows milk which we appreciated. Good location for exploring Boston as a tourist and getting a top up on caffeine! Staying nearby and skipped this location yesterday due to the reviews. Valued the online order option, so stopped in today. Super friendly staff and I noted a number of regulars greeted by their first name come in (the old Starbucks days). Yes, it didn\u2019t feel totally spotless, but it wasn\u2019t nasty as others would have you think, and unfortunately Winter St overall (the actual street outside) isn\u2019t that clean. If you are a Starbucks regular, fear not and stop in. I asked for lite basically no ice and my entire cup was full. When I spoke to the kid who made it he basically didn\u2019t care. He offered, politely, to take the ice out or I pay for more coffee. He messed up and I\u2019d have to literally pay for it. I don\u2019t even want to drink it it probably sucks. I didn\u2019t drink it that\u2019s how much coffee I was given I could\u2019ve just got a grande and got the same amount The quality of their beans is exceptional, with every cup bursting with rich, nuanced flavors. Whether you\u2019re having a perfectly brewed pour-over or a velvety smooth latte, the attention to detail is evident. The atmosphere is cozy yet modern, making it a great spot to relax or get some work done. The staff is knowledgeable and passionate about coffee, always happy to share recommendations. If you\u2019re serious about good coffee, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommend! I liked the overall atmosphere of the cafe and the staff were very friendly. Everything was organised in a professional way, displaying their sources and products for you to browse while waiting. One thing that didn\u2019t quite scratch my itch in the cappuccino was the milk felt quite flat and lacked dimension, forcing the coffee to carry more weight of the experience. The coffee is pretty tasty. Would recommend. The staff was also kind, but very busy. Overall, it felt quite chaotic. So if that's not your jam, then avoid at peak hours. If it doesn't bother you, then definitely check this place out. Also, ordering online helps a ton. Coffee is excellent. Service was good. On a Saturday morning, it was pretty packed but there are lots of tables. Many people sit with computers for long periods of time though. They do not have gluten free bread here, so not many GF friendly options. Great coffee place in the heart of Boston across Macy's. Good quality coffee and tasty sweets. I had cappuccino and cranberry scone, UT was awesome. Delicious food for breakfast, brunch and lunch. We came in for a late brunch after exploring Boston Common, and found ourselves in for a treat. The spinach and feta omelette was fantastic, as was the ham and cheese crepe. But the real star was the orange juice that they squeeze on site every day. So delicious! Good prices, friendly staff, and a clean bathroom too. A great way to start a day in Boston. Excellent spot for breakfast\u2014super clean with amazing service. I ordered a burger with greens and fries; everything was delicious! The orange juice was incredibly sweet (in March). Even the restroom was spotless. Really glad we stopped and tried this great breakfast spot. The shashuka was delicious and had three eggs which made for a filling and nutritious meal. The avocado sandwich tasted fresh and the bread was so good. Must try their pastries, they were really warm when they came out and the chocolate croissant had lots of Nutella but wasn\u2019t overly sweet. Really great black coffee. The service was quick and our server was nice. Must try this breakfast spot! It's a nice little place, good food at a reasonable price. The only thing is that you'll leave with the smell of food on your clothes; but the service will make it worth it. Our waiter was accurate and friendly. Nice small caf\u00e9. We weren't waiting too long. Friendly employees. Had a small problem with the egg not being fried hard like requested for his burger. Issued was resolved without complaints or attitude from the waitress and the cook. The food was very good and reasonably priced. I was in Boston for work and looked up top places to have breakfast and this came up! I was not disappointed at all! The food was phenomenal and the service exceptional! I love that the music wasn\u2019t too loud and it allowed for me to have a calm and slow morning. I had the Eggs Norwegian and a Vanilla Chai Tea Latte. I also ordered a Power Smoothie to go. Everything was SO GOOD! Highly recommend! What is the ideal brunch spot?\n1. Food has to be delicious and plentiful and pretty\n2. Crowd has to be lively and tables full of smiles\n3. Host and staff have to make the experience effortless and fun despite potentially long waits and cold weather\n\nWell check check and check. Great variety of delicious brunch options from traditional to not and sweet to savory. Filling and appealing and fast. The popularity of the restaurant hasn\u2019t ruined the experience and that is quite a feat! The staff is to be congratulated on continuing to provide a top shelf experience despite the added traffic. Parents visiting students or locals enjoying a bite or pregaming the game all are welcome and all should be back! Nothing stands out more than others but I particularly enjoyed the savory dishes even though I have the worst sweet tooth. I\u2019ll be honest it wasn\u2019t what I expected upon walking in here.  It was small, a little tight with space, and the menu wasn\u2019t what I was hoping for, as far as options. The menu is has a lot of healthy options and less of the traditional selections.  But what I ordered  was delicious.  The eggs are cooked perfect and fluffy, the potatoes with the spicy sauce were amazing, and the crepes were perfect. I guess it was a perfect example of the classic saying \u201cdon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d.  I wish they had some classic dishes here though, but I get it, it\u2019s a French style spot. All in all the food was great and we would come back here. This place serves one of the best brunches I\u2019ve had in Boston. It\u2019s a small, cozy spot, but it\u2019s very popular, so be prepared for a line if you arrive after 9 a.m. I visited on a cold, rainy Sunday around 10 a.m. and had to wait about 20 minutes to get in. Despite the crowd, the line moved quickly, and the wait was absolutely worth it for the food.\n\nThe seating process is based on party size, so smaller groups or solo diners at the bar tend to get in faster. If you\u2019re a group of four, it might take a little longer. Once inside, I was impressed by how efficiently the staff handled the busy environment. We received our coffee within 5 minutes, and the food arrived about 15 minutes after ordering.\n\nThe food itself was outstanding. I highly recommend the Eggs Norwegian, but the Mediterranean Crepe is another excellent choice. The portions are generous, the flavors are on point, and the prices are fair. This place really hits the mark with both quality and service.\n\nThe only downside is the restaurant\u2019s small size, which causes the wait time. However, they\u2019re working to address that with some outdoor seating options. Overall, this place is a gem for brunch lovers. Delicious gluten free French toast!\nPlace was packed with a long line outside, but service was fast for the amount of people there. Food was worth the wait!\nSeating is tight and probably not a lot of room for strollers or wheelchairs, I\u2019d call ahead to make sure. Really nice coffee spot. Recommend if you are coming to work for a bit. They have lots of seating and coffee is really good. The pastries also looked amazing but I didn\u2019t order any, sadly I was full. Would totally come back. The coffee is pretty good! I had a cappuccino and a grill cheese ham sandwich! So good, with the whole weat bread .\nThey have different type of croissants \ud83e\udd50, cakes \ud83c\udf70, salad bowls, even macaroons.\nNice ambience , feels like you\u2019re in France. Close to the park too.\nParking on street.\nLove it ! I\u2019ve always loved going to Thinking Cup for a nice breakfast and Ofcourse mocha latte coffee! I moved to Backbay in 2020 and pandemic was really weird time but you meet local people who literally go here a lot. It\u2019s a nice neighborhood to check out! This post is long overdue and here it is! Thinking Cup , on Newbury.\n\nLots of choices for coffee shops on Newbury. How do you choose\u2026not easy.\n\nI went in and immediately noticed how many people were about. Looking closer, the cases had cakes, and other pastries.  The French hot chocolate piqued my curiosity.   Ordered a medium cup and a mini cheese cake.\n\nStaff filled my order quickly. If you go the rear and hand a left there is additional seating.  First sip of the French hot chocolate was amazing. So smooth, hot and so chocolatey. Stellar.\n\nSince it was so cold outside, I took my time and enjoyed the moment and my small meal. Cheesecake was really good.\n\nThe menu lists a grilled cheese sandwich. Can\u2019t wait to try that!  Other food. choices as well.\n\nWill return.  Bravo Thinking Cup. Well done. Very cool spot on Newbury. Tons of pastries and food and the coffee was good. Definitely a good spot to sit in and enjoy good coffee. My mocha though, had almost no mocha flavor. Tasted like a really good latte. I was in Boston for work and looked up top places to have breakfast and this came up! I was not disappointed at all!

Very cool spot on Newbury. Tons of pastries and food and the coffee was good. Definitely a good spot to sit in and enjoy good coffee. My mocha though, had almost no mocha flavor. Tasted like a really good latte. We had probably our best brunch ever (no kidding) at jm Curley.  We found another restaurant nearby by doing a Google search for \u201cbrunch,\u201d but the line was crazy so we found jmC just half a block away.  It didn\u2019t show up on the brunch search and that\u2019s a shame.  The fried pickles as an appetizer were amazing - light tempura-style batter that didn\u2019t overwhelm the slightly sweet thinly-sliced pickles and the sauce complemented it well.  The chicken and waffle bowl was AMAZING - great, unique take on this brunch classic.  Such a great combination of flavors!  The tuna poke was delicately flavored and perfectly prepared, though it didn\u2019t need as many wontons.  Service was friendly and attentive, and the prices were excellent for the high quality food we received.  Highly recommended! Had an excellent dinner here! I was surprised it was so packed on a Thursday night, so I\u2019m glad I made a reservation. I thought the salad and burger were excellent, but the spinach and artichoke dip was phenomenal. Definitely would go back! I also liked my cocktail which had elderflower and vodka in it. Early dinner here on a weekday. Easily found a spot. Our wait staff was great. Food tasted good, but not all that. Made a reservation for a Friday night at 10pm for 2 people as we were visiting from out of town and this place looked amazing online. When we arrived there was already a group of 5 people waiting for their table to be ready. We checked in at 9:50pm and were told our table wasn't ready yet, no big deal because we were early.\n\nAlmost 30 minutes go by while having to constantly shuffle around the main entrance to avoid being run into by staff members and other patrons. There is really no designated waiting area and we were trying to shove 7 people there. We have also received no updates on our table and the group waiting before us had now complained. They were able to be sat a few minutes later. We overheard that their reservation was for 9:45pm and they were sat around 10:20pm. After they were sat, we were told that our table was almost ready. We finally sat down at 10:30pm. Making a reservation is a must because other groups entered and were told there would be a 2 hour wait, but even having a reservation still means a long standing wait in a cramped area. Wasn't the most comfortable experience.\n\nWe sat and our drinks and appetizer orders were taken quickly and brought out to us fast, within 10 minutes. The waitress checked on us once at the beginning while we were all set. We ate our fried pickles which were great and sipped our drinks for a while before trying to flag her down because we had still not ordered our main dish yet. We were able to get her attention and ordered at 11pm, a full hour after our reservation slot. Again, once the order was in we got our food quickly. We were able to eat at 11:15pm. Our waitress checked on us once when our food arrived and once a bit later. There was a lull and we again had to get her attention to get the check. As we waited for our check, our water glasses were refilled for the first time after our glasses being empty for over 30 minutes. At this point the restaurant was still fairly busy, but emptier than when we arrived with it being around 11:30pm. Slow service was somewhat understandable, but still disappointing.\n\nI would also like to point out that their menu online is not up to date with pricing. This was another shock and disappointment, and seems much more avoidable. Items seemed to be anywhere from $1-$5 more expensive, which might not be a ton of money but is definitely something to note and can add up quick for larger parties. I have attached pictures for accurate pricing as of 12/6/24.\n\nOverall, the food, atmosphere, and time between ordering and receiving was fantastic. However, the conflicting menu and slow service definitely negatively affected our experience. Making a reservation for 2 at 10pm and not getting out until around 11:40pm is not what we expected at all. Where do I begin? The expresso Martini that was made on 9/11 around midnight was probably the best I had to date! So good I had to come back the next day to be sure I wasn\u2019t losing it.\n\nI also had their food and it was good for the post part. I had the popcorn chicken with fries 8/10\n\nBuffalo wings 6.8/10 the batter was a bit much it took away the concept of a good wing.\n\nOverall, This was a place I could get a decent meal and drink before midnight."

    "reviews": "The great thing about CVS is, it contains exactly what you expect it will have. CVS is the same generally speaking, anywhere you go. The employees were helpful and it is at a perfect location near the hotel and Seaport district. This is my favorite cvs. Sure, the prices are slightly higher than online and they lock up $6 toothpaste, but the staff is amazing. Every single person that works there is incredibly nice. I've never had to wait more than 30 seconds to unlock a product and they are always offering to help. I arrived at 10:55 p.m. only to find out that both entrances were blocked. I tried to get into any customer was leaving and I was bum-rushed by the staff and they were screaming at me that they were closed I said to them that it's not 11 p.m. yet and the door should not be locked before 11 p.m. but the route Indian Middle Eastern guy was in my face aggressive and very very rude as if I didn't hear him or understanding. I heard and understood very clear both of them The guy ended the girl, however their obnoxiousness was not necessary or called for at this moment when I could have basically got in my drink within 30 seconds in back before they even thought of I even did anything good or bad to their store. It's a legal to have your establishment closed doors before the actual time God forbid I needed an emergency God forbid I needed something to save my life but this was not the customer value store that they claim to be and they really need to replace the entire staff that work here they need new jobs this is nothing type of energy that the seaport deserves. I just want to really appreciate and praise the manager, Kass; I left my $20 cash-back at the self-checkout at 9pm last night and he was right there to handle that oversight as I was already out the door. He took my phone call the next day, confirmed my purchase with the last 4 of my debit card. I picked it up a few hours later and had the pleasure of meeting him. I walk 10 miles a day and will make this CVS a permanent stop on my walks. Thank you so much for hiring the right people. Busy, city vibe- but they have everything a convenient pharmacy should, and the staff were volunteering to help me find things, get in line, and even check me out at the self check out (I somehow messed it up). Best random pharmacy stop of my vacation/travel life, actually. Madelin was awesome beginning to end. She greeted me when we walked in and ended up helping me solve an issue. She was so helpful and so friendly. She is definitely a great asset to the store. The store itself is clean and pretty stocked. Great location for traveling through South Station. Not a single person employed here speaks English. That's not an exaggeration. You'll never be able to pick up photos, a prescription etc. not a soul can understand you Generally speaking I like to shop at CVS   I like the CVSCare program and utilize my $10 coupon every month. And the coupons on the receipt are good to use also. While the prices are generally higher than I can find elsewhere I often buy items that are on special and using the coupons makes the overall cost very reasonable. And I like the CVS brand items for their price and quality Locking up pints of ice cream and baby products? Dystopian. Locks ice cream behind a locked freezer, requiring you to wait around like an idiot to have a snack. Let us snack without shame! Reviews have largely been negative here, but I decided to check the situation out myself today. Only a few minutes wait at the teller line. Friendly and helpful staff and a helpful branch manager. Despite notes from the branch they are indeed welcoming new customers Bank ATM at this location took a deposit and went into error mode and didn't register the deposit.\n\nCalled the bank, and no one answered the phone. Don't ever use this branch. Initially, I was concerned about visiting this Financial Center in Boston because it did not have a promising rating on Google. However, to my surprise, my experience as a client was nothing short of extremely positive! This was all thanks to the irreplaceable senior banker, Rommel, whom I was fortunate to have as an assistant when resolving my issue. What struck me the most about Rommel was his professionalism, positive attitude, and sincere willingness to help. He guided me through all the available options for resolving my issue and maintained a calm and positive demeanor even when I was feeling stressed. He went above and beyond in his efforts to solve my problem. Even though, in the end, the problem could not be resolved immediately (due to my neglect), Rommel provided guidelines on how to proceed once I met all the terms and conditions, enabling me to solve the problem shortly thereafter (which I did). Working with Rommel has been a genuine pleasure as he is an exceptional specialist and a true asset that makes this particular BoA financial center shine! I had the pleasure of working with Rommel at Bofa more than a year, and I must say that while I wasn't very impressed with the bank as a whole, Rommel was an exceptional specialist and person. From the moment I reached out to him, Rommel was professional, courteous, and very knowledgeable. He took the time to understand my unique financial situation and provided me with a range of customized solutions to help me achieve my goals.\n\nWhat impressed me the most about Rommel was his attention to detail and his willingness to go above and beyond to ensure my complete satisfaction. He was always available to answer my questions and provided me with regular updates throughout the entire process. He truly made me feel like a valued customer.\nbusiness! Thank you, Rommel. It's truly pleasure to work with you. This place is an absolute joke! Raj, one of the representatives, couldn't do worse. He was extremely negligent and transferred over  $45,000 US to the wrong bank account and couldn't care any less to mitigate the damages. This was extremely infuriating for all of us and no one seemed to care about this place.\nHe never came to apologize and even walked in front of us after this issue was resolved and, in a very prepotent way, laugh at us and walked away. What kind of service is this? My entire family will be leaving this bank since this issue was the most disrespectful experience we've ever been through.\nThank you for making my mom cry BoA Albert was really nice and helpful, the service impeccable! For any international travelers and tourists who are looking for a short term package I can recommend the prepaid SIM options for unlimited data. The connection is stable, speed (5G) is fast. Terrible customer service! I enter the shop at 66 Lincoln St. and all 3 employees are with the heads down scrolling on their instagram. One of them turns to greet me and after I explain shortly that I would like to activate my Tourist Plan, she replies \"We 're a corporate store here, we don't do these things\". After being shocked by her response I try to tell her what she can do to help me. She said \"I can give you a chair and you can call customer service\". After sitting there and having spoken to 5 employees at customer care for 45 minutes (literally!) until I solve the problem, the only thing that these 3 employees at the store did was accept a payment from a guy. Nothing else. And for this they are getting paid. Shout out to the Management of T-mobile out there! Horrible experience today!\nVisited this place today to know about upgrading mobile handsets of my corporate account. While I was talking to the executive my wife who was looking at mobile accessories saw the restroom sign and went to use it.... so this executive stopped talking to me midway and ran behind my wife and started knocking on the door saying it\u2019s employee only and outsiders are not allowed to use it.\nApparently there was a sign which read employee only but not on the ladies section.\nI get it they do not want anyone other than employees to use the restrooms, but if a customer uses the service- would you make them come out of the toilets that too to a woman? Is this how you treat your customers ? Why not lock the doors and keep the keys with you if you don\u2019t want customers to use the restrooms!\n\nWe apologized to the employee and we didn\u2019t say much, but it\u2019s extremely difficult to process and forget the way we were treated.\nWon\u2019t be visiting this disrespectful place ever again. Abysmal customer service was what stuck in my mind after my last visit.  I accompanied my mom to try and help her pay a T-mobile bill after cutting ties with T-mobile.  The young and visibly un-enthused employee there asked for my mother's phone number, tapped it onto her tablet, and the account didn't come up.  The employee then proceeded to give up entirely and say there's nothing else she can do to help us.\n\nI know she can look up my mother's account through other methods.  T-mobile account number, social security, and etc.  But nope, she didn't bother with those options.  Instead she just pushed the both of us out of the store.  That is not customer service, not by a long shot. Angela from the Lincoln St location in downtown Boston was excellent! Really knew her stuff and was such a great help with walking us through switching our SIM cards This is unreal! USPS is open till 12 a.m. and open on Sunday. And plenty of parking spots in the center of downtown Boston. I first read the review on Google, and they said this USPS really opens till midnight and you won\u2019t have any issues finding a parking spot. I was not sure and could not believe it at first, but it is real! The staff is also friendlier than at other USPS locations. 5/5! A worker was very rude and belittling to a customer who was just trying to buy stamps, the customer had given this worker the money for the stamps and the lady took the money without giving the lady stamps. when the lady asked for her money back the lady kept saying no. she kept calling the woman stupid and telling her to couldn\u2019t do math, and it was very offensive to talk to a woman who\u2019s first language is obviously not english all this. she made the woman cry and the manager gave the lady her 100 dollars back, leaving the poor old lady crying. The worker was unremorseful and went with no warning for yelling at the woman then refusing her service. A tracking number letter. Had a letter get to this location for Boston Delivery.2/17\nWas fowarded to Raintree Ma, 2/17\nTo Weston Ma, 2/18\nTo Middle Essex/Essex 2/19\nBACK to Boston. 2/20,\nTHEN:\nTo Nashua N.H. 2/21\nCALLED THE BOSTON  OFFICE, Their response?\n\"We dont know where it is??? Although its Been to Boston twice?\nAvoid this location. They don\u2019t address any issues and seem completely unqualified, including the branch manager. Their only concern is to get rid of you as quickly as possible. I recommend using other postal service providers. Great location right off Summer St.\nAlong the harbor\n\nEasy to walk to /find with great signage.\n\nCute spring decor up to welcome guests and patrons at the entrance/exit\n\nThe worker/cashier at the desk was a bit sassy with me when responding to my question (maybe she was having a bad day?) but other than that it was a nice location. This boutique is so amazing neat wonderful colors , great selections. I fell in love with this beach bag came with wristlet. The owner is so wonderful and friendly i definitely felt the good energy.. definitely recommend while visiting Marina Bay !!! Just had the most delicious caponata (eggplant) sandwich on homemade focaccia and a lemon granita made by Mario at Terre D'Italia. Plus gracious hospitality and a spectacular view over the water. A hidden gem! Stopped in for an iced coffee and an iced mocha. Amazing service, delicious coffee, and relaxing view. Beautiful and beautifully made clothes always.

Barsegyan, a senior relationship banker at Webster Bank, and I must say that her customer service was truly exceptional. Ligiya was professional, friendly, and went above and beyond to help me with my banking needs. She took the time to understand my financial goals and provided personalized recommendations that were tailored to my specific situation. Her communication was clear and effective, and she was always available to answer any questions I had.\n\nI was particularly impressed with Ligiya's ability to explain complex financial concepts in a way that was easy to understand. She was patient and took the time to ensure that I was comfortable with the solutions she proposed. Her dedication to providing excellent customer service was evident throughout the entire process.\n\nI highly recommend Ligiya and Webster Bank for anyone looking for top-notch banking services. They truly understand the meaning of customer service and go above and beyond to ensure that their clients are satisfied.\n\nThank you, Ligiya, for your exceptional service! My experience at this bank as been more than 5 stars!! Djalal Khoulani is one of the bankers at this location and he is always professional, knowledgable, experienced and gets me in & out of there as quickly as possible.  I highly recommend this branch to all. They make you feel like family! Very nice staff. I went to open an account and it was too easy, too quick and with a very good welcoming and smiling faces. Espacially mr Matthew Branford-White, with his beautiful british accent \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a The worst Very bad customer service \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb I went to this seven eleven yesterday after a few months.  I thought I wouldn't come back since I was yelled at and harassed by a customer that appeared to have many problems. I wanted a diet soda from the fountain.  The diet coke was just water and I took a regular ginger ale.  There are diet sodas in bottles but their prices are higher and you get a smaller serving.  I went to the front register, and there was an unpleasant odor.  I asked the person if they would refill the diet coke (I had seen someone refilling it in the past) and he shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.  I was also overcharged for one item.  There is a Massachusetts law that a customer should get a full refund when overcharged.  I didn't mention this to the front worker as I thought he wouldn't do anything about it with his\" I don't care\" attitude. For all the customers who said they have had excellent experiences at this store, I am glad for them.  That has not been the case for me, I will never shop there again.  I realize that my not shopping there won't make a difference in total sales. There are other 7-11 stores that are better. Cashier was rude af, but the shop is always well stocked if you're willing to put up with micro aggressions, likely due to the amount of people begging at the door 24/7, no one wants to enter. This 7-11 is an experience unto itself that should absolutely not be missed. I stopped in on Christmas Eve to buy holiday scratch tickets and some MegaMillions ($1bn jackpot!). Every part of my experience exceeded expectations.\n\nA drunk woman about 20 years my senior was playing the numbers game like she was at Encore and had $65 in winnings after her several dozen tickets had been checked. While we waited she told the group of 3 uncomfortable tourists in front of me about her 103 grandchildren (that she knows of). Absolute perfection.\n\nThe tourists bought their Diet Sodas and scuttled away, and it was my turn to order. Unlike most lottery retailers the staff at 7-11 can't be bothered to organize and label their scratch tickets by cost, so I needed to ask if the giant baubled Xmas tree ticket was $10, after being confused by my question the clerk was able to confirm the price accurately for me.\n\nThere was a second round of confusion when I asked for 10 of them, but when he realized I wasn't joking and confimed it would cost $100, he expertly pulled the roll out of the dispenser, dropped one side of it to the floor and quickly counted out my tickets, then added my MegaMillions and completed the transaction without any fuss.\n\nI honestly can't understand the negative reviews of this location. It is well lit. The staff and other patrons are friendly and helpful. The stock is fresh and easily accessible and I felt totally safe and comfortable throughout my transaction. I will absolutely be patronizing this location again in the future. I\u2019m unsure what the last reviewer meant by this is one of the most realistic locations. Hi unfortunately I did not have a great experience. The store is supposed to open at 7 AM every day and around 7:08 PM I joined three other people who were waiting for it to open. I start at work at 7:30 AM and really wanted to get a five hour energy to help me get through the day. However, the only indication of the store operating was the loud classical music that was being played by speakers on the outside of the building that had been reinforced with security cages. The music is meant to frustrate homeless people who may try to loiter around the store. I am unsure how I feel about this, but I will say it is pretty irresponsible of them to not open on time on the first work day of 2022. Especially, being in downtown Boston they should realize the number of customers that they lose by being late. This place is not open 24/7.  I went to this location around 5am and there was a guy inside just sitting on the side claiming the cashier was downstairs occupied. First of all why do you have a random person supervising your store if they do not work there? I honestly don\u2019t know how this location is even open still. They need to stick to regular business hours.  Don\u2019t ever waste your time and come here after hours.

Macy's in Boston is a fantastic shopping destination that truly lives up to its reputation. The store is always clean and tidy, making for a pleasant shopping experience. The selection of clothes is impressive, with a wide range of styles and brands to choose from. Whether you're looking for something casual or more formal, Macy's has you covered.\n\nThe service at Macy's is another highlight. The staff are kind and helpful, always ready to assist with any questions or needs. Their friendly demeanor adds to the overall positive experience of shopping at this location.\n\nOverall, Macy's in Boston offers everything you'd expect from this iconic department store. With its clean environment, great selection of clothes, and excellent service, it's a top choice for shoppers in the area. Highly recommended! The store is about what you come to expect when you visit a Macy\u2019s across the United States. They have departments for Men, women and children. Good clothes and you can sometimes get a deal. The store was well-organized despite the busy season, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I was thrilled to find a wide variety of quality items at unbeatable discounts. It was a great opportunity to shop and save\u2014definitely one of the best Black Friday shopping experiences I've had! Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. Originally I went to Marshall's to bargain hunt for clothing but I ended up falling in love with the shoe section great selection good prices and be prepared to get lots of compliments!!! Good collections with reasonable prices Went there last night to try to find some Boston sports team apparel, but unfortunately all they had was Patriots stuff.  We\u2019ll try back again next time.  They do have a large selection of all other clothes at good prices. Good as always , branded clothes but no expensive. But be careful with the quality of some things. But it\u2019s ok. \ud83d\udc4d Conveniently located in the city center. The collections are really good.\n\nYou\u2019ll be definitely pleased by the good deals over here. Excellent store. It's economical yet the clothes are good quality. I was in Boston twice and both times I did my shopping here. The staff are also very friendly and helpful. The subway stations are very close as well. I will continue to recommend this place to everyone. I popped in yesterday 3/03/25 and received really nice and friendly service\u2026 but after the service I received today 4/03/25, I left the store in tears.\n\nI was served by Damien and he was the rudest and disrespectful person I have ever been served by.\nHe Did not greet me like  the other employees politely did with other customers, took about 20 minutes to take my clothes off the hangers, threw my new clothing on the counter and then threw them in my bag, completely screwed up and not folded at all\n\nI am a very polite person and always show respect. I don\u2019t know why I was treated this way!?\nAfter having an awful service, I was still polite and thanked him and his response was \u201cYEP\u201d\n\nReally unacceptable, considering I am a young women, I was visiting Boston and I was polite, patient and respectful throughout. I did not deserve this treatment low price, average quality\ncheaper than tj maxx and marshalls Clothing retailer selling decent quality goods for super fair prices. This specific location is very large and hosts a huge selection.\n\nWomen\u2019s clothing comprises two and a half floors (of four), men\u2019s get a half floor, and kids get a half floor. There is also a small section on the third floor for a limited selection of home goods.\n\nI docked a star because the escalator from the second to third floor was out of order, leaving only their slow elevator to get you to the men\u2019s section. That was pretty annoying since they only allow two shoppers in an elevator at any given time due to COVID, making it quite the excursion.\n\nOverall pretty good and prices are hard to beat. This place is awesome it have 4 floors and about everything in cloth you can think of for a really good price is a really fun place with lots to look at I definitely recommend checking this place out, the place is clean and the staff are very nice they'll be more than happy to help you just don't come here with someone who doesn't like going out Great store that always seems to have a coat, shirt or pair of pants or shorts I like. Big store with a big selection. I always tend to buy something when I pop into this store. The security here is top notch because once a homeless person comes in trying to steal something they have workers already waiting for them near the exit. You have to take the escalator to the second floor to enter the store but it's good for the store for anyone trying to steal here. This is not a well-maintained store. Although the foot traffic was quite busy, the inventory was strewn all over the place, with many items mislabeled. Many of the bins and racks were unorganized, as if a tornado had blown through here. I ran out as quickly as I could to escape this place. Good selections of brands with competitive prices Love the store but disgusted by the customer service I witnessed tonight. An older Asian lady was trying to check out and it was evident that she did not speak English, as she was not responsive to the conversation with the cashier (pictured below). As a loyal tjmaxx customer, I\u2019m aware all cashiers ask if you will be using/signing up for their credit card. However, the cashier crossed the boundary when he did not stop repeating the same question and asking for her personal information to sign up for the credit card, even when she eventually said she doesn\u2019t speak English. He then asked if she has an ID, and she was confused and reluctantly gave him her ID. He then scans her ID and proceeds onward with the application. She fills it out until he asks for her SSN, which was when she realized something was wrong. He then made the assumption she spoke Spanish or \u201cespanol\u201d to which she did not reply and attempted to get other cashiers to speak Spanish to her. I understand working hard at your job, but attempting to scam an old Asian lady to open a credit card is beyond me. Also, I luckily had the pleasure to have him as my cashier after and he was not as pushy with having me open a credit card. Really well organized and so clean! Lots to choose from I had an amazing experience!! Zena is the best! My hair was in bad shape prior to Zena\u2019s work. Very grateful. She is very kind and the salon is very lively. She transformed my hair into amazing work. She did such an amazing job. I have been seeing Paula for haircuts and balayage for the past 18 months, and cannot recommend her highly enough! Her balayage is always super natural, beautifully blended, and lasts for months. Paula is very intuitive - she knows exactly what I'm after and what will suit me, even when I struggle to articulate it myself. She is an amazing stylist! LADIES!!!\nLooking for a hair stylist that specializes in balayage and color correction? Paula is the QUEEN to go to! I came across Paula on Instagram and was awed by her work. My hair before meeting Paula needed A LOT OF WORK. She is the type of stylist that knows what works best for you! Long story short she is the best around! I've received so many compliments after I started seeing Paula. Her energy and passion for hair shows how much she truly loves her job. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !! You can\u2019t go wrong with Paula. She is the best!! Balayage is her specialty. She will take care of you and make sure you feel comfortable through every step of the process (detail oriented/excellent communication). She does custom styling that suits your needs/uniqueness and her color correction and blending skills are top notch. I recently went short and her haircuts have also been consistent. Keep in mind that she prioritizes the health and integrity of your hair so don\u2019t expect to go bright blonde in one session \u2014especially if you have dark or already processed hair. Thank you Paula! I always step out of the salon feeling confident and pretty. For reference, I have fine, straight, black Asian hair.\n\nBackstory: In search of a new balayage artist after both me and my old stylist relocated further away from each other a couple of times and I could not make that 1+ hour drive to follow her anymore\u2026 I first went to see Paula in Jan 2023 after having a bad bleaching/highlighting session with another salon I was trying out in Allston who used a cap and was not mindful with highlight placement at all (pulled out strands randomly all over cap and blindly bleached). Paula thankfully saved my hair (the work was tedious but she was very patient and took care). I\u2019ve been going to her ever since and the trust was built. Her sense of humor and beautiful personality is a plus. I don\u2019t usually write reviews unless my experience is exceptional. I have been going to Paula for 2 years now. When I first went to her my hair was dry, brittle and a burnt orange color. Slowly, without damaging my hair, she was able to bring my hair back to life. My hair is a healthy chocolate brown now.  Paula listens with care about what style I want and always meets my expectations. She never cuts too much, as I want my hair long, but makes sure to give me the exact layers I need. Not only is she a great stylist, she\u2019s also a wonderful person. One year on my birthday, I came in to get my hair done, and Paula had purchased me a little birthday cake. She really loves her clients.  She is warm, hilarious, genuine and welcoming every appointment. I trust her completely. NEVER going anywhere else. Highly recommend! 10 out of 10! Thank you for being amazing, Paula! Horrible customer service. I called costumer service about reprinting my card and they said they couldn\u2019t do anything which was totally different to what the customer service person told me therefore going against headquarter orders. I offered to give them my social number as that is a way of identification and they said they couldn\u2019t when under federal law the social security number is a form of identification. I went to Another citizens down the street and they immediately printed my card after I gave them my social. I told them what happened and they told me they would report the location since they are not allowed to do that. Horrible experience I would recommend to everyone not to go there as they did not do their job and rushed me out. Last year I went to this bank to change my last name because I get married and I wanted my account to have my new name. So I want there and the guy after 15 minutes helped me he struggle so much to do the change I don\u2019t know he was manager or supervisor he was in one of those offices. I asked him in the end when you will send me new card with my new information he said you don\u2019t need it I said are you sure he said yes. And here we are after a year receiving my new card with my old information I don\u2019t know this people what they doing if they don\u2019t know how they can say I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know and all set losing my time in this place. If I could give this branch 0 stars I would. Had an appointment today at 12:30. Got to the branch at 12:29 and to my surprise there was a sign out front saying the branch was closed until 2pm. No one bothered to call me to let me know beforehand nor to reschedule to a different date. Waste my lunch break for nothing. I tried giving Citizens multiple chances even though they keep screwing me over in new and creative ways. This is the worst customer service I have ever received from a bank. I will be switching asap. The branch manager Jenny C it's not helpful at all... that's unless, of course, if it's something that can benefit her like opening a new bank account but when her customers need assistance with something else... nope! Jenny is not there for you. I can count more than one occasion that I went there for help and just wasted my time.  Also, their customer service in the bank it's more than mediocre. I pretty much got hanged up on every time I call. The branch is ugly and small and I WILL BE TAKING MY BUSINESS SOMEWHERE ELSE. Jenny C almost made me consider changing banks completely! That's how terrible her service is.  Thank you for nothing JENNY!!! They are rude and unhelpful and I would NOT recommend going here at all! The worst Citizens experience I\u2019ve EVER had! Absolutely a completely understaffed, not knowledgeable group\u2026. Went into pick up a paid for item  , paperwork in hand, asked for assistance\u202620 minutes later wanted my husband to come in, explained he was in the truck just picked him up from radiation treatment & he is on full oxygen. Explained if she looked at the paperwork the lovely professional on the phone who set this up listened to our dilemma had added myself and my phone number and I was authorized to complete the transaction\u2026 now 45 minutes later waited &  I showed her my license and she opened the lock box.\n\nThe instructions say you just go in type in your phone number but it does not work that way\u2026you have to show your ID to overworked staff\u2026 a nightmare\u2026.\n\nThe women who walked thru the purchase should be highly applauded\u2026 she is 9 years cancer free and completely understood how difficult these times are.\n\nWould never return to that store\u2026 not the staff\u2019s problem just Verizon should cut back on their enormous advertising budget and hire and train their staff to live up to the fantasy of all the ads. It\u2019s  for cable tv  not cell phone 3-2025 Atfirst for months my service from Verizon was fine. Then my tv stations started pixelating .Two repair men later and being inconvenienced it Turned out the problem was from their building . I told them It still was not fixed 100 %!\nI called today ;\nfirst  - it\u2019s worse than ever .\nSecond they  are overcharging me!\nThird -I want a regular remote .this doesn\u2019t recognize what I\u2019m saying and I spent a fortune on batteries!\nAfter 41 minutes on the phone and three nasty male bullies.one said my bill is right / I have proof it\u2019s not and Im supposed to have lifeline.\nThen Mark started barking orders at me and acting crazy not listening to what\u2019s wrong with the stations! I asked for a supervisor. On hold so long I hung up!\nGlenn called me back  wouldn\u2019t let me get a word in either! Mark lied and said he didn\u2019t see a problem - neither one let me talk!\ud83d\ude21RUDE talking  loud over  me and trying to intimidate me ! Continued Yelling that it was my brand new tv and a wire that connects to their box -so my problem not theirs! Their guy that came her last time said all my wires are good ! I told Glenn I am going over your head ! He said there is no one over me IM a supervisor. I\u2019ll start my calls tomorrow! He had the nerve to text and email me that the repair was completed! IT WASN\u2019T EVEN CLOSE!  Please see pictures!\nPlease I had an amazing experience with Tash, he went above and beyond made the process smooth.He made sure  I could get all of my phones shortly before closing. I highly recommend using him I came to receive a new phone and something wasn\u2019t completely I went all the way home for Simba to tell the paper should go though in 20 mins came back 20 mins later for him to tell me that it wasn\u2019t going to go through that fast now I\u2019m stuck waiting without a phone then I get in the phone and the transfer me to someone who can take care of off it which is something he could have did he just ain\u2019t wanna do it because it was 35mins to close The verizon associate, Simba, was amazing! There was a fraudulent purchase of an Iphone and line added to my account in FL, he helped me through every step I needed to take. He made sure the customer service and fraud center calls I made had the right information and he even spoke to one associate on the phone himself to help ensure I get my rewards back. So thankful for his help in a very messy situation! Had a great experience with the cashier Emi and the manager Lyv helping me get my new card sent to me and dealing with all the confusion but also thank you so much for showing me patience and grace. Thank you for having such a welcoming environment and a beautiful store with beautiful loving people that work here! A black female Employee from Old Navy verbally  me at the Downtown Boston Dunkin Doughnut store. I was in the middle of trying to pay for my order and she approached me and stood right next to me. I asked her to please step aside so I can pay for my order. She went off on me claiming I am jealous of her. Keep in mind she's wearing a \"Do Rag Scarf and looks like she rolled out of bed.\" While wearing the Old Navy badge and tag. I complained to the manager on duty DAN. He claims he will investigate. Which I don't feel confident he will. I won't be shopping there or The Gap anymore. Good clothes , reasonable prices Staff was super friendly and there was a lot of clothing choices. Great experience Love their clothes and their online store has more variety than some of their brick and mortar The manager Kathy was extremely friendly, professional and helpful. She helped us hold furniture while we continued shopping and keep it all organized. The cashier Yarialis was efficient, courteous and kind during our long checkout.\nWhile there is no parking at the store, the lot is nearby at 33 Arch Street. The store is centrally located and the team helps you get your goods out the door! Wonderful store. Shopping here is like a treasure hunt! Dog friendly store with a huge pet section, polite girls. Looks great.  Kitchen cook wear, mugs and glass cups, rugs, chairs, pasta, soup, chips, wall decorations, and more. Such a large store with lots of items I don\u2019t usually see at my local home goods stores. Coffee was really good, not too sweet. Baked goods were delicious, and I\u2019m from the south so I know what a good biscuit is. We didn\u2019t eat, but every time I passed a soup and sandwich I almost caved and got one. Wish we had a Tatte in Texas. Conveniently located next to the public gardens and Mass General Hospital, there is an amazing coffee shop with super tasty baked goods. Come check it out. Get away from the Bucks and the Dunks, because you can get that anywhere else. Support local and support artists, because that's who these folks are, and they express their talent through good eats Food was excellent! I had the fresh mozzarella sandwich and cheesecake dessert cup. Very busy, but we had good service. More dining area would be great. The  best place if you want to spend time in a cozy atmosphere and delicious food.\nGood choose  of sandwiches, salads, breakfasts, coffee and bakery\n\nThanks  Tatte Everything was so delicious! Definitely adding to my must go places. If you like espresso and a good cappuccino definitely go here you will not be disappointed. I ordered the house latte and house breakfast today. Plus a couple delicious cookies to go! I've literally gotten shoo'd away by the desk person at this location. Any other time I go, I leave after a 10 minute wait. Without what I came for. total waste of time Long time Citizens customer here, soon to be ex.  In my many experiences with Citizens, they consistently make errors with paperwork, refuse to take accountability, lack knowledge, have unworkable policies and systems, lock me out of my accounts then can't figure out why they did it -- after making me wait on hold for...40 minutes this time.  I'm a former non-profit org treasurer. Suggestion from experience: don't do business with Citizens Bank.  Every other bank that I deal with is far more competent.  Many safer options. Rude and unprofessional phone call Homeless man inside so I can\u2019t use ATM Very impressive Dinner and drinks were delicious. Very friendly staff and the atmosphere was very nice. Cozy place with the best service and food. Recommended for every Boston traveler. I am the experience creator for our company in Illinois and our client was had their conference in Boston last week 10/6-10/08. I researched Vintage Restaurant as an option for the group's welcome party. After doing a sight tour and meeting the owner David, we were convinced that Vintage was the place for their event and they did not disappoint! This was a full buyout event with a mixology class activation for the group.\nLeading up to the event, David and Laura were very helpful, very patient and very accommodating. The group had very specific requirements for food. Whether it was gluten free, dairy free, vegan, vegetarian, the Vintage team was able to accommodate all of the needs. David worked very closely with their executive chef to make sure all dietary restrictions were met.\nOn the day of the event, David and the team exceeded our expectations with the service, the taste of the food and the fun we had during the mixology class! What a wonderful experience this was for our clients.\nDavid, Laura and team - thank you so much for everything you did to make our client's event a huge success! All of the emails, phone calls and service on the day of was just phenomenal! Thanks a bunch! I just landed in Boston and had a lite and delicious dinner here. The wings were crispy and not too hot just the way I like them! The Caesar salad was super fresh with just the right amount of dressing. The salmon was perfect. The  aperol  spritz made by Gina was excellent. Cute, friendly and casual and right across the street from Boston Downtown Hilton Fanueil hall. The desserts I witnessed looked great. They aim to please and care about great customer service!!! As Arnold said....I\u2019ll be back! Stopped here for a quick drink before going elsewhere for dinner and wish we had stayed.  The bartender was great..I forget her name but she made the best berry mojito I have ever had.  They have a good wine list and lots to offer on the dinner menu.  I've gone there years ago and recall the food being really good.  It's a nice atmosphere..large bar area which is where we sat and a great location.  I will definitely return and next time stay for a meal! The best and the worst black and white traffic cone I've ever seen in the water. Can confirm other reviews that there are no tables and the service is horrible. Waited 4 hours for service from the establishment. Left in disappointment and frustration. However the view was amazing so 4 stars It\u2019s literally a black and white cone on a small pile of rocks. Must see. I was told they had great appetizers, but getting a table is pretty much impossible.  And don't expect prompt service from the wait staff--I seated myself and ended up being rescued by the coast guard and treated for dehydration/exposure before anyone even came by with breadsticks.  Nice view of the harbor.  Also, haunted. Fantastic little stone cone with a dark past 9/10 would choose  as a great wedding venue for mermaid/human weddings. Good city backdrop and plenty of parking at low tide as mentioned above. I get the hype now. It\u2019s that kind of local spot that doesn\u2019t try too hard because it doesn\u2019t have to. The line was long (as expected), but it moved fast. I got the sandwich, fresh bread, stacked with meat, and somehow still affordable.The staff have the kind of chaotic, hilarious energy that makes waiting in line actually fun.Legit one of the best lunch spots around. Tried this sandwich place for the first time and it was solid. Definitely a fair price for what you get ($13.50 for a small sandwich + chips + drink). I just thought the sandwiches were a bit one note and lacked intense flavor. This is when I think about the idea of having salt, fat, acid, and heat. The subs were definitely hot coming out of the oven! But for example, for the steak sub we got, it definitely needed more cheese and marinara sauce. Chicken pesto was decent though and the bread they use is stellar! I love getting the chicken salad sandwich. Ever since they changed new owners I taste a big difference in the chicken salad. It\u2019s feels really watery and lacks the flavor it used to have. Good prices for good sub. I got the Sicilian steak, need seasoning or sauce or something. Overall, a good feed. Sandwiches are fine (but expensive). Tuna is better than the turkey.\n\nHowever, I accidentally ordered two orders by mistake online and didn't realize it until later. The restaurant refused to give me a credit because they already made the sandwiches. As an owner of a restaurant, I would never do this, even if the customer was wrong, so have to knock them down a score for this. Stopped by while waiting for my train since I could use my app rewards, and I am not disappointed! Staff was super friendly and diligent with their work. I ordered multiple items and they were all perfect. Will definitely be returning! Coffee was extremely sweet, which was slightly annoying. Service was extremely fast and the workers were all very nice. I also ordered a bagel with cream cheese and they gave it to me on the side, which again was slightly annoying. They have a 20 minute sitting rule, since they\u2019re across from the bus station, but didn\u2019t enforce it for me (the place wasn\u2019t very full though), which was very nice. I almost eat tomato pesto everyday. But this is the best one I have ever got \ud83d\udc4d I\u2019ve given DD 3 stars, because that\u2019s all DDs. The donuts are not particularly fresh, and that\u2019s mainly because their main purpose is to inject a huge amount of sugar into your body in three bites. The selection is not great either.\n\nThe coffee is weak, but strangely, I love it. Don\u2019t, however get any DD to add sugar to your coffee, unless you\u2019re a horse, literally a horse.\n\nThis particular DD is one of my favs, thought. The service is efficient and accurate (and pretty friendly). And as I said, somehow I like the coffee. Just go elsewhere for a real donut. One person to work the walk up and App orders...the guy is doing well, his manager needs to be replaced.\n20 minutes to order a coffee is insane, they cater to people too lazy to get in line. Pick one, a store or a walk up. Open early on a Sunday morning, which is great. Had a full English breakfast. The food was pretty good. Certainly filled me up. Is it worth $16? I guess so, especially when a pot of tea on top was $2.50. (Picture excludes the 3 rashers of bacon I quickly snaffled)\n\nWatched the footy as well. It was a shame there was no volume.\n\nDo have to say, though, that I find it amusing, somewhat disrespectful, that a British pub plays lots of music by Irish bands! I liked the vibes of this place. Had a good pub feel to it. Beer selection was good and the steak and onion pie was stellar. They elected to play background music instead of the audio of the footy matches, so that was a bit of a bummer. 4 stars would go again but ask for some sound for the match. The food was not really good and actually horrible compared to other restaurants in the area where I\u2019ve had their Sunday roast, I also wanted Jameson wings, but I was told no, they have Jameson chicken so I asked if I could get wings and just have it tossed in the Jameson sauce like the chicken and I was told no, so this is a one and done and if you are coming here for the Sunday roast just go somewhere else instead We were hotel guests and had our breakfasts there. The food was very good and the service was kind. FYI - There is NO WAY this restaurant is less than 4.7/4.8 even on its worst day with the servers and cook calling out.\n\nI had the brussel sprouts, the fish and chips, and should\u2019ve ordered a lot more. I stumbled upon this great pub after checking out some suits across the street and was not disappointed. Ben was a great server, the cook knows what they are doing, and the management team gets a thumbs up too (based on their selection of both staff and operation). If I\u2019m ever within close proximity, I\u2019ll be stopping by. Next up for me is the chicken pot pie. My husband wrote a review about the lack of respect from workers towards customers in another language (Spanish), and I must say it was awful.\nFood wasn\u2019t terrible, although extremely expensive. Been here twice now while breezing through town traveling.  Delicious breakfast served in awesome diner-y atmosphere.  Fast and delicious.  We had a steak and cheese omelet and meat and eggs.  Good coffee with refills.  I love that the customers have a great mix of locals along with a handful of tourists.  I\u2019ve only been here for breakfast but the menu looks really good with lots of variety for lunch.  Authentically diner experienced served with no frills \u2014but you don\u2019t need them when you have a great place like Max\u2019s. Excellent local and non-touristic deli in the heart of Boston. You can order at the counter and choose from a large variety of breakfasts, sandwiches and salads. I ordered a Miami Cuban which was freshly made and tasted fantastic. Highly recommended. Service was so bad, with the girls on the sandwich line clearly not caring for the customers as they spoke badly about them in Spanish (I\u2019m Hispanic).\nNever returning. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Easy to find and worthwhile stop. Interesting variety of sandwiches and good eats. Decent sandwiches. Decent price. Same as any other Subway Friendly fast service, convenient location, good food. Great option for a quick lunch on the go. Blown away by the service.  I came to the entrance on high street.  I walked every which way trying to find an accessible way in, but I couldn\u2019t find one.\n\nI placed an order for pick up, and called the cafe counter.  It rang and rang, and I was afraid no one would answer.\n\nApparently this one lovely lady was working alone, but she did finally answer.\n\nI explained that I couldn\u2019t figure out how to get in but wanted to order.  She didn\u2019t argue.  She didn\u2019t even sound frustrated.  She asked my name and what I ordered and assured me that someone would bring it down the stairs for me.\n\nI waited at the tables out front, and someone did!\n\nShe said it wasn\u2019t a problem, but did tell me where there is a ramp, for next time.  She even offered to refill my drink if I needed (it being a very hot day).  \u201cJust wave.  I\u2019ll notice.\u201d  She said.\n\nI wish I had asked for her name, but she did say she\u2019s the only one working the front today, so hopefully someone will know who she is so she can know how grateful I am!  Employee of the month right there!\n\nAlso, the seating here is such a gift!  Right across from the ocean!  The breeze is amazing.  There are umbrellas over the tables.  It\u2019s really restful (other than the motorcycles, but that\u2019s not something Panera can control).\n\nBeing a sip club member was one of\nThe best decisions I made this summer.   And look at this adorable tiny sandwich!!!!  I ordered a half sandwich, and this is what I got.  Love it! Nicest staff, great location, freshest coffee and pastries -- best Panera in the city. Across from the Boston Harbor arch, you get great views. Shout-out to Rashida and the rest of her wonderful staff -- always greet you with a smile and makes you feel at home. Their light roast coffee has no equal! Stopped in to use a gc.  It was rejected.  Curiously so we're two other people using gift cards.  So I presume it was either their system was down, etc. I mean what are the chances that three. People have expired cards etc.. also, they have egg sandwiches on the menu but they only serve breakfast until noon ...but no where on the menu board is there any mention of this time limit.   Not at all impressed with the level of service Panera bread has good selection of sandwiches, salads and coffees on the screen but upon ordering it the experience was completely different. The machine were you order food and coffee gives you the option to chose the coffee but when you get at the coffee station you see a paper reads enjoy freshness of our coffee before 2pm, since I was there at 3:30 I paid for a coffee they finished so I have had to go for another option, the coffee was cold and has no flavor!\nThe kids meal was okay-ish despite being a bit small potion for a child. The pastry was okay too with a hint of lemon Spacious store with so many seating area options.\n\nGood and quick service.\n\nTypical taste and menu. Average pricing and portions. I used to like the dunkin but it's no good now. If you see an old, miserable bag named patrice just know you're orders gonna take forever if you even get it. We were in there yesterday morning, a Thursday and the young woman with the headscarf was so incredibly sweet. She went out of her way to be so kind to my kids and she was probably the friendliest food service worker I've ever come across. It's hard to find good, kind people but she is it. She was so happy and helpful and truly made a huge effort to take care of us. 10/10 she is amazing. I wish I had gotten her name but she was a young woman working Thursday morning and she deserves praise. Thank you! P.s. the food was also great! Horrible customer service especially on Christmas Eve. Could got a nice tip for each of yall . Other Dunkins go above and beyond Would not recommend. Guy took out bagel from some white bag and other bagels are there but he specifically took from bag i guess it was for someone else but nobody took that order. He reheated that again and put it into same white bag and gave it to me. Why would you do that?\nOn top of it, all this took 35+ minutes just for bagel. First I have to tell the guy 3 times my coffee order\nSecond no seasoning on the avocado toaste\n3rd one guy dumps his hand in the ice machine to get my cup of ice for coffee\n4th the milks (all of them) are sitting out in dunkin cups\nWe're the only ones in here and they seem overwhelmed and there's 4 employees\nAbsolutely no patience but what do you have to do? You're working which includes customers...\nI'll try another location before ever coming back here We stopped in for an appetizer and some beverages. Our Bartender was very attentive. The calamari was just okay. We would go back and try something else. The atmosphere was elegant chic and the bathrooms were well kept. Not worth coming. The service was good; however, the food was not! No one in my group liked their orders nor ate more than 25%. We ended up leaving to go anywhere else. No flavor, very bland. My dish\u2019s pasta was hard and chewy. It tasted like eating a garden hose. It was served with an ICE COLD Burrata. That should be served after a 5 second steam bath, not with ice flakes. Overpriced! Nighttime here is the right time. We enjoyed a few apps and drinks. Top tier service and the ambience had romantic flair to it in my opinion. Super clean ladies room. We stopped by Nebo to pick up some pizza and salad for dinner tonight. The restaurant is beautiful inside, and they have a great outdoor dining setup as well. The service at the bar was excellent, and the pizza and salad served tonight were pretty good. If you're staying in the area, Nebo makes for a nice option. The bartender was extremely rude to me. As a brown woman, I\u2019ve never been that comfortable around the bartender but it\u2019s a convenient spot for me to treat myself to pasta and wine as I wait for Amtrak when I\u2019m traveling because it\u2019s so close to South Station. The bartender has always been kind of cold, but yesterday he blatantly ignored me and didn\u2019t even ask how I was feeling after I almost choked on my pasta. Even a customer next to me noticed the rudeness. Idk if it\u2019s rooted in some form of discriminatory sentiment or if it\u2019s just basic rudeness, but I tip well and have spent a good amount of money there. No customer deserves to be treated that way, and I will definitely not ever be going back. The service is welcoming and quick. I come twice a week for a healthy breakfast, a nice place to sit and eat before starting my day. The music is too loud, especially for the morning. The tall guy with dark hair has great customer service. I forgot his name, Nico? Sorry! Great job. I order mobile pickup from this location every day I go into work. one or more items from my order have been missing 7 times this year (will be updating as it happens more).\n\nI have to get to work on time, that's why I schedule my order. when I show up, my order should be ready.\n\nupdate! just received what tasted like spoiled milk in my chai latte yesterday. will be trying other Dunkin locations for my morning commute from now on. For the past few days the iced coffee has been tasting very weird my coworkers and I aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s the cream that\u2019s expired or the syrup (Cs,Hz) I think it\u2019s the cream that\u2019s expired. We even went to the other Dunkin nearby & it tasted much better.overall the employees are very nice. Food is standard, but the service is so slow. I've had to wait over 15 minutes even ordering ahead on the app, and it's still never ready by the time I get there. It's really frustrating and today, after waiting over 20 minutes, I will not be ordering or going to this location again. The coffee is also never consistent. Ambiance: Homey and lively\nParking: It is difficult to find street parking in this area. It is very close to South Station in Downtown Boston.\nPricing: Cheap.\nFood (flavors): Scrambled eggs are always cooked to perfection with the perfect ratio of cheese to egg. I love the home fries which are never too hard or too soft. They don't use any special seasoning on the home fries but they still taste good. The whole wheat toast with butter is also super good; my toast is never burnt or dry. They always put the perfect amount of butter on it.\nPortion size: Medium\nDrinks: None\n\nNote: At some point, I'd go every week and the woman in charge would remember my order without me having to actually order. It was so sweet. They have great customer service. Great little local sandwich shop right near South Station.  Great for a grab and go sandwich or a brief sit down on the way to Amtrak.  My wife and I got the Bostonian sandwich, half light rye, half dark rye.  Turkey, ham, salami with Cole slaw and all the standard veggies.   Good deli pickles too.  A little under $12 per person after tax. Trash, the lady at the front desk is always miserable and acts like a Karen (when you try to call ahead you get hung up on). I\u2019ve ordered the same sandwich several times and have gotten several different prices for the same thing. Nothing is consistent here.. Perhaps the FDA would like to give them a visit I have passed this place for months and thought - \"I should stop in here.\" - -  Well, today I DID! - - and I was not disappointed.  Since it was lunch time I chose the grilled chicken and Broccoli.  VERY TASTY - - and nicely seasoned.  I shall return. The best breakfast options for good prices, right next to the train station!  Highly recommend the bacon egg and cheese and home fries.  They also do a nice grilled muffin! Super friendly staff, never long lines.  $5 minimum for cards but you basically get the closest thing to a home cooked meal. If you\u2019re looking for a yummy lunch option that tastes fresh and healthy, this is the place to come! They have bowls and pitas but you can also build your own. My only complaint with this location is that it lacks seating, so a table can be hard to come by during peak times. I had accidentally left my keys at CAVA the night before and only realized it the next morning. Thankfully, Louise (hope I\u2019m spelling that right!) was incredibly helpful\u2014she picked up the call right away and made sure my keys were safe and ready for pickup. Her kindness and professionalism truly saved my morning! On top of that, the food was delicious as always. Huge thanks to the team at CAVA and especially to Louise for the amazing service. Definitely 5 stars! Thanks Jesus for great service. I wanted to update with a picture. Salad is delicious! If Sweetgreen and Committee had a baby, it would be Cava. I loved how I got to customize my bowl with all of the things I wanted at a very reasonable price. The dressings and toppings I had were fresh and I consumed the whole thing for a filling meal. I definitely rank this highly among other bowl/salad places! Food and service were awesome. Everything was clean and the line was fast. Jesus took care of us in the line and always attentive to the items we were selecting. This is a fantastic spot for a quick and easy grab-and-go lunch. The menu is extensive, so there\u2019s something for everyone, and the option to call ahead makes ordering a breeze. The pickup process is smooth and efficient, perfect for a busy day.\n\nThey use top-quality ingredients, which really stand out in every bite. We tried the Goodfellas and the Sonny\u2014both were excellent. The chicken in the Sonny was incredibly fresh and generously portioned, while the prosciutto on the Goodfella was sliced to order, adding to the sandwich\u2019s rich flavor. Plus, the roll was perfectly fresh, making the whole experience even better.\n\nHighly recommend giving this place a try! Finally!! A sandwich shop worth the money.   This place knows flavors and textures.   Crispy panini pressed bread with flavorful insides.   I had the chicken pesto, and my husband the vegetable Tuscan.   Both incredibly flavorful,  not too salty...just right.  We will be back for sure! I loveeeee this place!! The staff are always polite and everyone working there likes to work there, so their customer service is top notch!!.. their subs are delicious!! but my soft spot is most definitely their brownies!! Rosie, John and the rest of the family are the sweetest people in the world!! When you visit boston make sure you stop by and eat!! enjoy!! Sooo delicious and the staff were fast and friendly. Eggplant was hot and crispy. The honey mustard was perfectly balanced. This is easily the best sandwich bread I\u2019ve ever had: soft, slightly chewy, airy, never soggy. I would eat here every single day if it wasn\u2019t $15/sandwich. This place is very popular but I was able to get in and out in 10 minutes. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve never tried out Figaro\u2019s in my four years here. I tried the two timer, and I\u2019m really hard-pressed to say if there\u2019s a better sandwich. The two timer is like a combination between ground beef and steak with melted cheese and onions.\n\nThis is a quintessential Bostonian sandwich shop. Service is top-notch. I mean here\u2019s a thing - the line went out the door. any other place you\u2019re probably looking at like 30 minutes. End of the line to getting my order was like seven minutes. I feel like I was treated like family and didn\u2019t even know any of these people.\n\nI will be back next week. If you order in the morning you may have your order missed or partially done. Most of the time it\u2019s fine though. Nothing too different from your normal Dunkin it\u2019s just very busy. If you don\u2019t go during rush hours though it\u2019s pretty good. The black cashier with the glasses attitude is atrocious!!! First off she can\u2019t count then she threw money in my hand!!! If you don\u2019t want to work DON\u2019T! This is becoming a pattern in Boston Ghetto Ghetto Ghetto. I ordered a bagel toasted with butter and they gave me a cold toasted bagle with butter that  I had to put on myself. The service is horrible and they didn't give me any sugar or vanilla flavoring in my coffee  the first time when I asked for it to be light and sweet. 6.50 for medium drink, the guy was rude and would not go again, and my drink barely had any flavor Beware, this store scams and took balance from your dunkin account!!!\nOn Aug 12, 2023, I purchased a cup of coffee at the store. A few days later, I found out that my dunkin account balance is zeroed by the store. Upon reaching out to dunkin customer service, I was told at the exact same time of my dunkin purchase, there is a second transaction by the store on my account that zeroed my account.\nUpon reaching the store many times, the store still could not offer an explanation.\nBeware, if you have purchased at this store, check your account, this store may be taking money away from you!!! They have pre-sliced bagels in a bin. Today I got half a cinnamon raison and half of a sesame bagel. Small but very nice corner Dunkin that\u2019s good for a quick pickup. Asked for hot coffee three times and they made an iced coffee The two chinese staff are so lovely and flexible, don\u2019t know why they hire this \u201c no feeling face \u201c blond , anyway love it here This place is super busy. But they still keep.top quality of services, accurate order and great customer experience. I very appreciated their work. I work around and buy their coffee all the time.I don't know if I am able to survive my working days without them :) Avoid this one. Two weeks ago, I waited 20 mins for my order and watched a woman walk out with it. Staff wouldn't even listen. Went again today, placed an online order and 30 minutes later they were telling me to double check where I ordered it. 1 Summer Street. I even showed the order to confirm. They said nothing and I walked away again with no order. I get that they're busy, but there's definitely something wrong with this place during the morning rush. It's fine in the afternoon, but I'm already out $10 here so they're never getting my business again. I went to buy coffee and breakfast today like 10 min ago .I saw staff smoking outside of Dunkin\u2019 and he can back to work with out washing hand and I told him please wash your hand before you pick up my pastry.he show me blue wipe towel and argue with me I wash my hand  with towel.according to Massachusetts law every employee must wash their hand before came to work.and last I said thank you but he clap me as I don\u2019t take your thank so rude and he was shift leader.Jin was nice and she make my coffee and give me my pastry.I used to go every day now no more.. This is the worst Dunkin\u2019 Donuts I\u2019ve ever been to.  They have two lines, one is \u201cexpress\u201d (coffee only).  This system doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating.\n\nThey even manage to mess up orders that I make from the app.  They always seem understaffed.\n\nDo yourself a favor, save time by going to a different Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.  Several locations are only a few blocks away. Worst run Dunkin\u2019s I\u2019ve ever been to. Long wait for food when it was nearly empty. My wrap was cold in the middle, orders came out in random order, and half of my order was forgotten. Do not go here. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I WENT TO THE DUNKIN DONUTS ON SUMMER STREET IN ARLINGTON 2NIGHT AND BECAUSE OF THE POWER GOING OUT I STUCK BY AND AGAIN AFTER THE POWER CAME ON BOUT 6/8 MINUTES LATER IT WENT OUT SO I STAYED 4 A BIT AND AGAIN WHEN I LEFT IT WAS STILL CHILLING OUT A BIT AND I HAVE 2 GREAT FRIENDS WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR MY WIFE AND I AND AGAIN WHO'S DONE \u2705 THE BEST JOB EVER AND AGAIN WHEN I GO THERE EITHER IN THE MORNING OR AT NIGHT I HAVE FRIENDS WHO'S GOING 2 BE THERE FOR ME AND MY WIFE AND AGAIN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE DOING THE ON LINE ORDERING THERE ALWAYS GOING 2 BE THERE NO MATTER WHAT AND THAT'S WHY I PRETTY MUCH 1 EITHER GO AND THEN AGAIN PICK UP MY ON LINE ORDERS OR I JUST GET MY COFFEE \u2615 ORDER AT NIGHT \ud83d\ude42 AND AGAIN I HAVE FRIENDS WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR ME AND AGAIN EVERYONE ELSE AS WELL I LOVE IT THERE AND AGAIN NOTHING ELSE IS AND AGAIN WILL EVER AGAIN CHANGE PERIOD Disappointed.No body takes responsibility .They sent the wrong order l. I cant eat pork and they send it with bacon by mistake . couldn\u2019t contact anyone to solve the issue. They work with Doordash and doordash says they can refund just $6 in 12 days. Wendy\u2019s doesn\u2019t even respond. After almost being mauled outside this Wendy\u2019s for spare change and asked 10X for money. The inside of this Wendy\u2019s is no better! I would rather eat off the subway floor instead of here! Absolutely nasty. Do not recommend this place to your worst enemy. The homeless people even follow you inside and ask for money! HOW ABOUT THAT for service! First time at Wendy's. We are from the UK and have obviously heard about Wendy's - it's definitely better than McDonald's but the one we went to in Boston was a bit ran down. The service was lovely, very polite, and the food was canny but didn't amaze me. Best fast food restaurant of all hands down. Great burgers, chili, baked potato, and the classic Frosty. Prices are reasonable. The service was fast and friendly. Good location, but the atmosphere is average. I had an appointment at 10 o'clock and it was 9:20, I went for a quick breakfast. When I made it there, the personnel spent like 10 minutes chatting with the guy in front of me. When my turn finally came, they took my order and didn't even took the time to activate the dataphone so I took even longer to pay. Of course, my order took the usual time but when I received it and exited the restaurant, I realized they had given me the wrong order, I went back and wasted even mooore time waiting for my order to be ready. Truly an inneficient service. Those sausage muffins were fire, though. if you go to this McDonald's don't use the app. I ordered & paid on McDonald's app for pick up while traveling through boston on greyhound bus then employees said I had to pay again before receiving my order. Very poor customer service. No, seating. Table to stand & eat at was dirty. Don't think I would go to this McDonald's again. On a positive note fries were hot & fresh \ud83c\udf5f. 3 Stars mostly because food quality was actually good. WORST MCDONALD'S EVER. Very rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional team working the registers! The manager even slammed the scanner on the counter when I had to place another order for a sundae cone with my QR code! The manager couldn't care less to check whether your coupon/deal applied to your order or not! They are also very stingy with nugget sauces and make you feel interrogated for asking! I asked for BBQ sauce when I saw I only had ketchup packets for my chicken nugget meals and the cashier said the sauces were only for nuggets which I showed her I ordered! She and the manager then spoke in Spanish in front of me as if I was being questioned for asking for BBQ sauce! Can't I have ketchup for my fries and BBQ sauce for my nuggets??? It is also VERY BASIC customer service to repeat the order to the customer to ensure everything is right! They also just filled my large fries halfway, to add to it, there is some cross-contamination going on as there were Oreo crumbs in my fries. Looks like I am not the only one with the same issues with this branch. How is it that corporate hasn't retrained these employees on customer service fundamentals? Disgusting in all aspects! Taking into consideration it's a busy location the lack of service is still mind boggling. They stand in the kitchen speaking a foreign language and completely I mean look at you and turn their head to continue talking ignore you . Waited 11 minutes at register then they come after  they were done talking no food in hands while talking so not working hard with an attitude to take order. The absolute worst customer service in a McDonald's I've ever seen They charge top dollar and do not mix the McFlurrys. I also got a $5 order of fries right before they closed and they were not hot. Granted it was right before they closed so it\u2019s understandable. But they couldn\u2019t return the money for the non-hot fries so I had to take the loss and walk away as a dissatisfied customer. $5 wasted. Nice people who work there though. They just look at you crazy when something needs correction. Otherwise it\u2019s a regular Mickey D\u2019s. Employees shouldn't be blaming customers that their equipment is broken. They should also learn to listen & STOP giving the wrong order when you get the same thing every day & they still screw it up. If there was another option I would do that but sadly it'd this or nothing & nothing is sounding better. We liked the seafood with crunchy noodles, it was great and a huge portion as pictured. The scallion dumplings for dim sum weren\u2019t worth it. The pork buns were! Delicious. And then I got the sesame balls which I thought were delicious as well. Also good spot where we weren\u2019t rushed at all and given tea to chat with I've tried several Dim Sum places, and I think Hei La Moon is the best. Their shrimp dim sum is amazing\u2014any kind! The braised pork dim sum is also fantastic. However, many of the dishes have a strong Chinese spice aroma, which might not be to everyone's taste if you're not used to these scents. On weekends, you can choose your dim sum from carts, which I find very easy and intuitive.\n\nOne thing to note is that most of the employees don\u2019t speak English. I was able to use a few simple Chinese words, which helped occasionally, so don't expect much in terms of friendly service. You can simply order dishes as you see them, without needing an explanation.\n\nIt gets very crowded on weekends, so try to avoid peak times between 11:00 am and 1:00 pm. If you go around these times, you might have to wait 30 minutes to an hour. My go-to dimsum spot in Boston Chinatown. Love the carts that come by during the afternoon with a variety of dimsum choices.\n\nI love the pan fried buns, steamed bbq pork buns, and zongzis are just my comfort food \ud83e\udd5f. The wonton egg noodle soup \ud83c\udf5c is really good with some soy sauce (don't know if that's a thing but it's a personal choice lol).\n\nAll the dim sum are great but the pu pu platter was meh \ud83c\udf62\ud83c\udf57 We used to eat at Hei La Moon many years ago and while visiting Boston this restaurant was on our \u2018must eat\u2019 list. Our opinion is that the new location is much better than the old one, more natural light and it\u2019s cleaner. The food was amazing, better than we remember. We got about 10 dim sum/ appetizers (maybe too much for 3 people) and they were all delicious. My favorite was the egg yolk bun, the flavor is strong and so pleasant. The chive dumplings were very good too. We liked every single dish and appreciated the fact that the taste was different, no 2 dishes had the same spice or taste. Nothing was greasy or cold, everything was perfect. I\u2019m not sure why this place is barely on the cusp of 4 stars. I had a great experience here and the service was fast as well as accommodating. I think it can be hard if you don\u2019t have a Chinese friend with you, but it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s impossible. They have a large variety of dishes and their dim sum is amazing. I loved their fried taro and the pork buns.\n\nI think your experience will really depend on if you get the dishes that match with your palate. Sometimes a good match is more important than popularity or hype and it\u2019s important not to judge a place just because a flavor is not to your liking. If you are looking for dim sum in Chinatown, I would highly recommend. You get a large amount of food for the amount you spend, especially if you bring friends and split. In my opinion, it\u2019s very worth! In fact I was so distracted by the food I forgot to take more pictures lol Decided to try this place on our last day in Boston for the rolls.  We arrived around 3pm and the place was half full which made it easy to find a seat.  There is seating inside (main building and adjacent rooms) and outdoor patio seating.  We ordered the large Lobster Roll w/Mayo, large Crab Roll, and a Medium Clam Chowder which came to $101 w/ tip.  Both rolls were filled to the brim and delicious. We preferred the Crab over the Lobster (sweeter taste) but would get both again.  Only thing that would make it better is better \u201crolls\u201d - they use rolls which have a crust which were tough at the ends, instead of a softer, brioche-like bread which I prefer. Clam chowder was just so-so and I would try a different soup next time.\nI\u2019d still recommend stopping by if you are in the area and looking for a tasty meal!\nI also wanted to acknowledge the owner\u2019s reply to all the Google reviews - good and bad.  I appreciate that they truly care what people think! Stopped by James Hook & Co. on my last day in Boston after a local recommended it\u2014what a solid way to end the trip!\n\nThe place has a laid-back, coastal vibe that really makes you feel like you\u2019re right by the ocean (which you basically are). There\u2019s even a tank of live lobsters up front, which adds to the charm. Ordering was simple: walk up, place your order, get a number, and wait for them to call it out.\n\nI went all in and ordered a large lobster roll with mayo, shrimp cocktail, and a cup of New England clam chowder. The lobster roll was loaded with fresh, plump lobster meat. Super fresh\u2014just wish it had a touch more seasoning to really make it pop. The clam chowder was rich, hearty, and comforting. Perfectly satisfying. And the shrimp cocktail? Excellent. The shrimp were big, juicy, and chilled just right.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a great casual spot for classic New England seafood. Definitely worth checking out if you\u2019re in town and want something unfussy but delicious. Atmosphere of a pub/casual restaurant. I appreciate and respect the vibe. I ordered a large lobster roll with mayo, which is pricey according to me and my standards, but I guess that\u2019s what to expect with seafood. Also the toilets outside in a cabin is a big no for me. My brother and his family surprised my husband with a lobster dinner complete with 2 live lobsters and clam chowder for his birthday. After moving from South of Boston down to the Mobile Alabama area, one sure does miss New England lobster, stuffed clam quahogs and clam chowder let me tell you! I quickly and excitedly set the dinner table and we had a feast! We will enjoy the fantastic sensation of this incredible gift for all time. Stopped in for lunch on way to Boston Logan. Spent more time looking for a place to park than I did dining, so be prepared. Place was packed for lunch, so good indication of great food. Counter service and ordered large lobster roll with butter. Very fast and friendly service. Lobster roll was awesome, packed with full of beautiful lobster. Highly recommend if you are in the area! We love the Chicken!  Nashville Hot is so juicy and tender.   Fries are crispy.   Onion rings were delicious.   We really couldn't go wrong with anything we ordered.   Another bonus is the dog friendly patio with water dishes for my dad's pup! Parking is plentiful with warm friendly service. If you love the comfort of a down home farm to table atmosphere \u2014 in the middle of a cornfield \u2014this may be your place. Prices are reasonable with a menu full of creative options. The boasted  drumstick and wing was crispy and well seasoned. The house baked beans were exceptional as well as the deviled eggs which were my favorite. Stop in and give them a try even if you have to wait fifteen minutes due to a slamming crowd! I've always had good food here with one exception, perhaps my own fault. Ordered online. Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and gravy as a side and a side of gravy to dunk the chicken in. I expected chicken gravy and got cream gravy. I didn't see any specific mention of what style was included but I don't usually see cream gravy served with mashed potato and assumed it would be chicken gravy. That said, everything but the mashed potatoes has been wonderful. It's been a long time since this order but they were under seasoned and kinda brown. I haven't had them since. My experience today with the fish and chips was delightful! Not too crazy tartar sauce, properly battered fish, well seasoned fries, tasty coleslaw, and a proper wedge of lemon to zest things up if you desire. Fast, hot, and tasty! Wow!  Never been here before but I will definitely be back!!!  Great selection of beer, drinks, and food.  And the food was awesome!!!! Can't have about it enough. Excellent food, fun atmosphere- this place is a gem!\nThe food was absolutely delicious, I can\u2019t wait to go back and try more dishes.\nI love the decor and vibes of this place. Went for a quick breakfast and the food look as it was just thrown together and this was after I was handed the increase order. The menu doesn\u2019t specify how many of each item come with the order the Nash has brown are just two frozen has patties with some seasoning pulled up on some side. The hash brown were not tossed and only 2 came with the order for close to over $5 this place needs to work on putting a little more effort into the creation of the order and be transparent with the # of items include in sides and Meals Solid counter. I appreciate the takeout/cafeteria style of 99 High St and Wheelhouse makes a good, large burger. Nice variety of options and the papas locas fries were delicious. I need to go back and try the shakes sometime Excellent burger spot! The meat is juicy, the fries are crisp, and the Peanut-butter Cup Milk shake is delicious smoothness. If you\u2019re looking to satisfy your blood thirst cravings, Wheelhouse Boston will do the trick. The burger was great. The fries and onion rings were decent. It\u2019s really a side for 2 people not 1. Good, quick service and great food. The breakfast fried rice with a side order of hash browns was filling and delicious. Now I have to go back and try a breakfast sandwich and one of the cheeseburgers. Definitely recommend for a quick breakfast. Came here with a group of 3 and\n\nGood:\n- Loved the uniqueness of the baked dishes, I got a tom yum spaghetti and the texture was great of the noodles and the seafood\n- The french toast was so tasty too! Not too sweet but the perfect amount of flakiness\n- The popcorn chicken was very tender and crunchy\n- The cucumber was refreshing!\n- Nice to catch up with people, very simple place and good vibes\n- Super cute bear that you can add to any drink! Not just the ones with it in it\n\nBad:\n- Super long wait time, about 30 min for a group of 6 and also 30 min to get our food after ordering\n\nOverall would come here again for the super tasty asian food! Food was great. Service was fantastic. Will come back to try other dishes. The only problem was the chopped chicken has too many cracked bones that kept jabbing our mouths. Was not nice when the cracked bones hit my teeth. It's a excellent place to relax and looking for something Asian food around. Japanese original food, excellent service, accessible price, don't try to listen to music practically it's the same music but if you looking for something place to talk with your friends just chilling this is really good place just for talk and take sometimes different. Honestly it is really good food. Amazing Hong Kong style Cafe!!! I really like their sizzling steak they had as well as the baked spaghetti they also have! Service was quick and easy as well as ordering. I really like the ambiance with the different colors and even the wood paneling as well as their signature dog hanging on the wall! They also have Thai milk, tea and Hong Kong style milk tea with very special shaped ice in the form of a bear and dog! Our big regret is that we haven't eaten here earlier.   Stopped in for dinner and had some great and authentic food.   The portion size is huge for the price and everything we had was excellent!\n\nI don't have the menu names but we had the Beef hand pulled noodles, chicken in a pot, curry chicken, chicken feet, and shrimp fried rice.  Bonus for the delicious thai tea and milk tea with the animals (which were frozen ice - but fun).\n\nStaff was friendly and efficient, and we were seated quickly.   Even the music selection was excellent.   Highly recommended! Was a decent place to grab lunch but prices have skyrocketed while portion size has diminished dramatically. Stopped for breakfast. I would equate it to what you\u2019d get at your local gas station except with a higher price tag. Certainly not worth the money but people in that building pay the prices out of mere convenience. It was very good sandwiches.  Fresh and lots of choices.  Very nice owner.  She was helpful with ideas for our visit to Boston. Had the seafood salad wrap w/ mixed greens and tomato. Forgot to take a pic. It was that good! This place is awesome!  They're catered a lunch for my company and the sandwiches were the best I've had in Boston. I like this place: it\u2019s close to my work and always has fresh foods. Amazing pastries and yogurts. Very good single origin coffee, nice combo of flavors. All the made-to-order items are delightful. Sometimes the prepared items sit out for a little to long, but the flavor profile of all their food is spot on. The staff at every location I've been to, especially the S. Station location and the one just up from it in the Financial District is very friendly and helpful. The team at this Pret, as well as the South Station location, is amazing. They are ALWAYS smiling, attentive and kind. I can't say enough about all of the individuals that work at these locations. Their dedication to customer service is so much appreciated. Thank you all for making my day every time I stop by! Very friendly staff! Today, it was a very hot day at p.m, I went in and ordered a small iced black tea and this very friendly staff treated me very very well. I\u2019m thrilled by their customer service in such an urban place like boston and I hope to visit again! Go-to quick lunch sandwiches. I've liked everything I've ordered, either cold or hot. Food is fresh, portioned well, and checkout is fast and easy (major points for tap-and-pay). Wife (not a Bostonian): \"What about this place, Legal Seafoods? It looks nice.\"\n\nMe: \"Well, it used to be great, kinda went downhill, IMHO. I think of it as the Fridays of seafood.\"\n\nMe: (reading wife's disappointment) \"Let's give it a try.\"\n\nWe arrive, and eventually, someone comes to greet and seat us. Dread sinks in right away when I see the duct taped seat, with dangling duct tape, which I'll be sitting on. It then takes 10 minutes before the server arrives (slow night, no reason for it.) \"Sorry no sushi or cerviche tonight, no sushi chef. We order clam chowder. Wife orders fish tacos, and I order a salad. Both the tacos and salad are bland. We finish quick, and then waited another 10 minutes before we saw the server again. I asked for the check, and we settled and left. That confirmed what I already knew about this sad tale of a restaurant. Now my wife understands. I wish it hadn't cost me $97.\n\nThe service could have made up for the bad food, but it didn't. Lackluster all around. Had I not been tired from an all-day flight, I would have sought out the manager. Yet from what I could tell, the staff was on its own, and the manager just wouldn't have cared, IMHO. Avoid.\n\nPS - server was a friendly guy. It may be that he had no support. Dunno.\n\nPPS - crew of 3 servers camped out in the next booth, on phones, rolling cutlery, and napkins. We booked a table for Friday night and had a lovely meal.\nWe had a main meal each and shared a dessert.\nThe seafood was really tasty and I was impressed with how many scallops you got in that dish.\nMy husband really liked his seafood too.\nThe key lime pie was also good.\nWould recommend the chain and return. Good food and friendly staff. The free bread rolls for the table can even be gluten free which is super cool. The fish is fresh and the majority of the menu is gluten free with a dedicated fryer. The items are clearly indicated. The fish and chips was lightly battered and crispy, tartar sauce is good. A local friend tells me this used to be a great eatery that became a chain. We all (6 people) loved our seafood, desserts and service. The interior could be more interesting, welcoming, cozy or contemporary - so what? This is our first time in Boston. Search many reviews and want give it a try.  We had lobster roll which is good- fresh, sweet chunks of lobster meat, lightly dressed in just enough mayo to enhance the natural flavor without overpowering it. The toasted, buttery bun adds a satisfying crunch, and the portion is generous. It\u2019s simple, traditional, and exactly what I expect.\n\nMy son is not into seafood, so he ordered filet mignon steak which is a pleasant surprise. While seafood is the star at Legal, they prepare a well-executed steak\u2014tender, flavorful, and cooked to the requested temperature.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re in Boston looking for an authentic lobster roll, Legal Sea Foods is a solid choice. And if someone in your party isn\u2019t into seafood, the filet mignon is a worthy alternative. Great food, good service, and a classic Boston dining experience. Anytime there\u2019s a suggestion to go to Trade, the answer is automatically an \u201cabsolutely.\u201d This is definitely a top 10 restaurant in Boston, the definition of a 5 star restaurant that nails it every time we\u2019ve been with their attentive service, their stellar atmosphere, and their perfect food. I\u2019m surprised (and grateful) that this place isn\u2019t being stormed or constantly overbooked.\n\nBefore we get to the food, it needs to be mentioned how well this place is managed by John and how attentive everyone is. The staff makes an effort to take care of you. The ambiance of the restaurant is also elegant and charming.\n\nEach time I went, we ordered a lot of food, so we\u2019ve covered most of the menu, everything has always been great, but here is my recommendations:\n\nShrimp and Garlic - this is a must, no negotiations, order it. I\u2019ve had this dish in other places, Trade takes the crown on this one. Use the bread that comes with it to dip it in the sauce.\n\nWhen you order the Fried Cauliflower, use some of the bread that comes with the Shrimp and Garlic (since you\u2019re definitely going to order it) and dip it in the sauce of the Cauliflower.\n\nFor the main, either the Herb Crusted Lamb Chops or Whole Roasted Branzino. It all depends if you\u2019re in the mood for seafood or meat, both or great options.\n\nDo not dare to skip on dessert and go straight for the Burnt Orange Phyllo Bread Pudding.\n\nHighly recommend this restaurant, will continue to come again and again. The baklava is creative!! I've never tasted a baklava like this before. The mushroom pizzette is my favorite, the fig on it makes it more special. The environment and service are all perfect! The midday menu doesn't contain many dishes so I'd definitely dine again during dinner time. We were a large party and we were visiting this place for the first time. We were celebrating one of our friend's birthday so people were in all fun moods. We ordered a lot of food, and it took us time to decide and order. The server was a little upset about that, and it showed from his behavior when he took our order. He wasn't responding to us, and it felt like he was annoyed. I understand the frustration, but when there is a large party, it takes time to finalize the order.\n\nThe food here was delicious. We repeated so many dishes, and I think eventually after seeing that the server was okay.\nTheir eggplant dish was our favorite, baked feta phyllo was also really good.\n\nThey don't allow outside cake in the restaurant, so if you plan to cake a cut in the restaurant, then they don't allow you to do it.\n\nAlthough they were kind to give us disposable spoons so we could cut the cake outside and enjoy it. Had an incredible night at Trade with my husband celebrating our anniversary. We had a 7:15 reservation and our table was ready for us when we got there. From ambiance to food, everything was perfect. Our server was attentive, food was very flavorful, drinks were good and strong, and the place is so beautiful and romantic. We had pita and meze spreads, tuna tartare, whole branzino and vegetable moussaka and we recommend everything. The baklava pistachio wafer is so creative and has a nice presentation too. We'll definitely come back! We recently celebrated my best friend\u2019s birthday at Trade and it was an unforgettable experience! The hospitality was outstanding, making us feel truly special. The service was amazing and the food was absolutely delicious, adding to a perfect celebration! Highly recommend it! Order a bowl though the app. And portion size is insanely small. I got extra chicken on the bowl, but it was even less than regular portion that i had back in Saco, Maine location. Don\u2019t recommend to go there. This Chipotle DOES NOT scrimp. They are fast and efficient with bowl preparation and the overall process. One critique I can make was that the trash was overfilling. Overall, if you\u2019re hungry for a BITE (and I emphasize this fully) of some (reasonably/awesomely portioned) bowl/burrito/whatever your heart desires, then I recommend this location. Solid chipotle, it had good portion sizes.  The staff had some trouble understanding english which seemed to frustrate some customers but i had no issues-  they were pretty efficient too.\n\nThe seating upstairs is nice, and theres an average amount of space despite the small entry area They closed my lid before I finished. My bowl was mad dry and the  rice was so plain and crunchy and dry. Totally ruined my day. So looking forward to a good chipotle bowl during work and I am now so disappointed. My first bad Chipotle bowl. First time being to chipotle. The server was kind and helpful giving information about the food and kindly gave me a handle bag for my food when I asked. The wrapping of the burrito could've been a little better but the food was great with a good amount of spice and flavor, worth the money. Ordered on DoorDash and what showed up was completely wrong. Ordered 3 sandwiches and a coffee and got an orange juice, one sandwich and a muffin. I have tried calling the store 5 times and no one will pick up. Completely dissatisfied with the service. This was not DoorDash\u2019s fault!!!! Want my money back! Used to come here a lot, but service and quality has been going downhill. This bagel was completely smashed, not cut in half, and toasted which I did not want. Texture of the bagel was completely ruined. It took about 20 min to order and receive a simple bagel with cream cheese. Staff is totally disorganized with cashier leaving for about 10 minutes to start prep work. Go to kupels in Brookline instead, and you will be very happy. The bagels are above average for the region, but the prep needs some work.\n\nWhen the staff adds butter or cream cheese to the bagel, they just cake it on one side and smash it together. This leads to an uneven distribution of spread. In the photo below, I walked for ~10 mins to allow the spread to melt and give a chance to even out and melt before taking the picture. Faulty methodology is evident where one side of the bagel is dripping in butter while the other contains dry spots. Adding spread yourself is challenging when stopping in on a morning commute. The service is also not expedited enough to justify this methodology. I've been here a few times and noticed the method of only applying spread to one side and smashing together is routine and not a once-off.\n\nFor the price point, the expectation would be for staff to apply light spread/butter to both halves. The location is very convenient. I\u2019ve been going to Bruegger\u2019s for 20+ years, always grabbing a bagel after getting off the T and walking to Children\u2019s.\n\nBruegger\u2019s has a huge selection of freshly-made Bagels. The bagels are kettle-boiled. They have every bagel, from sweet to savory. The cream cheese selection is equally impressive.\n\nThe cream cheese is made-in-Vermont. They have every variety and flavor, from sweet to savory. My personal favorite is the Onion and Chive cream cheese. I\u2019m weird, I\u2019ll get it on a Blueberry or Chocolate chip bagel.\n\nIf you are hungry for more than just a bagel, you MUST check out their Signature Breakfast Sandwiches. My personal favorite and go-to is the \u201cFarmhouse\u201d breakfast sandwich.\n\nIt is loaded with serious flavor. Two fresh eggs, ham, cheddar cheese, & bacon are served on a Toasted Cheesy Hash Brown bagel with country-pepper cream cheese. Bursting with flavor and I\u2019m usually full the rest of the day!\n\nIf you\u2019re a lunch person, they do have a solid selection of sandwiches served on a bagel. The dessert menu could certainly use a few more options to choose from! If you\u2019re a fan of coffee and iced coffees, they have you covered. Personally, I\u2019m not a huge coffee person.\n\nI will say Bruegger\u2019s has changed, and not in a good way. The staff are incredibly rude and short. This is commonplace at all their locations. They act inconvenienced that a customer came into the store. These days, I just have it delivered to avoid being treated with an attitude.\n\nI also have noticed the bagels have become smaller in size. Consistency is also an issue, many times the bagels are over cooked or hard. Luckily, that wasn\u2019t the case today!\n\nThe order was made correctly and delivered fresh & hot! If you\u2019re looking for a solid breakfast sandwich on a bagel, Bruegger\u2019s has you covered!\n\nThey could improve by not shrinking the size of the bagels. Furthermore, new employees with a good attitude is needed at all their stores. Painfully slow service and quality has not been great. Many times I have asked and paid for extra cheese only for there to be a regular amount or barely any at all. The egg in my sandwich today had a green tint to it. Be prepared to wait 20+ minutes even if there are only a few people ahead of you because they usually have only one person making all the orders (who doesn\u2019t seem concerned at all with keeping a decent pace and the growing line). Don\u2019t be surprised if people who ordered afterwards get their food before you, which I don\u2019t understand when my order is very minimal and easy :/ I came here after Boston Tea Party for a break from the cold windy weather, but also for a hot cup of coffee and some donuts. This was as good a place as any other Dunkin with good service, well-made coffee and helpful staff. The seating space is plentiful and it\u2019s location is prime. This Dunkin Donuts is on the corner of Congress and High Street. They don't have a public restroom.  They do whip up some good coffee in the morning; a good crew. This Dunkin Donuts is a mess and the board of health needs to be sent over to this location.  They are suppose to open at 6am but for some reason they are always opening late or no one is there.  When they are open you walk in and there is coffee spills every where.  How can this happen when you are the first customer through the door.  the  counters are a mess and people (managers mostly) have early morning attitudes.  If you are not a people person then get out of this profession.  I will not be going to this location again. Understaffed. Employees prioritized 5 online orders in a row instead of helping the long line of customers. Waited 10+ mins at register before being served\n\nAnd the everything bagel is more like a nothing bagel I called today (Thursday 4/5) inquire about the location and time; Jason answered the phone told me the time they closed ; when I asked about location he said to google for directions; I told him I am asking him because I need to know whats near etc; He was rude and could have said where are you located etc and been more customer friendly ; Definitely I wont recommend this place; In my hotel we try to find out if the guest is nearby , new to the city then we can help guide them. Get him some training; He was also cold over the phone. I\u2019m a big fan and usually love the chicken poblano bowl , and it\u2019s my go-to order. Love the taste of it and I it's better than Sweetgreen and Cava.But the Boston Franklin location has been consistently disappointing. I always ask for light dressing, yet my salad still comes completely drenched in sauce, which really ruins the flavor and experience. I\u2019ve also noticed that the amount of crispy chicken is super inconsistent and often very little, which makes me question the promised 50 grams of protein and 650 calories listed on the website. I even tried reaching out on Instagram to give feedback privately but never got a response, and I gave it another shot today hoping things had improved, but again it was just drenched. I\u2019m honestly so disappointed because I really do love this brand and want to keep coming back, but this keeps happening and it\u2019s frustrating. Food:\n1 Cilantro Lime Bowl\t$13.99: This was good and getting the option for vegan feta was wonderful. If you are gluten free get it WITHOUT the added pita chips!!! The lentils, rice, roasted chicken, avocado and pickled onion with corn are lovely, but I wanted a touch more acid, I wanted tomato or a squeeze of lime to top it off. OKAY.\n\n1 Earth Bowl w/ Roasted Chicken\t$13.99:  This one was disappointing. Just okay, like it was too sweet, and too soft. Not enough apple maybe? It could do with pumpkin seeds or walnuts or something added for texture. Maybe go light on the dressing? I also had a weird bite and had to spit it out. An egg shell like something yet again. Maybe because I go there in the middle of them cleaning?  My mouth started itching after eating this and I took 3 Zyrtec. I haven't had great luck trying to eat in MA. PASS ON THIS ONE.\n\nEnvironment:\nIt was wheelchair friendly but it is a long galleyway if you want to watch your order being made. I also thought on a partly cloudy day it was pretty dark in there. It gave dinner vibes for a fast health-food spot, and I did not like that. I also could hear stalk talking and laughing in the kitchen even with the swinging door closed, though I couldn't hear them clearly. Though some staff sought to remedy this and have a trash talking chat at the register loudly, and with music playing in the place, I did not need to hear that. It killed the peaceful vibe.\n\nVERDICT: OKAY. BUILD YOUR OWN SALAD/BOWL INSTEAD. Really great and fresh tasting salads! Everything was very well mixed together and was a quick and easy option for lunch. I tried the honey crispy chicken salad and the chicken pita salad. Chicken pita was definitely better\u2014amazing dressing that had a little spice to it which I loved. The other one was fine too but just a bit boring. I have lunch from JustSalad three times a week, always take-out. The staff, especially Shonda, always takes great care of me. They are polite and fast. My favorite go-to dish is the cilantro lime chicken bowl. Absolutely delicious, every bite tastes like heaven. Great prices, very tasty food and consistent. Shanta Dixon is a star!! I had ordered delivery but never received my food, so I stopped by the store on Franklin St. She was so apologetic and kind, and immediately started taking my order. I had a VERY long list of items for my salad and she was extremely patient and kind as she wrote each one down. She promptly made my food and smiled throughout our interaction. She deserves a raise!! No ifs, ands or buts about it! Absolutely awesome ! They have really good options for base (quinoa, yellow rice and few green) and for proteins. Servers were very nice. You can choose almost 9 sides for your bowl. Their cilantro tahini is the best ! It is little pricey. But Server was very generous with the portion. They were celebrating someones birthday so everyone was served free cake !\n\nI totally recommend this ! One of the tastiest things I have ordered from Noon has to be their loaded pita bread with protein and fries. Remember ordering that a few times and has always hit the spot. Their bowls are also really good as well. Fries tasty as well. As someone who is a big fan of mediterranean food, I highly recommend Noon. Very good quinoa bowl. they just forgot to give the tahini sauce. I wish they gave a bit more hummus and taziki too. Bowls are very customizable. The meat was juicy and flavorful. Delish, natural, fresh and authentic flavor...\nEverything is prepared fresh to order.\n\nTakeout was very easy via grubhub!\n\nReally loved their french fries and tasy falafel.\n\nCan't wait to come here again this summer. I tried the vegan falafel bowl. This is one of the few Mediterranean places that allows customisation. Basically you can have exactly what you want on the bowl. The food was quite tasty and I felt like I had a nice and healthy meal. If there was one reason why I came here the second time was for the concern that the helper had for me; he actually pointed out that Tzatziki wasn't completely vegan as it had yogurt. Not everybody appreciated my vegan diet as much as the Noon helper did. Definitely recommend it!! I\u2019m a big fan of sweetgreen and I got exactly what I was in the mood for. I really loved my kale Caesar with steak. I know the steak may look well done but I PROMISE it\u2019s incredibly tender, juicy, and well seasoned. The tomatoes added a nice freshness and I could just eat those Parmesan cheese crisps all day. They\u2019ve really improved their menu over the years, I must say! Super happy workers! They are very friendly and the food was great. Definitely the best sweetgreen location i\u2019ve ever been to. Got an extra protein today from SweetGreen. Free grasshopper in the salad. LIVE GRASSHOPPER. Come on! Highly recommend ordering ahead at this location. Not just because it\u2019s busy but I found it extremely hard to order with the woman who took my order. Unfortunately, a simple order of the ripple fries took longer than it should have due to english not being her first language and all. I think it would be helpful to put someone on ordering who\u2019s first language is English and can move the line along without having to yell to someone at the other end of the counter or into the kitchen for translation. Also, it should be noted that the woman at the register decided to hand everything to me instead of sliding it across the counter and I ended up dropping the dipping sauce. It just felt very lackluster for such a busy location. Otherwise, the food was good. I tried the Shroomami. It was filling with lots of different ingredients, which added a nice depth of flavor and texture variety. I appreciate that the nutrition is listed on the website, but these bowls are not as healthy as they are marketed to be if you look at the macros, which is my only gripe. However, this is a good catering option for work if you want something slightly healthier for your employees. Originally wanted the spicy tuna burrito but because of a misunderstanding I ended up with the Tuna poke bowl. Y\u2019all\u2026this slapped! The guacamole, tuna and sauce brings so much flavor to the plate I love it.\n\nI frequent here for lunch and in regards to flavor they might not go home with the gold medal but they for sure take it home for how healthy and fresh the food is. You feel great after eating.\n\nMy criticism in regards to flavor; the veggies need a little love that\u2019s all.\n\nShout out to the new kid on staff who put it together, I wish I could remember his name. It was delicious. I like the bowl I made and their tacos were pretty cool as well. This Asian fusion cuisine truly packs some flavor for all to enjoy. Ingredients looked super fresh and things were constantly being grilled and restocked as needed. Lemon grass steak tacos and the teriyaki bowl both were good portion and reasonably priced. Also the seating at this location is extensive. Both floor level and upstairs dining. Really good! Fully gluten free. Felt healthy but had great flavor. Would love to try some other things.\nMarket noodles with shrimp-Very good!\nSteak tacos- Very good!\nChicken tacos- Good! I'm writing this review as I sit here chowing down on a burrito and potstickers (aka dumplings). I'm celiac and my husband got to enjoy a sourdough bowl of chowder up in the market, so then we had to find food for me. Score! The spicy tuna burrito is so delicious and the tortilla didn't fall apart. The potstickers were amazing, I haven't had one in years. Also, don't miss the blueberry soda. Just 3 ingredients, I enjoyed it so much when normally I don't do soda. Topped it off with a brownie! I'm visiting and this place has made me jealous of locals who get to enjoy it! Southeast Asian inspired fast food that is great for a quick meal or lunch.\nRecent came by to try their miso ramen with the lemongrass steak. When I finally got the bowl, I realized that it was a ramen in name only. The noodles used for the ramen were rice noodles typically used for Pad Thai, and most of the other toppings such as the pickled carrots and kale salad looked like salad bowl toppings. Nevertheless, the bowl actually turned out to be pretty good. Their approach to the dish was certainly unconventional, but with fresh ingredients and quality steak, it felt like eating a warm salad with a broth. Would probably return to try their other bowls. 4.2/5 Lamb Hand Pulled Noodle Soup - super thick noodles with  a very satisfying chew! Wish it were a more generous portion of lamb with less fatty portions\n\nWould consider coming back to try their flatbread!\n\nVisited around 6pm on a weeknight, not realizing they close at 6:30pm. Plenty of seating a couple blocks down by the Chinatown Gate if its a nice enough day to sit outside! Good place for a quick and filling lunch. I had a dumpling soup and lamb. All delicious, nothing complex and not too spicy (for my taste I took extra spicy but didn\u2019t find it spicy at all).When you dine-in you order from a screen and pay by card, very convenient. The food here is really good, always get the cumin lamb hand pulled noodles, remember the CUMIN that's the biang biang noodles, their hot and sour is also really good. The only complaint I have it's the inconsistent of the noodles, sometimes they get stuck together and a bit too chewy and uncooked ,but it's not too bad. Delicious, well priced, and located within walking distance of several T stations ( Gene's Flatbread is hands down my favorite lunch spot in Boston. All the food there is amazing and my favorites are Xi'an cold noodles and the cumin lamb noodles.\n\nAs a spicy food lover, something I especially like about Gene's is that they don't tone down the heat. Their extra spicy dishes are some of the hottest food I've found at any restaurant in the Boston area. And if you don't like spicy food then I recommend the pork flatbread instead, which is made with a sweet five spice blend instead! Ordered Uber eats, and was looking forward to eating falafel that was being advertised as \"kispy on the outside, soft on the inside\". Instead, I recieved falafel that was Krispy from crust to core. Very disappointed because the falafel is my favorite part. The fresh items were fine. Fantastic place. Has a small to medium sit down section indoors. Ketchup wasn\u2019t labeled for takeout but that\u2019s besides the point. Great tasting falafel. Good fixings. Great for meat eaters and veggie eaters. Being lived in Israel I have a good taste bud in Mediterranean food.\nThe service was excellent, the food was quick very clean and artistic dining environment.\n\nThe hummus was very authentic. A good balance of oil and sour test. The veggies are fresh but the falafel balls were over cooked in my plate. I\u2019m pretty sure that is not the case always. I will visit again. Thank you. I support and have been to clover many times, now finally getting around to a review. This place is great for lunch and a quick dinner option. On this visit, I ordered one of the newer items- Verde bowl with spicy tender pork. I've never had fake pork before and I quite I liked it. The bowl itself was well thought out and balanced, very flavorful with a good mix of textures. I might hesitate to order again tho as it has fried plantains/tostones and fried jalapenos which  I could get without, but then it seems to become an even smaller portion than it was. I feels it a bit expensive for what it is, but most things in this area are. Also they care about their where they get their ingredients, so I don't mind paying for that. The sides are great including the hummus, fries etc. I've had several other sandwiches including the meatball sub and falafel. Overall my only issue is they use more oil in their ingredients (eg fried or oily) than my tummy is used to. Tasty though, and would be fine for those with less sensitive stomachs. I will continue to support this trailblazing vegetarian/ vegan establishment who sources locally, and hope to see more thoughtful places like it in the immediate future. Innovative local vegetarian chain that focuses on sustainability and local sourcing.\nRecently had the chance to try some of their platters and sandwiches, and most items I got were pretty impressive. I\u2019m normally not a huge fan of vegetarian fast food chains, but they did a great job with getting the flavor combinations right. In house brewed vanilla soda was superb, and the impossible meatballs were the best vegan meatballs I had, and with the tomato sauce, it tasted more authentic than the non-vegetarian ones. The bbq seitan was the only item that wasn\u2019t appetizing.\nFor the price, the portions for each were smaller than I expected, but it was definitely worth a try. We came here for a quick food break. The Self ordering system made it quick and easy to order what we wanted. We grabbed a table number once our food was ready. A nice lady brought it to us and was very pleasant. We ate and left. For a quick bite to eat, it's definitely worth checking out. Good food and pleasant staff. 5 stars this place is a must to go with friends or family.  They are so nice Kai , Derek and the whole staff are like the Justice League.  When I have a bad day they save it and I just want to say the chicken the shakes the fries are all excellent too.  It\u2019s well lit, not too loud and very good to chat and eat. Burgers were smaller than I expected, but tasty.\n\nPeople say Shake Shack is basic, but so is everything else at Seaport so just eat whatever you want.\n\nI wanted burgers, I went to ShakeShack. Absolutely disgusting. This Shake Shack at Seaport Boston is a rodent-infested, overpriced excuse for a burger joint. Numerous reports have been made to the board of health about the rampant uncleanliness, yet no corrective action has been taken. Cross-contamination and filth run rampant, putting customers at risk of illness. It\u2019s shocking that this place is still operating under these conditions. If you care about your health, avoid this place at all costs! We were looking for a casual place for lunch that wasn't $50 a person. This was within walking distance, so that's where we went.\n\nWhen you come in, they have a machine to take your order. If you have been there before you know what to get, but never having been there, it was a lot to go through.\n\nMy spouse got the burger and I got a chicken sandwich. I also opted for one of the shakes.\n\nThe food looked wonderful. The fries were cold and had no salt on them. The burger was ordinary, as was the chicken. The chicken was cooked well and was crunchy. Neither had anything to make it a \"must go back\" for me.\n\nThe shake was chocolate salted caramel. What I had this built up to be in my mind wasn't what it was. I didn't  get any caramel, and the chocolate had a bitter taste to it.\n\nThis isn't  my favorite  meal ever, but it would work for a semi-quick meal that doesn't break the bank. Hmm, sorry but i wasnt that impressed. Burger and fries were solid but nothing special to me. Sorry to say that but i had better burgers! Service was amazing! Atmosphere was okay. Food is good, tasty and big portions. Unfortunately the service was not so good. The girl behind the counter had very unfriendly attitude. It looked like she didn\u2019t had to much patience for the customers like me. I was for the very first time there, and I needed some time to find out how it worked and to choose something. The girl behind the counter was not so happy seeing me without having ready order, just to be told. This place is great definitely one of the best burgers for a quick bite it's always delicious and the fries are fresh. I actually watched the female employee walk around with the broom and dustpan and pretend to sweep it was so bizarre like why what are you winning if you don't sweep up the stuff but walk around and pretend to do it the floor was a mess I don't understand why you wouldn't just sweep it up I found that to be like so ridiculous and it makes me wonder like do they clean up or even pay attention to that what's the back room look like for the walk-in freezer refrigerator things like that make me nervous when somebody doesn't take pride in everything they do I mean you're too good to sweep the floor it's kind of ridiculous. I've been enjoying French fries as the only accessibile comfort food because of my recent pancreatic illness. However, it is RARE that the high quality five guys fries are made WELL9. Usually soggy. I always request extra crispy fries \ud83c\udf5f but I've learned that if the oil is dirty the temperature \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f is not hot enough and thus the Saga of the Soggy French Fries... I think standardizing training on the double temp fry method with vigorous shaking in btw be instituted if not already. Love the Five Guys concept of Bag Fries \ud83c\udf5f the extra tray of fries IN ADDITION to the cup is I CREDIBLE psychology marketing \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\ude84\ud83d\ude06 Stopped by Five Guys on Summer Street and it was a mixed bag of experiences. On the high note, the food and service were exceptional. The classic hot dog topped with ketchup, mustard, and a delightful pickle salad was truly authentic and delicious. The fries were the star of the show\u2014perfectly crispy, well-seasoned, and the best I\u2019ve ever had, complemented wonderfully by unlimited Heinz ketchup.\n\nHowever, the visit wasn\u2019t without its downsides. The cleanliness, especially in the restroom area, left much to be desired. My wife found the facilities quite dirty, to the extent that she had to use her own wet wipes just to feel comfortable using them. It\u2019s a shame because the food and service are top-notch.\nOverall,\nfood and service get a 5/5,\nbut the atmosphere and cleanliness drag down the overall experience to a 3/5. Truly a first class experience! My dad and I sat at the bar before we went to the bruins game. The bartender, Julie, personalized our experience with a thoughtful note at the end. The General Manager\u2019s presence was an added bonus. Not only did he check on us, but I watched him introduce himself to every table. He\u2019s very handsome also! If I could give more stars, I would! My second trip back, and it didn't disappoint.\nOur waiter/ bartender Patrick was amazing interacting with us as well as giving us his recommendations. Going before the dinner rush is key, though!\nWe had a few appetizers to start oyster, shrimp cocktail, crabcake, and arancini. All were delicious, but I could have done without the arncini. For drinks, we started with a French 75 followed by the peach passion martini. For our main meal, the steak and shrimp pasta dish and king crab rositto. The steak I was told was cooked perfectly (blue). The shrimp dish was light but could use red pepper flakes. For dessert, we opted for just the tiramisu martini, which was the best way to end the night. You can order from the menu or the staff is happy to suggest specials and also make alterations to the specials to suite your cravings. You can't go wrong with seafood in Boston and their preparation of it makes sure you're just enjoying your food and not fighting it. Family-style menu makes it easy to get a ton of variety and split side dishes. This was probably the first time my steak was actually cooked medium rare. Delicious! I attended an event hosted by a company at this restaurant and the experience did not meet my expectations walking in. The restaurant is beautiful but the terrace area we were seated in felt as if the tables were very clumped together without much elbow room. This may have been the company trying to fit as many people in the room as possible (may not be the restaurant\u2019s fault).\n\nThe food was mediocre. The steak (that they are known for) was not cooked well and average at best. The pasta (which is not on their normal menu and may have been added to accommodate dietary restrictions for the event) was overcooked and mushy. The house tiramisu was sweet without much other flavor and was not authentic.\n\nI felt the service was rushed and staff seemed overwhelmed. I\u2019m not sure if this was specific to the conditions of this event or a reflection of their general work.\n\nThe enclosed terrace had overhead heating which was nice, but I\u2019m not sure if the heating could be adjusted. The event started off very warm with heat radiating down, and then it was switched off until I needed my coat while seated. The heat was again turned on towards the end of the night at full blast.\n\nOverall an unpleasant experience, but not sure how much of it should be attributed to the event trying to accommodate a large number of attendees. The GM and his staff were amazing.  We had our work outing there and they were very accommodating.  The Chef prepared all our meals to perfection.  We would like to thank the entire staff for making our experience a 10 out of 10 Went there for Dim Sum and the restaurant is looking rather run down. There were not many people there. Was expecting a bigger crowd. We got served and seared fast vs how I had remember when I went to the one in Boston Chinatown which had now closed down \u2639\ufe0f\n\nThe authenticate plates with their logo is still there remnants of how majestic and grand they were when they had both Boston and Dorchester running!\n\nThe food quality also had dropped. I felt the Dim Sum was not hot enough and became cold quickly. The taste was not how I remember either. Quality has dropped and the prices has gone up.\n\nOverall I have had better Dim Sum in Quincy. A truly unique and great experience. I love their pepper steak and house rice. Was not disappointed. Great hospitality and wonderful food. Got a chance to speak with the owner and he explained that it is a family owned business that has been around for years. I asked were they also affiliated with the location that use to be located in Downtown Boston, Chinatown. He said yes. I will be definitely returning again! Food has always been consistent and good. This is the first time I have been to this location, as I used to go to their Chinatown location all the time when it was open. Everything was absolutely disgusting! The lo mein was ice cold. I went in an ordered and was home in 5 minutes! The egg rolls were so greasy and burnt as were the beef teriyaki and tuff! The fried rice tasted burnt and old, egg foo yung was swimming in grease that was supposed to be gravy\u2026No Gravy!!!! I wish this had smellovision taking these photos all I smell is burnt!!!! I would give it a minus 5 stars!!!  Do Not Recommend! Never Again! Always friendly people. Tasty food. Only open when classes are in session. Closed from May-Aug. Good food and good service Our favorite food is the bacon cheese and egg bagel. Good breakfast for three days Disrespectful staff who don\u2019t care about the quality of food they serve Wonderful owners, great products. Thanks for the extra donut! wonderful people, great food, and they were kind enough to hold into my wallet id lost the day prior!!! thank you so much!!!\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a The TOP Dunkie! They do it right \u2014 flawless service - especially morning rush hour! Chantai and team are in the zone in the AM! Good food.  I had the broadside burger and my boyfriend had some kind of chicken sandwich. Service was amazing. Music and atmosphere were great.  I loved the map on the ceiling.  I would come here over and over again.  We sat at the bar and we were comfy and happy. My husband and I had dinner at Broadside Tavern since we were staying next door at The Dagny Hotel due to the convenience of its proximity. We were seated almost immediately and requested to be put somewhere away from the door since it was so cold outside and the hostess gladly did so. Our waitress was sitting in the booth behind the one we were placed at having personal conversations with the bartender and some of the customers at the bar and she took her time coming to greet us and taking our orders. Luckily, we weren\u2019t in a hurry but it did make it feel as though our business wasn\u2019t super important. Once she waited on us, she was very personable and courteous, however. My husband and I both ordered the clam chowder and it was amazing! I think I could\u2019ve only eaten that and left full and happy. We did order the steak sandwich and Reuben as our entrees. The Reuben was tasty and flavorful and the French fries were crispy and well seasoned. My husband said the steak sandwich was cooked well and easy to eat, but could\u2019ve used some type of sauce or other seasoning. He really liked the soft bread it was on. The atmosphere is nice as long as you understand it\u2019s a bar and the patrons may get a little noisy. I would definitely eat there again and would make sure I ordered the clam chowder. Yum. If you\u2019re looking for an exceptional dining experience in Boston\u2019s Financial District, Broadside Tavern is a must-visit. From the moment you walk in, you\u2019re greeted with friendly service that makes you feel right at home. The ambiance is both welcoming and stylish, reflecting the tavern\u2019s commitment to cleanliness and maintenance.\n\nThe food at Broadside Tavern is nothing short of spectacular. Each dish is crafted with care, offering a perfect blend of quality and flavor. The portion sizes are generous, providing great value for the price. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for a hearty meal or a lighter option, the menu caters to all tastes and preferences with a range of delectable choices.\n\nIn summary, Broadside Tavern delivers a remarkable dining experience with excellent food, attentive service, and an inviting atmosphere\u2014all at very reasonable prices. It\u2019s a standout choice in the Financial District and definitely worth a visit. Busy but not packed. Waited only 5 or so mins on a Saturday night. I had the jalape\u00f1o burger (no bun) and my niece had the scallops. Staff was great, food was quick Nice pub with good food and drinks.  Large selection of beers on tap. if you go to this McDonald's don't use the app. I ordered & paid on McDonald's app for pick up while traveling through boston on greyhound bus then employees said I had to pay again before receiving my order. Very poor customer service. No, seating. Table to stand & eat at was dirty. Don't think I would go to this McDonald's again. On a positive note fries were hot & fresh \ud83c\udf5f. 3 Stars mostly because food quality was actually good. WORST MCDONALD'S EVER. Very rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional team working the registers! The manager even slammed the scanner on the counter when I had to place another order for a sundae cone with my QR code! The manager couldn't care less to check whether your coupon/deal applied to your order or not! They are also very stingy with nugget sauces and make you feel interrogated for asking! I asked for BBQ sauce when I saw I only had ketchup packets for my chicken nugget meals and the cashier said the sauces were only for nuggets which I showed her I ordered! She and the manager then spoke in Spanish in front of me as if I was being questioned for asking for BBQ sauce! Can't I have ketchup for my fries and BBQ sauce for my nuggets??? It is also VERY BASIC customer service to repeat the order to the customer to ensure everything is right! They also just filled my large fries halfway, to add to it, there is some cross-contamination going on as there were Oreo crumbs in my fries. Looks like I am not the only one with the same issues with this branch. How is it that corporate hasn't retrained these employees on customer service fundamentals? Disgusting in all aspects! Taking into consideration it's a busy location the lack of service is still mind boggling. They stand in the kitchen speaking a foreign language and completely I mean look at you and turn their head to continue talking ignore you . Waited 11 minutes at register then they come after  they were done talking no food in hands while talking so not working hard with an attitude to take order. The absolute worst customer service in a McDonald's I've ever seen They charge top dollar and do not mix the McFlurrys. I also got a $5 order of fries right before they closed and they were not hot. Granted it was right before they closed so it\u2019s understandable. But they couldn\u2019t return the money for the non-hot fries so I had to take the loss and walk away as a dissatisfied customer. $5 wasted. Nice people who work there though. They just look at you crazy when something needs correction. Otherwise it\u2019s a regular Mickey D\u2019s. Employees shouldn't be blaming customers that their equipment is broken. They should also learn to listen & STOP giving the wrong order when you get the same thing every day & they still screw it up. If there was another option I would do that but sadly it'd this or nothing & nothing is sounding better. The food was way under portions, I mean come on I pay almost 18 dollars for my salad and this Is all I get. Then I get there and one of the workers with black hair and doesn\u2019t speak English very well is so rude. I was just receiving attitude the complete time, and she even rolled her eyes at me when I asked for just a little bit more of lettuce then talked about me as if I didn\u2019t know Spanish to one of the other staff members . Un professional\n(This is a couple weeks later and i came back to be treated even worse i cant stand this place and the guy in the picture is so rude ) This place is so good to stop by and get a nice salad ,\nI was in Boston for business going from meeting to meetings and I stop to this wonderful place we\u2019re I got a great salad ,\n\nSo recommended Love the fish tacos at sweetgreen! I always enjoy my meals here and one of the best thing about ordering at sweetgreen is that you get to customize your meal just the way you like it. Good food! A great place to eat health. Service was great. Love the ability to add \u201cmix please\u201d to my app profile name in order to get my preordered salad mixed. I also appreciate that they stay current on what greens are labeled as a risk for E. coli. Thanks, Sweetgreen! Regularly is missing ingredients, and they substitute things without asking.  Would recommend going to one of the other nearby locations or the Just Salad 100 yards away. This review is for both Foumami (lunch takeout/dine-in) and Makeboluo Pizza (evening takeout).\n\nMakeboluo, the sister concept of Foumami, invented the concept of scallion pancake pizza dough (in comparison to deep dish, NY style, Detroit style, etc) with Asian-inspired toppings! We tried the Soseji and 5 spice BBQ; I preferred the Soseji for its  unique standout flavors. It had sambal chili sauce and sesame soy pork sausage, and the 5 spice BBQ was topped with 5 spice chicken and Asian bbq sauce. The crust was sooo flaky and tasty by itself and seriously tastes like a scallion pancake. I found myself longing for the sweet soy dipping sauce while eating the crust. When I go back, I'm definitely trying their more unique Asian flavors that really make this business stand out like the Kewpie pizza. You can find Makeboluo on UberEats!\n\nI've also tried a couple of sandwiches from Foumami that use authentic shao bing bread, which is a flakier crispy bread similar to a scallion pancake. Since the bread is on the drier side compared to a soft fluffy bread, I recommend getting the sandwiches that comes with sauce like the chicken katsu! However, my favorite sandwich was the Spicy grilled pork loin, which came with pickled vegetables and reminded me of a banh mi. MOST DELICIOUS food in the financial district! I can not sing their praises enough. I go here at least twice a week for their bibimbap salad. It is So Unique, inventive and borderline addictive. I can't get enough of it and they give your fantastic homemade Scallion pancakes with every meal. It should have been 4 stars.\nThis is why I ask for sauce on the side. Now this beautiful salad is like a sad and droopy soup.\nI know it's easier for you and cuts down wait time if everything is prepped for fast service.\nOur office is walking distance from Foumami Franklin St, but this was a wasted walk on a lovely late afternoon.\nI hope you take this as constructive and will make a salad with sauce on the side as usually occurs upon request anywhere else. Why not please the customer? Maybe you will see more of us return with happy expectations.\nThe rice and protein is fine, but the salad is ruined, hence the 2 stars instead of 4.\nSo sorry I couldn't give you more. Love this spot!!! Such a unique and flavorful taste. Their scallion pancake pizzas and sandwiches are so delicious. I would highly recommend coming here for lunch or takeout for dinner. Can\u2019t wait to be back. Sandwich was reasonably tasty (the spicy grilled pork loin is the one I chose), though nowhere near as spicy as I would've preferred. The quality of materials is good, but the quantity is poor. Do not go here if you are hungry.\n\nThe scallion pancakes were very disappointing and not worth getting as a side. Too thick and lacking nuance in flavor and texture.\n\nOverpriced location, too, in the Financial District of Boston. I\u2019ve never seen Mediterranean avocado toast before and was pleasantly surprised by how good it is! It comes sans olives, which I love, and is just enough to take the edge off. Two tables inside with a few chairs Archie\u2019s is a typical breakfast take-out spot.  I had the breakfast burrito, and it was pretty good.  However, after talking to a few people, I know I should have ordered the breakfast sandwich on the Portuguese bun.  Next time.  Service was pretty good.  Ordering was not as intimidating as a \u2018real\u2019 NY deli :) and the burrito came out very quickly.  I\u2019ll definitely return. Ordered the Yahoo (fried egg, hash brown, bacon, cheese) on Portuguese muffin. Excellent sandwich. Traveling and spot was near hotel. Only small negative is it\u2019s a little small to eat in. However we ate in the office lobby. Highly recommend. Stopped by Archies, and wow\u2014so good! The sandwiches were loaded with fresh, tasty ingredients, and the service was super friendly and quick. I\u2019m still thinking about the Turkey Rachel (we did dressing on the side)\u2014seriously delicious. Great spot for a sandwich/lunch. Definitely coming back! Stumbled over this way in light of rumor on the street for a ray of sunshine to one\u2019s work week. Met the standard. Excellent. Fantastic service, speed, and hospitality. The Italian grinder was stellar. An extensive catalogue of options. I will be back and know I will find my new favorite sandwich/sub in post office square here. I rounded to five stars as the minor setback was a 7/10 on the Italian meats feeling light. Highly recommend this for a go to lunch spot downtown. I keep trying to like this place but something is always amiss. Ordered take out and all of the sashimi in it was frozen. Not my idea of fresh fish in a sushi restaurant. What WAS thawed out was fine tasting, but not worth the money I spent at all Really solid spot for the price. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed the sushi rolls, and they were quite affordable. It is also a tight, small seating area but its cute and fun. The service was also decent as well. I would recommend going with the rolls that aren't \"special\" because even though the special ones are good, and maybe worth a try, the regular sushi rolls are good and give you more value for money. While exploring Chinatown in Boston, we wanted to find an authentic sushi place and even though sushi is Japanese, and we were in Chinatown, we found a great little place! Avana sushi was tucked into unassuming little food court, where three or four other businesses are packed in a small space. There is limited seating, but there is inside seating. There was a bit of a language barrier as the owners wasn\u2019t great, but we got through it! Everything they made was from scratch, and it was amazing! We got there right as they opened and we were the first customers but as we sat there eating our food, the phone didn\u2019t stop ringing and local customers poured in and out nonstop ordering lunch to go which for us as a telltale sign that this is a place that the locals love and that tells you everything you need to know! I would definitely recommend this if you\u2019re looking for sushi in Boston! We will be back! Great sushi at affordable prices. Nice staff and I recommend the Lunch special! Went to pick up avana sushi and then ate it at home. It is a bit tricky to find, but its actually a mini-mall/food court area inside a slightly larger complex. The sushi is cheap and tasty. You get filled up pretty well. You can get 32 basic rolls for 30 dollars. Id say thats a good deal. Highly recommend the spicy tuna and salmon rolls. Specialty rolls are great as well. We came in pretty late, so it was quiet. The atmosphere was really chill. Our server, Eric, was so charming and friendly.\nI had a mocktail called The Oasis. It  was absolutely divine. Their cocktail and fries were really good.\nHappy hour oysters were such a good deal which is only available on Monday and Friday 4-7pm. The wait and bar staff are always prompt, kind, and accomdating. I love that you can order an off menu cocktail and it's actually made correctly (good margaritas are hard to come by in Boston but Merchant never disappoints). The food is great especially for the price. Highly recommend! We had a group dinner at The Merchant, and while the food was pretty good, the service really missed the mark. Even though the place was only about a third full, our drinks took forever to come out, so much so that we were almost done with our appetizers by the time the first round finally arrived. It was a bit frustrating that we weren't checked in on often, so we ended up not ordering much more. The food did make up for it to some extent\u2014it was definitely tasty\u2014but the slow service put a damper on the experience. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth a visit if you\u2019re in the area, but just be prepared for a potentially slower pace. Probably my favorite restaurant I had on my work trip to Boston. It was a group dinner and we had so much food. The calamari and wings were amazing! I got the Palomina (?) drink and the burger and a wedge salad as my meal. Our service Makayla was amazing and knowledgeable about the food menu and the drink menu. I tried the avocado BLT, southwest chicken wrap, and harvest kale salad. The avocado BLT was pretty good. The bread was nicely toasted, and the bacon was crunchy and not too salty. There could have been more avocado, though. Similarly, the southwest chicken wrap was good overall but could have used more chicken. The toasted corn added a nice bite. For the harvest kale salad, I liked the dried cranberries. Burger was great although a little dry. Nevertheless, I absolutely love how the beef patty was cooked! Go here pretty often and the food is always solid. Menu does change on occasion but always have good food. Also been to a location in Concord NH that\u2019s solid. Good food, quick service all around Excellent fast service. Glad the staff here can cook/fry an egg on my burgers exactly as I describe it. Clean. Delicious local food from nearby farms. The manager Chenadie was very friendly and welcoming. Andy too. I love this restaurant. Will come back. The new flexitarian burger menu is amazing. Unique and quite flavorful. Jalape\u00f1o ranch chicken sandwich was decent the salad bowl I got was really good though and same w the cauliflower bites Tacos anytime me free m Taco bell is the best. Munching or dinner does not matter, but grab some ne at a go, but you will love them. I Have them fresh as the taste differs if being cold.\nStaff at this place are very kind and supportive. I have been a customer for about an long as this Bell has been open. There are always ebbs and flows to any fast food place, but they are doing it right on Summer. If anything the place has gotten better with time!! I'm allergic to cheese and not once this year have they messed up my order. Anyone with an allergy will know how rare this is. Also rare- there seems to always be someone at the front register who is ready to help you find your pick up order with a smile!! The folks who work here are very pleasant and deserve to have their hard work seen. Soda machine tastes like it is regularly cleaned and the meat has never been burned. Stellar!! After waiting for 20min for my online order- no issue a lot of other people were waiting as well they offered everyone besides me a drink while they waited. I honestly felt sad about it because I was there longer than anyone else. I go home excited but realized I had no extra condiments I had paid for. Been coming in regularly for over a year now and am always satisfied with the food quality, portions, service, and wait times. Staff are super friendly and do their best to get the food out ASAP. Haven\u2019t been too late in the evening but any time from open to 9pm I\u2019ve had great experiences! Usually this place is chaotic at night, but during the day it\u2019s clean and there\u2019s not much of a wait for food. Really really good food here! The pretzel bites are timeless and delicious, and the frozen lemonades are good! I wish they'd give bigger (wider) straws for the lemonades, to better get the non-liquid out. The only other complaint is that it IS quite expensive, but worth the occasional trip anyway. Food tasted fine and staff were OK, my issue mostly is not only how overpriced the food is but also there is a lot of menu items here that are missing at other locations. To add insult to injury, these items are advertised here, but when asked the staff say they will not be coming to that location. So whats even the point? Lovely place to grab a quick bite while waiting at South Station. I love the original Auntie Anne's pretzel! I wish there was a little less salt on it but I enjoy the buttery texture of the pretzel! They have been out of chocolate ice cream for multiple months. There wasn\u2019t an option not to leave a tip. So, I did. But strange that it wouldn\u2019t let me not leave one. Initially I wanted the pretzel bites but Auntie Annie\u2019s didn\u2019t have a utensil to pick them up with. Since, it wasn\u2019t clean, I ordered the original pretzel. It honestly tasted 2 days old, so I ended up throwing it away It may not be the best pizza in Boston, but it was still delicious! I ordered a slice of cheese, pepperoni, and meatball. The meatball was my favorite\u2014very flavorful and the combinations worked really well together (and normally I don't love meatball pizza). It is a really good deep dish pizza that is cheesy with a slight crunch on the bottom. Definitely recommend if you want pizza and you're in the area! However, still hard to compete with Pizzeria Regina. This is a tough review to write because I realize this is still a new business and yes it was their first weekend. I will adjust my review next time if improved. However, the inefficiencies of this pick up counter are glaring. Instead of selling the visible pizzas directly to the customer at the register, there was a giant backlog of orders. it didn't make sense to stick to the ticket system and have people wait only to get cold pizza. And the people who put orders in and left didn't come back so there were several orders just sitting there. In the end, we waited 30 min to get a slice that had been sitting in the window the whole time, but they had originally told us was already sold. I'm no expert but I think there's probably a better way to do this.\n\nThe pizza itself was decent, really bready and oily which I think is the point but ends up feeling a bit heavy. The slices are enormous and filling, prob could get away with half a slice. The sauce was really good but unfortunately the cheese slice barely had any. I loved the burnt edge caramelized cheese. If I was passing this place and they sold me a pizza out of the window right away, I'd be happy to have it again, but I wouldn't wait again for a cold slice. I was in town for work and I tried this place because the pizza looked good. Unfortunately looks can be deceiving. The service was very mediocre with a lack of service and the pizza was tough and chewy, didn't have much flavor besides oiliness... had the \"Sausage & Pepps\" and after one bite I was done and also had the \"Cheese Please\" and after a few bites I had abandoned it also... Save yourself the disappointment and try a different place. Love the options at HSP but Tenderoni\u2019s leaves much to be desired. The pizza is good but the employees are not friendly at all. I recently preordered the Veggie Val sandwich for pick up. When I opened it, it had no crispy artichokes on it. You\u2019d think they would have told me or something. Maybe give me the option to order something else. Email, call, whatever. Instead they sent me on my way with one of the main ingredients missing from my $13 sub. Cool\nThere is also no way to contact them aside from a phone number which is fruitless. The pizza here was solid, and it's more on the breedy side. I got the mushroom & cheese pizza. The customer service was good, and the cashier was welcoming.\n\nIf you're just around the high street area, it would be a place to stop by.. I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're driving about.\n\nAlso, the facility is very clean as well. A lot more fun than most of the bars in Boston\nReally good atmosphere- bouncers on the door very pleasant. Staff also lovely.\nSmall compact and good drinks served Prices are great, atmosphere is super fun. Open until 2am seen days a week. This is Boston's secret spot! Awesomesauce it is! We stumbled in here on a recent stay in Boston and we didn\u2019t want to leave. The prices were amazing and it was the best dive bar atmosphere. Watching people file in on a Friday after work was the best part just reassuring this was the place to be. Will be back! This is absolutely my favorite bar in Boston! Great company, Darragh is the best bartender there is. Nothing but accommodating and giving us recommendations visit places around Massachusetts. Absolutely loved the people and this bar!!! Highly recommend!!! I've been passing by this bar for at least 10 years, and never been in it.  Thursday evening, calling it a night figure I'll stop by one more pint before decomposing for the rest of the evening.\n\nIn ideal irish pub fashion, you get what you expect.  If you're looking for a chic modern fufu cocktails, go somewhere else. You got a divey bar with decent beer selections, kind of the local, and late night Corp folks that's looking to unwind.  Relaxed chill vibes, until you sit next to someone who's highly opinionated and speaking at plus plus volumes trying to impression the other person. \ud83d\ude06\n\nAnyways, chill vibe, awesome bar tender, expected atmosphere.  Not sure if they have pub eats or not. There are plenty of other options in High Street Food Hall, but don't go here. They're suppose to specialize in ONE type of food: Fried Chicken. But just about every aspect of fried chicken absolutely failed. First bite is okay with the crisp, but it ends there. As soon as the breading hits your palettes, it has absolutely no seasoning and flavor. So saltiness, no spices, nothing. The buns are absolutely flat. And the main ingredient, the chicken itself wasn't even cooked all the way and I had to pull apart the ligaments.\nWhen fried chicken is becoming the latest trend, they are thousand percent abysmal.. I had the ricky bobby. The sauce and the combine with other ingredients were tasty. Fillet had thick crust, some parts of the chicken looked kinda raw. As a chef me self I know this level raw looking is \u201ceatable safe\u201d (I also checked the heat level of that part ofc.) but it shows that you have some frying issues. Need more time to full cook. Chicken products are one of the most risky protein in kitchen, you must take care of this situation. Was so excited to try because it sounds like the recipes are tasty but just like the other comments I am worried about food safety. Biting into the sandwich, the meat was very rare. When I asked about it, the chef said that he had \u201ctested it with the meat thermometer but it\u2019s thigh meat so it\u2019s more tender.\u201d I ate more before throwing out the rest and getting really sick that evening. Sauces were tasty & adult caprisun was cool though. Chicken sandwich was good, not great. The service was fairly fast but the flavor was nothing special - which made me a little sad. I love fried chicken sandwiches, and I was eager to try Haley Jane's. But the flavor and texture of the fried filet and the food safety problems I observed make it unlikely that I will return.\n\nHaley Jane's serves fried chicken sandwiches for $12. Several variations are available, differing primarily in choice of sauce. I had a \"smashville\", which adds a mildly spicy seasoning and a sandwich sauce. The filet itself is pounded thin and surrounded by a very thick breading. The meat is not as juicy or flavorful as what you might have at Chick-fil-a, and the breading, while thick, is not a crunchy as you might expect from a fried chicken joint. Instead, the breading is a bit too thick and chewy, the chicken itself is too thin and plain, and the toppings end up providing most of the flavor. The sauce, seasoning, bun, and pickles were all tasty and did their job well, but it wasn't enough to save the sandwich.\n\nThe reason for these weaknesses in the filet is surely due to the rather convoluted process the restaurant employs to prepare them. In the 45 minutes I spent in line, ordering, waiting, and eating I observed the process several times. The cook starts with a pre-breaded filet from a large tray of pre-breaded filets. (This large tray of raw chicken remained on the counter, partially covered, at room temperature, for the entire time I was there - concerning!) The raw filets are fried in a deep fryer and then held in a heat drawer. As needed, the cook would take filets from the heat drawer and refresh them by returning them to the fryer for around 60 seconds. They would then be used in sandwiches, served very hot.\n\nThe process of pre-breading, frying, resting, and frying again results in chewier breading with less crunch. What you want, and what you get elsewhere, is a freshly-breaded filet, fried once, and served shortly after. For $12 I expected a very fresh fried chicken filet, not the imitation of freshness in a filet breaded hours (days?) earlier and fried thirty minutes prior.\n\nFinally, the food safety concerns are a problem. It should be unacceptable to any restaurant to store raw chicken on the counter for the 45 minutes I observed. In addition, the cook used the same gloves when transferring raw chicken as when handling buns, cooked filets, and fries. I also noted that he used his finger to taste some seasoning at one point and continued to use the same gloves.\n\nI am sorry that this is the first review. I have no grudge against Haley Jane's. I hope they can improve both their process and food safety practices and continue serving me fried chicken sandwiches for years to come. Definitely we will repeat! We selected the Fall foliage special roll with crab, salmon, tuna\u2026 and the savor is woaa! Fantastic! It is the best sushi place close to Seaport! The food hall with the DJ is a great option for a Saturday afternoon! I\u2019m writing this review as a regular\u2014I go once or twice a week. You\u2019d never think that sushi in a food hall is going to be amazing. But it is. I usually order ahead because it gets busy, and they always prepare it on time. The staff is pleasant and friendly.\n\nBut let\u2019s get to the most important part: the sushi is great! I\u2019m really particular about the freshness of sushi, I can smell something off a mile away. But here, the quality is outstanding. The tuna is always a deep, dark red, and they even have toro tuna!! I opt for simple sashimi or basic rolls but their fancy rolls are so fun and different. Honestly, you probably won\u2019t find better sushi takeout in the area. One of the best poke bowls I've had in Boston. Will definitely come back to this place to try out the other dishes. Awesome Sushi! Had eel with salmon just makes for a great combo! The staff was so friendly and welcoming and the food was delicious! Good food and they brought out a birthday gong! The chicken skewer bowl is delicious and a great portion for $14.  If you're starving you'll finish it, otherwise you may end up with a little extra, as I did.\n\nChicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked and you get a ton of it.\n\nThe service is certainly not bad, but a little bedside manner is recommended. I\u2019m eating the Chicken Skewer bowl as we speak and for 14$ , it\u2019s delicious and incredible value for your buck . Worth a 10 minute wait .tender Chicken   It\u2019s all full flavored and fresh , very fluffy rice and excellent hummus.\nI\u2019ll def be back . Decent food and quick service. I ordered Chicken skewer plate and the quantity was good. However, I felt the chicken to be bland and wasn\u2019t grilled properly. Might go back again to try other items on their menu. Great Vegan options,  delicious.  Fast service,  friendly market atmosphere. Review for HUM'OVEH. The staff was excellent. The sandwich was really creative and light yet satisfying. Could amp the spice. Reminded me of a favorite saj that I have loved in Europe. Wish they were using the laffa or saj dome oven and had different varieties with more traditional fillings like labneh, pickles and hot sauce. Would love love love to try the breakfast menu and would like to see extended breakfast on weekends please! This place was super cool but I think I made the wrong choices when it comes to picking what I wanted!\n\nI got the famous Boston Cream Pie (wasn\u2019t a fan at all, I don\u2019t like milk chocolate so that one is on me). The cake and the cream were really good aside from chocolate.\n\nI got that little strawberry because it looked cute, I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say it tasted like medicine! It was super strong in flavor and not a good one.\n\nI walked by the place twice and saw really long lines both days, without having any background about what it is. I simply just wanted to try it but it wasn\u2019t what I was looking for.\n\nThere is waiting for sure if you wanna buy something, but the line goes by so fast because they got a couple employees working. This is a CASH only spot, I had to go to an ATM across the street to get some cash.\n\nI still recommend trying this place out, maybe choose better options and leave a better review:) Decadent cannolies that are a bit pricey, but worth it to try. We stopped while doing the freedom trail. It was a Tuesday night so the line wasn't too long. Had the original, pistachio, and amaretto. The ameretto was amazing with the chocolate coating. Would recommend the place for a treat. Maybe don't go here everyday or you may get harpooned in the harbor... Bakery store for to go, as no seating area. Staff are friendly and service is fast. They have many options including cakes. We only tried cannoli with ricotta cheese, that tastes very good. Assuming other products tastes very good as well! Prices are a little on high end. They only take cash. Tried 2 cannolis and a slice of their Boston Cr\u00e8me pie. The cannolis were over the top good. Flavor, texture and structure were awesome. Still want more after it\u2019s gone good. Too bad it\u2019s cash only. Limited my sample size. :( Mike\u2019s Pastry - Hanover Street.\n\nYou know you\u2019re close because you start seeing people carrying little white boxes with blue ink lettering \u201cMike\u2019s Pastry\u201d.\n\nEventually you arrive wondering why is this place so popular. Once you step in and browse the glass cases it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\nSo many choices, but you can\u2019t eat all. You must pace yourself.\n\nIn any event the pastries are delicious some better than others but that\u2019s strictly a personal choice.\n\nAlways seems busy. Priority is to get you in and order. Not much organization for ordering but , eventually it happens.\n\nGreat place to snack on a dessert anytime.\n\nA whole pastry or single portion available.\n\nThe pastry chefs do it right at Mike\u2019s Pastry. Even on Christmas Day!\n\nCash only!\n\n4.5\u2b50\ufe0f The food was okay but the service was so poor that we certainly won\u2019t be returning. The guy who made the sandwiches couldn\u2019t care less about us being there (although there was only one single other client at the restaurant), did not really answer any questions, and was not very friendly overall. It was a very strange experience, felt like we were burdening them with us ordering food. We wanted to originally dine in but decided to leave because we did not felt welcome. The worst service I\u2019ve ever seen messed up three sandwiches wouldn\u2019t even listen to what I want on the sandwich after I told her don\u2019t throw it away. I\u2019m more than happy to pay for it. I\u2019ll just give it away to someone wouldn\u2019t even listen kept on making mistake after mistake at some point I just wanted to walk out. This guy literally saved my day. The place was almost closed and they still prepared a sandwich. My first meal of the crazy day. Thanks! Decent food but horrible service. The store was empty, and the employee certainly didn\u2019t look happy seeing me come in. When asked if I was picking up, I answered that I was placing an order. The employee pointed to the \u201corder here\u201d sign and didn\u2019t say anything. When I ordered, what I assumed was them repeating my order back to me, felt condescending as if he couldn\u2019t understand me. I had walked over towards the register and noticed they stopped making my order and had gone back to the task they were previously working on before I came in. I had asked to add extra toppings/sauces, and they pointed to their toppings section and said, \u201cAdd there.\u201d When I listed my toppings, they would repeat each ingredient after adding it then pause for the next one, making me repeat myself several times for the rest of the toppings I wanted \u2014 which is fine, but I didn\u2019t appreciate the attitude that came with it. Very unfriendly environment, I would not come back again. This place has a prominently displayed pot for fresh brewed iced tea, which I love. I was there around supper time, and they actually don't have fresh brewed iced tea - when I asked for it they said they don't actually have it - that the pot was empty.  I pointed out how odd it was to have the pot but not actually have the tea.  The girl I was talking to didn't seem to care.  She said she only works nights and doesn't know what they do in the mornings.  I left without buying anything.  It was frustrating for them to advertise that they have something they don't actually have.  It seems like a terrible way to run a business. WARNING: Front door is actually on Devonshire St, not on Federal.\nSuper cute, clean place with smiling staff and filling, scrumptious acai bowls. Would definitely recommend and come back again.\nPictured: Sundaze bowl w/ added blended acai and added pumpkin seeds Having a place with so many vegan options right downstairs from my work is amazing. The smoothies are delicious and the pre-packaged snacks are great.\n\nNot the cheapest place, so I wouldn't go every day, but it scratches the itch when you need a little something and don't feel like going out for coffee. Went in today for lunch after getting a buy-one-get-one coupon and ended up trying both their Power smoothie bowl and Avocado grain bowl. I didn't have much in the way of expectations since I haven't heard of them before and I wasn't planning on returning since I already have my lunch places figured out in Boston, but I was pleasantly surprised and will most definitely be retuning soon.\n\nThe space was very nice with ample seating, setting it apart from other smoothie places in the area. Cashier and line workers were also very polite and made for a pleasant experience.\n\nThe power bowl seemed, based on the ingredients, like the most interesting smoothie bowl. Although I was a little skeptical when seeing the size of the actual bowls, it was filled up to the brim with smoothie and toppings making for a good value. Both flavor and quality were divine, and I may just have found my new favorite smoothie place. I've previously frequented Cocobeet and tried most of the others, including Juice Press, Squeeze, Kwench, but Fresh Press has them all beat if my experience today is anything to go off. Both in terms of value, quality, flavor, and variety.\n\nThe avocado bowl seemed like the most interesting grain bowl as it came with ingredients such as air-fried broccoli, spiced sunflower seeds, tomatoes, (obviously) avocado, garlic tahini dressing, and your choice of grains - I opted for the wild rice. Although it was probably the largest (and heaviest) bowl of food I've ever received from anywhere but Chipotle, making it a good value offering, I was unfortunately extremely disappointed by the flavor. Or rather lack thereof. Apart from the occasional piece of broccoli, there was nothing in the bowl that provided anything interesting at all making for the most boring dining experience I've had. I could see the garlic tahini dressing so they didn't forget it, but perhaps put too little or maybe it's just flavorless to start. Either way, I cannot recommend the grain bowls.\n\nRegardless, I came in today for the smoothie bowls, that's what I'll come back for, and that's what I'll base my review off of. So if you're in the area during weekday lunchtime looking for a smoothie bowl definitely stop by! I'm never one to complain much about anything. And I know they just recently opened. But I ordered the avocado bowl and they missed a couple of ingredients the first time. So I brought it back and mentioned it to the nice gentleman working the register. He said he'd do it over. So he proceeds to do it over and this time they forget the avocado on the avocado bowl. I know the place is new but how can you forget the ingredients twice (especially the second time). They forgot the avocado which is what the salad bowl is called. This place is amazing! We need more healthy type places like this. I had the hummus bowl and matcha hemp latte, it was so good and fresg tasting. They have this cool moss wall too. Then when I was leaving the friendly cashier let me know that the bowl and lid were compostable. I thought that was so cool. Definitely gonna be one of my regular stops now. If you\u2019re looking for a yummy lunch option that tastes fresh and healthy, this is the place to come! They have bowls and pitas but you can also build your own. My only complaint with this location is that it lacks seating, so a table can be hard to come by during peak times. I had accidentally left my keys at CAVA the night before and only realized it the next morning. Thankfully, Louise (hope I\u2019m spelling that right!) was incredibly helpful\u2014she picked up the call right away and made sure my keys were safe and ready for pickup. Her kindness and professionalism truly saved my morning! On top of that, the food was delicious as always. Huge thanks to the team at CAVA and especially to Louise for the amazing service. Definitely 5 stars! Thanks Jesus for great service. I wanted to update with a picture. Salad is delicious! If Sweetgreen and Committee had a baby, it would be Cava. I loved how I got to customize my bowl with all of the things I wanted at a very reasonable price. The dressings and toppings I had were fresh and I consumed the whole thing for a filling meal. I definitely rank this highly among other bowl/salad places! Food and service were awesome. Everything was clean and the line was fast. Jesus took care of us in the line and always attentive to the items we were selecting. I had high expectations from this place and went in super hungry but it did not meet expectations in multiple ways. Instead of an over arching verdict, i\u2019ll dive into the details.\n\nI got a plate with chicken, cauliflower and moussaka as my sides.\n\n1. Rice - the rice was undercooked. I eat at multiple Mediterranean joints in a week and I know when the rice sticks under your molars.\n2. Chicken was warm and well cooked.\n3. Both sides were ice cold. Keeping in mind that these are warm sides (fried cauli and moussaka), they tasted bland. Very unprofessional for whoever designed the menu and decided to serve it cold.\n4. The plate comes with 2 sauces by default which I was not told. The only visible sauce is tzatziki and I got just that, only to realise it\u2019s a $2 up charge. They did offer me the free sauce after but it was a waste for me. Honestly, your first sauce should be free.\n5. The pita was probably warmed once in the morning but it was so hard to bite that I had to throw it away.\n6. Quantity - quantity is decent and it did fill me up however I wont be returning as the joint lacks quality.\n\nI hope the owner/chef is open to feedback and looks into these things. I would not recommend this place as a local guide until they improve. I did not like it.   Probably the worst Shawarma that I have ever eaten.  I had the beef and lamb.  The meat tasted funny like adobo or something.   I thought the wrap was quite smaller than what you would see in other mediterranean restaurants.   This place felt like mediterranean version of chipotle or subway.  I will not return here. Clean environment, which is a good choice for lunch during workdays. Price is suitable. Food is healthy. The toasted chicken is not greasy. Taste is OK (depends on each person\u2019s preference). Visited on weekend - the meat was dry, looks it was waiting a long a side before served.... nothing super bad but not worth to visit...\n\nVisited Cambridge branch before a couple years and it was a better experience... The shawarma was dry and the (warm) sides were cold. It was a good price for the quantity of food, but not good quality. Should\u2019ve seen the reviews before buying anything here just paid $15 for a half boiled cabbage wrap advertised as a vegetarian mushroom wrap. It tasted so bad it almost made me want to cry. PLEASE NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. The food is consistently late it never shows up on time, I'm talking 1 hour plus. Not sure if they're being cheap by having their  in house delivery service but at this point, you should just let Grubhub deliver for you. In addition, don't bother calling no one ever picks up the phone. Just sad!!!!! Big fan of their salads. I am always on the hunt for healthy alternatives to everyday fast food and I have to say that this place has some seriously good options. Big fan of their steak salad, which is very healthy and tastes great. Its always an investment to pay a little bit more for your health, and I think its a great place to try out. This place consistently overcooks their food, forgets items and puts an absurd amount of sauce in their quinoa bowls. I have never been more disappointed by a lunch destination in downtown Boston. Last resort, only to be had on rainy days if you work in 100 Fed. Also - its 2019 (soon to be 2020) should definitely consider getting ApplePay....\n\nThe best part is you get all of this horrific service/food product for 20% greater than the generic lunch option. In hindsight, they should pay the customer for dealing with their persistently poor quality and even worse food.\n\nBailey & Sage (100 Fed) = Trash!! My nominee for worst run business of the year...\nEvery experience seems to prove this store represents a rookie attempt at fast casual dining.\nI've come here close to 20 times during the year, by virtue of them being in the lobby of 100 Federal. If my order wasn't flat out wrong there was usually a random piece of someone else's meal included.\nLook for messy for prep areas, poor store layout, and generally unwelcoming / unhelpful staff. Not to mention $4+ for a bagel with cream cheese that get's toasted in a panini press???\n\nLast resort for employees at 100 Federal on a bad weather day. We were there for a birthday brunch. The food, service and atmosphere are 5 stars. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for so it's worth the few $$$ you spend. Not a good place for young children but I assume it could be a good atmosphere for a romantic dinner date. Maybe the chef was just having a bad day, but honestly, the whole experience felt like it was from a 2-star hotel restaurant.\nHow do you overcook Eggs Benedict\u2014twice? The food tasted almost pre-prepared. When I sent back my first plate, the server didn\u2019t apologize, and a replacement arrived in just five minutes.\nOn the bright side, the vibe and the decor were nice. So, if you're looking for a cute spot with overpriced, mediocre food\u2014like $28 overcooked Eggs Benedict (before tax and tip)\u2014this is the place for you. Nice ambiance with plenty of natural light coming through the semi-clear ceiling, which adds to the atmosphere. The food was decent\u2014I enjoyed my lobster roll and the starter bread. Would visit again. This place was great! We made a reservation but we had to wait a few extra minutes for our table to be ready. To apologize they offered us a complimentary round of mimosas! Additionally, the food was amazing and perfectly cooked and the atmosphere was very classy. Highly recommend!! Had a hotel credit for food and was happy I did! The location and atmosphere can\u2019t be beat. This renovated banks makes an exceptional location for brunch and food in downtown Boston. Prices are high, but the experience is definitely worth it. This was my first time trying Raising Cane's and I really enjoyed it. I got a combo box with 4 tenders, fries and sauce, usually comes with coleslaw as well, but I'm not a big fan of 'slaw', so I got extra fries. The chicken was really delicate and flaky, almost like it was fresh. The fries were, just fries and the toast, didn't even pay attention to it, but it was fresh and crispy on one side, but not the other. The sauce was really good, I even dipped my fries in it and made them a little better. The place is all gold as well because it opened on the 28th of August, so Golden Birthday. Overall, the place was clean, it was busy, but I only waited about 5 minutes for my food and it was good. Overall 7/10, got Eric stamp of approval! i live in europe and i heard a lot about how good raising cane\u2019s was.. and they did not lie !! this is honestly the best fast food ever =D everything was good and i went there multiple times during my trip.\nplease open a raising cane\u2019s in France !!!! I have tried Cane\u2019s at Las Vegas. The decorations are completely different from this Boston Cane\u2019s. Both are about LOVE. The chicken tenders are for sure very tender and fresh. Their Cane\u2019s sauce is the best. Check if they give it to you. It\u2019s a must-have. The crinkle fries are average. The cole slaw is very smooth. The bread is very soft. Next time I\u2019ll try their chicken sandwich.\nStaff are efficient. It\u2019s extremely crowded but you get your food very fast.\n5 stars. It's pretty good food, and priced VERY well. It can be a bit messy to eat, but such is the nature of these things. The music was very loud, as was the restaurant as a whole, which detracted from the experience in my opinion. The price my lure me back here, and the food is good enough to make it worth it. Does anyone do chicken fingers better? This location is awesome because it celebrates Cane\u2019s 28th \u201cGolden Birthday!\u201d\n\nThe entire restaurant is gold!\n\nGold fingers anyone??? lol\u2026 same great taste, quality food, tasty sauce, fun vibe, and more! The review is about the drink quality. I\u2019ve been to other Starbucks, and it\u2019s been fine. This one, it was not. It was a caramel macchiato. It didn\u2019t taste like a caramel macchiato. The first sip I got what appeared to be a slimy oat. Never had that before, but I promise I won\u2019t again. The ones I\u2019ve gone to, I\u2019ll stick to, but never this one again. I love the drinks of Starbucks, but sometimes things, it\u2019s just unacceptable I waited 5 minutes on the line. I was alone, and the two workers that was there, were on the cellphone trying to ignore me. But it\u2019s ok, I just ordered a hot chocolate warm, and some people was coming in for order as well. I waited 10 minutes and people that were behind me got their order first than me, and I just order a hot chocolate, and they gave me hot instead of warm, that I asked very specifically. I love the drink but it\u2019s unacceptable. Most friendly staff of any Starbucks I've ever been too and I've lived all over the country. Shanice is one of the nicest baristas I've ever encountered. Really made me like Starbucks again and gives me hope for the future! The customer service at this Starbucks is the best I\u2019ve ever encountered. I was surprised considering this is a high traffic area but the baristas greeted me immediately when I entered, they asked about my day, and even went so far as to ask if I was okay when there was a man lurking behind me. The lurking man was my husband but never the less I appreciated that they were looking out for me. My drink and food was amazing. Excellent coffee shop to take a break at while roaming around. The guy who took our order and the woman had a terrible attitude and were very mean. Plus we tried using a free pastry and coffee code and they charged us for it. The food tasted like liquid diarea. Got ourselves a couple of large cups of hot chocolate to go on the cold night of Nov 30th with temperatures of 32 degrees outside.. Best decision ever! This place is super esthetic and cozy. The drink was great and didn't take overly long to get. Highly recommend! Super chill location. Luxurious seating options. Friendly staff. Atmosphere was like 7 out of 5. In Downtown Crossing, where fast-fashion chains and smartphone zombies reign supreme, there's a peculiar oasis of faux-Italian charm called Caff\u00e8 Nero. Yes, it's a chain,  the kind that dots every corner of London like pigeons, but this one, wedged into 560 Washington Street, has developed its own strange ecosystem.\n\nThe space is a beautiful bastard child of industrial Boston and European pretension. Exposed brick walls and steel ducts loom above, while below, an almost comically eclectic collection of furniture looks like it was raided from a Victorian estate sale. Leather wingbacks with enough button tufting to make a duchess blush sit next to wooden tables that have seen more MacBooks than actual books.\n\nThe lighting is pure theater: Edison bulbs dangling like costume jewelry, casting that perfect \"I'm-being-productive-in-public\" glow that every freelance writer and remote coder seems to crave. And crave they do. From 6:30 AM on weekdays (7 AM if you're a weekend warrior), the place fills with a parade of caffeinated characters, each claiming their territory with laptops and keep-cup thermoses like urban homesteaders.\n\nThe food? It's surprisingly not terrible. Their display case is a United Nations of grab-and-go options. The Winter Chicken Cobb could actually pass for real food, and their sandwiches, stacked high behind fingerprint-smudged glass, are honest attempts at sustenance rather than the usual sad caf\u00e9 fare. They've even managed to nail that perfect bread consistency that won't tear your gums to shreds, a rare victory in the chain coffee shop sandwich wars.\n\nSpeaking of coffee: yes, they serve it, and yes, it will keep you vertical. But you're not here for a life-changing espresso experience. You're here because it's a reliable port in the storm of downtown Boston, a place where you can camp out with your deadlines and demons until 9 PM (8 PM on Sundays, because even pretend Italians need their rest).\n\nThe whole operation runs with the efficiency of a Swiss train, accepting every form of digital payment known to mankind. There's even outdoor seating, though in Boston's weather, that's more of an occasional perk than a reliable feature.\n\nIs it authentic Italian? About as Italian as my cousin Tony from Revere. But in a city where finding a decent place to sit and think can feel like hunting for parking during a Red Sx game, Caff\u00e8 Nero has carved out its own peculiar niche. It's a place where the old bones of Boston real estate meet the new demands of urban nomads, all wrapped in a comfortable veneer of European caf\u00e9 culture.\n\nAnd maybe that's exactly what this corner of Downtown Crossing needs \u2013 not another sterile coffee franchise, but a space with just enough character and competence to make you forget you're sitting in a chain caf\u00e9, tapping away at your laptop while pretending you're writing the next great American novel.\n\nJust don't expect any revelations in your cappuccino. Those you'll have to find yourself, somewhere between the fake vintage furniture and the very real need for caffeine that brought you here in the first place. I loved Oliver Street Cafe! The bread was wonderful--soft but still with a great chew. It's clear they bake the bread on the premises. I talked with the owner and he's a super nice guy. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice sandwich. I've honestly never had an Italian sub like this one. It will change your life. Fast and tasty. Bread was still warm from the oven. Great sandwiches,good prices. Best subs ever The staff at this coffee shop was quite friendly, which I appreciated.\nWhile the latte didn't quite meet my expectations given the price point, I understand that crafting the perfect cup is an art form.\nThe food offerings were adequate, though there may be room for improvement.\nPerhaps I have high standards when it comes to my coffee experience, but I believe attention to detail can make all the difference. This place has very little parking but is fully accessible and pretty massive inside!\n\nThey have Harney & Sons bottled teas (my favorite), Natalie\u2019s juices, waters, pre-made salads and yogurt, grab-and-go chips, and more.\n\nThey use bagels from Iggies, which, their rolls are phenomenal\u2026the multigrain bagels were the texture of a roll, not a bagel.  Good but not what I want in a bagel.\n\nThe eggs weren\u2019t single eggs, but looked poured from a container, and the avocado is smushed and likely from a jar, not a fresh avocado.\n\nI don\u2019t pushed my sandwich had more cheese too, as the slice was super thin.\n\nOverall it was not a sandwich I\u2019d get again, but I did like the place itself, and would go back to try other things.\n\nIt was also affordable.  My egg sandwich was $8 ish. My friend and put kids came here after the aquarium\nThe was one guy working behind the counter and boy did he kill it got busy suddenly and he was so kind and quick. The Food was awesome and there was a nice big table in the back we could all relax and hangout at? My husband has the best croissant he's ever tasted. Sorelle is a great little coffee shop / bakery in the Seaport area with solid breakfast food and coffee. It was very convenient to visit each morning during our stay at the InterContinental. This bakery is right around the corner from the hotel. Our go to place in Boston to grab some delicious breakfast and coffee . Their sandwich is always fresh and nutritious . My fav is Avocado toast sandwich . If you in Boston and would like to have some healthy  breakfast I will def recommend this bakery !! A cozy coffee shop featuring a fantastic selection of single-origin beans and specialty lattes - the Flannel Latte was one of our fav with well-spiced flavors. Seating here is a bit limited so best to grab your drinks and enjoy on the go. Very good! I had the Guatemala pour-over, which was very sweet with bright acidity, brewed by Ariel. Nick explained everything about the coffee perfectly, and I think this place definitely has many other great coffees! Additionally, I saw many people ordering the espresso tonic, which looked tasty, but one coffee was enough for me today, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to try it. Gracenote is definitely a good place with good vibes and great service. This is what should come to mind when thinking of specialty coffee. Amazing espresso bar, they were brewing a Misty Valley Ethiopian. Tons of light, openness, clean, attention to detail. Everything. Not a lot of room, so not for staying and working for a long time, but a must visit for coffee. This place isn\u2019t just a place to grab coffee. From the moment you walk in, the rich aroma of freshly brewed beans wraps around you like a warm hug.\nThe atmosphere is cozy yet vibrant, and If you love coffee, this place is must visit. High quality coffee and skilled baristas. They have top quality machines and are pulling espresso using scales. They are serious about coffee. Highly recommend. Two story interior, with amazing seating on the second level - perfect for connecting with friends while enjoying the views and beating the Boston elements. Starbucks options are endless, coffee \u2615\ufe0f(duh?!?), snacks, a lil more than a snack \ud83d\ude09, desserts, refreshers and SO much more. LOVE this location! good coffee, and nicest starbucks sitting area i\u2019ve seen! Bonus for cute doodle on my cup and having a ton of outlets We have been staying at a hotel near this Starbucks location for a few days. The service is completely inconsistent ranging from very pleasant to completely rude. Surprisingly, the more pleasant experiences came when the store was busy; left without many customers the staff (different personnel than the busy times) seems to forget they are in a service profession.  I think customers have the right to expect basic politeness and civility.  Not always present at this location. Won't be back. I get it that people who patronize Starbucks can be entitled, but don't start your interaction with a customer that way.  Coffee was standard Starbucks, location is good and actually the architecture is interesting. Just the service is so bad as to make this an avoid. Greeted with that classic northern rudeness.\n\nIt\u2019s a Starbucks but the lady working there acted like I walked in her front door. Demanding I make a purchase to use their amenities. Which included sitting down while using google maps to figure out where I was walking to. The big selling point for Boston News Cafe is that they sell Boar's Head, and the sandwiches that incorporate Boar's Head are great.  But unfortunately, either the meat sits out for too long, or a lot of the other sandwiches don't use Boar's Head... regardless of the sticker they slap on the packaging.\n\nI've had their Chipotle Chicken sandwich twice, as it's one of their specialties.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed with it both times.  While the sauce was creamy, spicy, and flavorful, the chicken was dry and dull.  The food comes out relatively slowly depending on what you order.\n\nI was found the layout and operation a little annoying and off-putting.  There isn't any sort of semblance of a line... it's more of a crowd of people where there's some general understanding of who's been waiting longer.  There's no apparent flow... you order somewhere along the long display case, then pay at an arbitrary cashier station on the other side of the store.  There's no signage or lines to help you out, they just sort of assume you know what to do.\n\nThe confusion is compounded by another problem:  since there is no line or organization, people who have already ordered will stand around waiting in the same spot they ordered in.  So when you walk in during the lunch rush, it's impossible to tell who has ordered, if it's your turn, and how to navigate through the chaos.\n\nTheir business would be significantly improved by simple putting up a divider in front of the display case.  This would create an organized line, people entering on one end, ordering their food, getting their food, then paying at the other.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad place.  The sandwiches are decent (\"A-OK\", as a Yelp 3-star review will say), and it looks very clean.  I come here every now and then for lunch, but never *ever* after 11:45AM.  The earlier you get here, the more chance you'll avoid the hectic lunch rush. This place is the undisputed underated lunch Gem. Get the Chipotle Chicken on cibatta. You will not regret it. These guys dont keep up on their websites or google, it looks alot better in person. Lol. Trust Great spot for takeaway sandwiches and soups. Favorites are white chicken chili for soup and cranberry walnut chicken salad, chicken pesto and caprese sandwiches. They also have a build your own salad option. I walk in at 2pm on Thursday and she says they are closed when the website says closing is at 4pm Amazing sandwiches! Try the tuna melt Lovely little cafe! I went there a few weeks ago and the person there was super friendly. My coffee was great and you can make use of the entire building lobby which makes everything more enjoyable. I also really appreciated that they have a loyalty point system. Beautifully presented, high quality baked goods and drinks. There aren\u2019t any seats in the coffee shop, but a table outside. I loved the jade green tea and cortado but the chocolate chip cookie was mindblowingly amazing. Definitely stop by if you\u2019re nearby! This is a quaint little coffee shop. I got a lavender latte and a K\u014dhi Muffin. Both things were excellent. Great drip and pour over coffees. Quick friendly service. Some nice pastries and good (albeit a bit pricey) whole bean coffee, too.\n\nIf you sign up for their loyalty program (all it takes is a phone number that they associate with your credit card) you'll get 1 free drink for every 10 purchases. If you use that free drink on a nice $5 pour over, that's essentially $0.50 off every coffee, which puts them comparably priced with the big green coffee chain. Such a nice little coffee shop. Very small\u2014would not recommend for doing work\u2014although there is some seating outside in the general lobby area. The espresso is excellent and the drink options are not too overwhelming. The space is bright and clean with a sleek modern design. The guy who took our order and the woman had a terrible attitude and were very mean. Plus we tried using a free pastry and coffee code and they charged us for it. The food tasted like liquid diarea. Got ourselves a couple of large cups of hot chocolate to go on the cold night of Nov 30th with temperatures of 32 degrees outside.. Best decision ever! This place is super esthetic and cozy. The drink was great and didn't take overly long to get. Highly recommend! Super chill location. Luxurious seating options. Friendly staff. Atmosphere was like 7 out of 5. In Downtown Crossing, where fast-fashion chains and smartphone zombies reign supreme, there's a peculiar oasis of faux-Italian charm called Caff\u00e8 Nero. Yes, it's a chain,  the kind that dots every corner of London like pigeons, but this one, wedged into 560 Washington Street, has developed its own strange ecosystem.\n\nThe space is a beautiful bastard child of industrial Boston and European pretension. Exposed brick walls and steel ducts loom above, while below, an almost comically eclectic collection of furniture looks like it was raided from a Victorian estate sale. Leather wingbacks with enough button tufting to make a duchess blush sit next to wooden tables that have seen more MacBooks than actual books.\n\nThe lighting is pure theater: Edison bulbs dangling like costume jewelry, casting that perfect \"I'm-being-productive-in-public\" glow that every freelance writer and remote coder seems to crave. And crave they do. From 6:30 AM on weekdays (7 AM if you're a weekend warrior), the place fills with a parade of caffeinated characters, each claiming their territory with laptops and keep-cup thermoses like urban homesteaders.\n\nThe food? It's surprisingly not terrible. Their display case is a United Nations of grab-and-go options. The Winter Chicken Cobb could actually pass for real food, and their sandwiches, stacked high behind fingerprint-smudged glass, are honest attempts at sustenance rather than the usual sad caf\u00e9 fare. They've even managed to nail that perfect bread consistency that won't tear your gums to shreds, a rare victory in the chain coffee shop sandwich wars.\n\nSpeaking of coffee: yes, they serve it, and yes, it will keep you vertical. But you're not here for a life-changing espresso experience. You're here because it's a reliable port in the storm of downtown Boston, a place where you can camp out with your deadlines and demons until 9 PM (8 PM on Sundays, because even pretend Italians need their rest).\n\nThe whole operation runs with the efficiency of a Swiss train, accepting every form of digital payment known to mankind. There's even outdoor seating, though in Boston's weather, that's more of an occasional perk than a reliable feature.\n\nIs it authentic Italian? About as Italian as my cousin Tony from Revere. But in a city where finding a decent place to sit and think can feel like hunting for parking during a Red Sx game, Caff\u00e8 Nero has carved out its own peculiar niche. It's a place where the old bones of Boston real estate meet the new demands of urban nomads, all wrapped in a comfortable veneer of European caf\u00e9 culture.\n\nAnd maybe that's exactly what this corner of Downtown Crossing needs \u2013 not another sterile coffee franchise, but a space with just enough character and competence to make you forget you're sitting in a chain caf\u00e9, tapping away at your laptop while pretending you're writing the next great American novel.\n\nJust don't expect any revelations in your cappuccino. Those you'll have to find yourself, somewhere between the fake vintage furniture and the very real need for caffeine that brought you here in the first place. Super amazing experience definitely an expensive matcha. But worth it, 9/10 plus the gorgeous atmosphere around makes it very pleasant the matcha is creamy thick and very flavorful. I did order it with 2% milk, they sell it with oatmilk but they use Oatly which was sunflower oil as an ingredient so I prefer not to drink oil. Typically love coming here, good coffee and lowkey vibe. Kind've a hidden gem. However, they've mistakenly made my drink with whole milk three times now. Usually don't realize it til the 3rd sip and then I have to eventually run to the toilet lol. Great place, but very tough to make plans to meet people here when the hours of operation are so inconsistent. It\u2019s happened several times now to me and other people I work with. Online it says they\u2019re open, but you get there and there\u2019s nobody there, customers just standing around wondering if someone\u2019s coming back or if they\u2019re closed. I just visited 2:30pm on a Friday. Google says they are open, but there\u2019s nobody behind the counter, no signage anywhere indicating closed, and the front desk building security saying they haven\u2019t seen anyone for a while. When I arrived there was also a woman standing there who mentioned she\u2019s been waiting for 10 minutes and hasn\u2019t seen anyone. Easy fix would be a sign on the counter when closed / more accurate times on Google. Cappuccino was scalding hot, and bland.  Chocolate croissant was overcooked & stale/dry.  Had to wait 5 minutes for the batista to come back, but she was pleasant.  Space is nice, but a little cold for me (both temperature and atmosphere).  I went because of a previous good experience in Chicago, but $11 was too much for what I got. August 2022:\nStopped by for a drip coffee \u2615 and an oatmeal. The oatmeal is a third party and not their own.\n\nCoffee was really good. It's been over 10+ years since I've had their coffee in Chicago. Definitely before they got bought out by Peet's Coffee.\n\nI'm glad they still select excellent coffee beans and take pride in roasting their beans.\n\nOatmeal was less enjoyable. Probably wouldn't get that again and would try one of their baked goods!

Which included sitting down while using google maps to figure out where I was walking to. The coffee and vibe here is great, lots of people studying at comfy tables and chatting. The breakfast sandwich was absolutely great, the bread was some of the best I\u2019ve had with the sauce and egg, it all just melted together perfectly. Croissant was definitely picture-worthy, wouldn\u2019t get again since there wasn\u2019t really any red velvet flavor, just coloring with some very sweet cream in the middle.\n\nOverall, definitely a recommend for the coffee and savory items! Incredible diamond in the rough. Absolutely perfect coffee and breakfast shop in the heart of the city. Beautiful and delicious pastries and breakfast sandwiches, great coffee and fresh squeezed juice. The decor is warm and open and the staff are actually pleasant and helpful. Great music , energy, and overall vibe. This place puts Starbucks and Panera to shame. Too notch, don\u2019t miss it. Loved, loved, loved this coffee shop! The atmosphere is very cozy and warm with a lot of vintage decor and furniture. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and fast. Their coffee was consistently delicious every time we'd either have breakfast there or had it to go, with lots of savory and sweet food options that are big in size. Very nice place to chill and grab a good coffee and treat. Plenty of seating with leather booths and dark wooden interior. My friend got the red velvet croissant on the recommendation of the barista and then said, \u201cThey weren\u2019t lying, this is fantastic!\u201d Decent coffee, tea and pastries. It\u2019s a nice perk when staying at the Dagny.\n\nMuffins, and scones were alright. Not the best I\u2019ve had but decent at the least. The chocolate croissant on the other hand was not worth it. Paying $7.50 for a chocolate croissant that only had a sliver of chocolate was not expected and the croissant itself was fluffy but not layered/flaky. One rainy evening we were in search of a place that sold pastries. Everything was closed and we stopped a stranger on the street who happened to be the owner of SIP. Although their restaurant had just closed, there was a worker in the shop. They opened the doors for us and loaded us up with a bag full of amazing pastries! Thank you Ted! We appreciate your kindness and have an even bigger love for Boston! Sip is a delightful destination. It's quite popular, convenient to the Financial District in Post Office Square, not far from anything, really (this IS Boston)... Not having lunched there, I don't have much to say about the food, but they do have a beguiling assortment of goodies near the register, and are quick on the beverage orders. The main attraction for us is the location and situation, occupying the corner of a beautiful miniature version of Columbus Park, a bit reminiscent of Bryant Park in NY without the insanity, a bejeweled green space oasis surrounded by towers of glass, stone and concrete.\nIt's a really terrific experience, especially on a nice day...and they are KIND here. I accidentally dumped an Iced Latte, and they happily replaced it without even being asked. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f I ordered an iced latte and it was so good. They have a beautiful inside and an even better outdoor seating area. I loved that some of their indoor tables had games which made for a fun activity while drinking my coffee. Would definitely come back! I found this randomly and I loved it! It\u2019s a nice surprise in a very lovely area.\nPeople were all friendly and the espresso was good (not amazing, but still good). Plenty of seats inside and outside. I\u2019ll surely go back. Beautiful cafe location with reasonably priced food and drink. Probably the best pumpkin latte I've ever had! The breakfast sandwich was delicious too! This coffee shop is ideal for a quick, high-quality coffee fix. With speedy service and a focus on grab-and-go options, it's perfect for those on the move. The spacious seating area provides a comfortable environment to enjoy your drink. Plus, the convenience of accepting credit cards makes transactions hassle-free. As someone who is from Philadelphia that has moved to Boston I\u2019m very happy to see La Colombe coffee shops here.\n\nI used to walk to the Rittenhouse everyday for their coffee and I must say this location did not disappoint! Wonderful coffee as always, so not surprised there.\n\nStaff was attentive, kind, and a joy to interact with. Also, this location was not as busy so we got our coffee fast!\n\nDon\u2019t pass this place up! La Colombe has hands down the best nitro cold brew I have ever had. I specifically love the nitro latte brew on tap. The foam is dense and the flavor is BUSSIN.\n\nTheir ham and cheese croissants are great and they have a wide selection of baked goods. They also have brewed coffee, express drinks, cold brew, cappuccinos, flash cooled cold brew and other drinks. They also have sparkling and still water on tap along with free oat, regular milk, and simply service for your brewed coffee.\n\nLastly, they have unlocked bathrooms. If you\u2019re looking for a rare coffee experience La Colombe is one of the best places to start. I highly recommend their rich blend cold brew. But even the darker hot blends are smooth and rich.\n\nIt has a decent amount of seating for a small neighborhood cafe (Leather District across from South Station), which makes it a good place to work. But\u2014at least the last time I was there\u2014they didn\u2019t provide Internet. Perhaps they\u2019ve changed.\n\nThe prices are a bit high ($3 for a small hot coffee), but its well worth the guilty pleasure.  For coffee fans, it\u2019s a must visit! I like this place because of what it ISN\u2019T:\nCoffee as a fast food dispensary location. It\u2019s dreadful to me how rare it is to see someone enjoy the experience of calmly having a coffee IN A COFFEE SHOP compared to the masses of consumers waiting at mobile app pickup counters, to-go lines filled with headphone wearing, non interactive individuals, drive through windows, etc. I\u2019m sure La Colombe sells plenty of coffee to go as well, but I appreciated getting my in house cortado served to me in a shot glass instead of a paper cup with a print out label pasted on the side. More places like this please Worst Philly steak I\u2019ve ever had in my life ground beef was salty and don\u2019t fall forthe menu because is not what they describe they advertised it\u2019s steak but is not is ground beef. I feel like I wasted my money. Tastes horrible. I had breakfast here before getting on my train and it was a great decision.\nThey were a little busy but the line was moving steadily which was good. I ordered the bagel with lox and cream cheese and it was a great choice.\nIt was a good amount of food for a great price and the sodas were also reasonably priced so I grabbed a couple for the train ride. Melting Sun at south station offered decent breakast with quick service. The chocolate chop muffin and crossaint were delicious. The cookie was a bit too rough for my likely. The service was really nice and polite. The prices went up $2.50-$3.00 for a sandwich within a week, and, the size of the muffins got significantly smaller for $3.90 and how they are packed for take out are far worse than a week before or compared to the recent visits in the past year.\n\nIs the ownership changed? Why did he change once the great team to slow and silent young guys behind the counter? Especially the cashier? He wasted bags and and extremely slow. Look at how he packed 4 muffins. Instead of giving us 2 small paper bags in the past.\n\nTheir sandwiches are not much better any more for the comparable price point. And the flavors are not the same any more just lately.\n\nAlso don't pile up boxes outside the stall. The outside starts to look dingy and unkempt. Service was good but the iced coffee was 90% ice and milk with no coffee in it. If the coffee had been good it would have been 5 stars.\n\nWould have asked them to remake it if I didn\u2019t have to get on the train Love coming here for my morning coffee because they are very welcoming and sometimes have new drinks to try while you wait. Good service and typical Starbucks coffee It is spacious, clean, and has ample seating. There is also power at the tables. Staffs were very friendly and excellent service. Dropped in for a drip coffee and ended up with a pour over that was superb.  The manager, Ha, even gave me a couple samples of coffees brewed using the new Clover machines. Exceptional service! Shout-out to this amazing Starbucks crew that delivers exactly what you ordered with a smile. It\u2019s by far one of the busiest locations in Boston for a reason!! I especially appreciate the extra foam on my cold brew!! 5+/5 The store manager here, Ha, makes this location feel like a small-town coffee shop. Always stellar. Xelsie was fabulous and kind. She greeted me as I entered, was very friendly when I purchased my drink.\nMy order was called and the barista and Xelsie notified me that they garnished my Matcha frappe with some dusting of Matcha. I absolutely loved it! In the past 9 years of ordering this drink, I\u2019ve never had my Matcha Frappe garnished with some Matcha dusting.\nThe place was wicked clean, everything was well-stocked, and I enjoyed chatting with the staff. One of my favorite Starbucks in Boston! Staff knows my name and order, which makes things easier. Grayson just made my morning. Super friendly and great energy. The tea was piping hot\u2026 as it should be!\n\nThank you! Fantastic spot, for one very important reason: wireless chargers. This Starbucks has wireless charging pads at all its seats, and if your phone doesn't support wireless charging, they'll lend you a key-like device that enables wireless charging for your phone. Great spot to catch a breath and recharge (literally!). Of the several Starbucks in the immediate vacinity (there are at least four within five minutes from each other), this one is my favorite.\n\nIt's always clean, it's always fast, and the staff is always friendly.  They've never gotten my order wrong.\n\nThey don't have as much food as the others, and there's not much sitting room. It's for quickly ordering a drink and leaving with it.\n\nWhen I go around my usual 12:30-1PM, there is almost never a line.  I'm in and out in two minutes. Food here is really good, the spring rolls were delicious and fresh. Hibiscus iced tea was pretty good and they made it without sugar when I asked which was pretty nice. The chai was really good as well. The only disappointing thing was that they were out of matcha when we went but if I\u2019m in the downtown area again I would love to come back to try their matcha and anything else on their menu as well. I visited this nice Vietnamese cafe during my Boston trip. The place was bustling yet maintained a bright and clean atmosphere, and the staff were super friendly.I am usually very picky about coffee, but it was a pleasant surprise to see the varieties of specialty coffee-based and matcha-based drinks. I came here twice, on the first trip, I tried the iced Boston cream latte and immediately loved it --- slightly sweeter and creamier than usual iced latte but absolutely delicious, then I also tried the citrus espresso, a uniquely flavorful, strong drink that left a lasting impression. I returned a few days later to try the matcha ube latte. It too was fantastic, perfectly blending the distinct flavors of matcha and ube. I highly recommend this place. I absolutely love love love this cafe! Already being a fan of Asian food and a cafe fanatic, this place is the place for me!\nI\u2019ll definitely keep coming back. The food is high quality, and so are the drinks. Love their affogato! and people are very nice :) Really popular cafe, it was 2 pm on Tuesday and the place was packed. I wanted to get hot ube latte but they told me that they ran out of ube.\n\nSo instead I got their ca phe phin in small size. I love the coffee, it\u2019s like iced latte but stronger in flavor and smooth with frothy layer. My only complaint is that the size small was $6.21 and half of it is ice soooooo I think it\u2019s better to get this in bigger size or get hot drinks instead.\n\nThey have several 2-people tables and seatings so it\u2019s a great place to work or meet with a friend if you guys don\u2019t mind the bustle and overall loud chatter. The avocado toast with perfectly boiled eggs is beautifully presented and looks absolutely delicious! The creamy avocado spread, paired with the savory eggs and a drizzle of sauce, is both fresh and appetizing. The colorful side salad adds a nice, healthy touch to the dish. A well-balanced meal for any time of the day! A cozy coffee shop featuring a fantastic selection of single-origin beans and specialty lattes - the Flannel Latte was one of our fav with well-spiced flavors. Seating here is a bit limited so best to grab your drinks and enjoy on the go. Very good! I had the Guatemala pour-over, which was very sweet with bright acidity, brewed by Ariel. Nick explained everything about the coffee perfectly, and I think this place definitely has many other great coffees! Additionally, I saw many people ordering the espresso tonic, which looked tasty, but one coffee was enough for me today, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to try it. Gracenote is definitely a good place with good vibes and great service. This is what should come to mind when thinking of specialty coffee. Amazing espresso bar, they were brewing a Misty Valley Ethiopian. Tons of light, openness, clean, attention to detail. Everything. Not a lot of room, so not for staying and working for a long time, but a must visit for coffee. This place isn\u2019t just a place to grab coffee. From the moment you walk in, the rich aroma of freshly brewed beans wraps around you like a warm hug.\nThe atmosphere is cozy yet vibrant, and If you love coffee, this place is must visit. High quality coffee and skilled baristas. They have top quality machines and are pulling espresso using scales. They are serious about coffee. Highly recommend. Highly recommend if you are in this neighborhood. Came alone on a weekday morning and ordered right away. Waited only a short while before it came out. Food was absolutely delicious and service was great. I got a blood orange iced tea and the halloumi breakfast sandwich + sausage. The best part was the freshly baked ciabatta roll it was on. There is nothing like freshly baked bread. So hard to resist one of their incredible looking pastries. Would definitely come back! The almond croissant I ordered was dry, they have a nice selection of a ton of pastries though. I also got an americano and it was decent. High quality backery and breakfast restaurant.\nA must to visit.\nHigh quality ingredients.\nVery Joyful atmosphere.\nVery polite helpful staff.\nLots of backed sweet and savory fine pastries.\nSome freshly backed pies.\nLots of cake selections.\nLots of choices of delicious sandwiches and hot plates (like shakshoka).\nBeautiful presentation.\nLarge portions.\nTasty coffee choices.\nRegular tables or high chair.\nReasonable prices.\nHighly recommended. Really great place to grab a quick bite to eat before heading out for a day of exploring. We loved it so much the first day, we found another location to start our second day!\nSandwiches were great as was the house latte I got both days! We loved this place! I was visiting Boston with my family and this Tatte was very close to our hotel in Downtown. It\u2019s spacious and great atmosphere. Everything we ordered was phenomenal! The pear labneh it\u2019s out of this world and one of the best things I\u2019ve had. Coffee is great (and that\u2019s not something I say easily). We has a small problem with an order but the manager and the staff were so quick to fix it and were so polite. I would recommend this Tatte to anyone! Ans hopefully you guys open a location in Miami This coffee shop is ideal for a quick, high-quality coffee fix. With speedy service and a focus on grab-and-go options, it's perfect for those on the move. The spacious seating area provides a comfortable environment to enjoy your drink. Plus, the convenience of accepting credit cards makes transactions hassle-free. As someone who is from Philadelphia that has moved to Boston I\u2019m very happy to see La Colombe coffee shops here.\n\nI used to walk to the Rittenhouse everyday for their coffee and I must say this location did not disappoint! Wonderful coffee as always, so not surprised there.\n\nStaff was attentive, kind, and a joy to interact with. Also, this location was not as busy so we got our coffee fast!\n\nDon\u2019t pass this place up! La Colombe has hands down the best nitro cold brew I have ever had. I specifically love the nitro latte brew on tap. The foam is dense and the flavor is BUSSIN.\n\nTheir ham and cheese croissants are great and they have a wide selection of baked goods. They also have brewed coffee, express drinks, cold brew, cappuccinos, flash cooled cold brew and other drinks. They also have sparkling and still water on tap along with free oat, regular milk, and simply service for your brewed coffee.\n\nLastly, they have unlocked bathrooms. If you\u2019re looking for a rare coffee experience La Colombe is one of the best places to start. I highly recommend their rich blend cold brew. But even the darker hot blends are smooth and rich.\n\nIt has a decent amount of seating for a small neighborhood cafe (Leather District across from South Station), which makes it a good place to work. But\u2014at least the last time I was there\u2014they didn\u2019t provide Internet. Perhaps they\u2019ve changed.\n\nThe prices are a bit high ($3 for a small hot coffee), but its well worth the guilty pleasure.  For coffee fans, it\u2019s a must visit! I like this place because of what it ISN\u2019T:\nCoffee as a fast food dispensary location. It\u2019s dreadful to me how rare it is to see someone enjoy the experience of calmly having a coffee IN A COFFEE SHOP compared to the masses of consumers waiting at mobile app pickup counters, to-go lines filled with headphone wearing, non interactive individuals, drive through windows, etc. I\u2019m sure La Colombe sells plenty of coffee to go as well, but I appreciated getting my in house cortado served to me in a shot glass instead of a paper cup with a print out label pasted on the side. More places like this please Worst Philly steak I\u2019ve ever had in my life ground beef was salty and don\u2019t fall forthe menu because is not what they describe they advertised it\u2019s steak but is not is ground beef. I feel like I wasted my money. Tastes horrible. I had breakfast here before getting on my train and it was a great decision.\nThey were a little busy but the line was moving steadily which was good. I ordered the bagel with lox and cream cheese and it was a great choice.\nIt was a good amount of food for a great price and the sodas were also reasonably priced so I grabbed a couple for the train ride. Melting Sun at south station offered decent breakast with quick service. The chocolate chop muffin and crossaint were delicious. The cookie was a bit too rough for my likely. The service was really nice and polite. The prices went up $2.50-$3.00 for a sandwich within a week, and, the size of the muffins got significantly smaller for $3.90 and how they are packed for take out are far worse than a week before or compared to the recent visits in the past year.\n\nIs the ownership changed? Why did he change once the great team to slow and silent young guys behind the counter? Especially the cashier? He wasted bags and and extremely slow. Look at how he packed 4 muffins. Instead of giving us 2 small paper bags in the past.\n\nTheir sandwiches are not much better any more for the comparable price point. And the flavors are not the same any more just lately.\n\nAlso don't pile up boxes outside the stall. The outside starts to look dingy and unkempt. Service was good but the iced coffee was 90% ice and milk with no coffee in it. If the coffee had been good it would have been 5 stars.\n\nWould have asked them to remake it if I didn\u2019t have to get on the train Love coming here for my morning coffee because they are very welcoming and sometimes have new drinks to try while you wait. Good service and typical Starbucks coffee It is spacious, clean, and has ample seating. There is also power at the tables. Staffs were very friendly and excellent service. Dropped in for a drip coffee and ended up with a pour over that was superb.  The manager, Ha, even gave me a couple samples of coffees brewed using the new Clover machines. Exceptional service! Shout-out to this amazing Starbucks crew that delivers exactly what you ordered with a smile. It\u2019s by far one of the busiest locations in Boston for a reason!! I especially appreciate the extra foam on my cold brew!! 5+/5 The store manager here, Ha, makes this location feel like a small-town coffee shop. Always stellar. Xelsie was fabulous and kind. She greeted me as I entered, was very friendly when I purchased my drink.\nMy order was called and the barista and Xelsie notified me that they garnished my Matcha frappe with some dusting of Matcha. I absolutely loved it! In the past 9 years of ordering this drink, I\u2019ve never had my Matcha Frappe garnished with some Matcha dusting.\nThe place was wicked clean, everything was well-stocked, and I enjoyed chatting with the staff. One of my favorite Starbucks in Boston! Staff knows my name and order, which makes things easier. Grayson just made my morning. Super friendly and great energy. The tea was piping hot\u2026 as it should be!\n\nThank you! Fantastic spot, for one very important reason: wireless chargers. This Starbucks has wireless charging pads at all its seats, and if your phone doesn't support wireless charging, they'll lend you a key-like device that enables wireless charging for your phone. Great spot to catch a breath and recharge (literally!). Of the several Starbucks in the immediate vacinity (there are at least four within five minutes from each other), this one is my favorite.\n\nIt's always clean, it's always fast, and the staff is always friendly.  They've never gotten my order wrong.\n\nThey don't have as much food as the others, and there's not much sitting room. It's for quickly ordering a drink and leaving with it.\n\nWhen I go around my usual 12:30-1PM, there is almost never a line.  I'm in and out in two minutes. Food here is really good, the spring rolls were delicious and fresh. Hibiscus iced tea was pretty good and they made it without sugar when I asked which was pretty nice. The chai was really good as well. The only disappointing thing was that they were out of matcha when we went but if I\u2019m in the downtown area again I would love to come back to try their matcha and anything else on their menu as well. I visited this nice Vietnamese cafe during my Boston trip. The place was bustling yet maintained a bright and clean atmosphere, and the staff were super friendly.I am usually very picky about coffee, but it was a pleasant surprise to see the varieties of specialty coffee-based and matcha-based drinks. I came here twice, on the first trip, I tried the iced Boston cream latte and immediately loved it --- slightly sweeter and creamier than usual iced latte but absolutely delicious, then I also tried the citrus espresso, a uniquely flavorful, strong drink that left a lasting impression. I returned a few days later to try the matcha ube latte. It too was fantastic, perfectly blending the distinct flavors of matcha and ube. I highly recommend this place. I absolutely love love love this cafe! Already being a fan of Asian food and a cafe fanatic, this place is the place for me!\nI\u2019ll definitely keep coming back. The food is high quality, and so are the drinks. Love their affogato! and people are very nice :) Really popular cafe, it was 2 pm on Tuesday and the place was packed. I wanted to get hot ube latte but they told me that they ran out of ube.\n\nSo instead I got their ca phe phin in small size. I love the coffee, it\u2019s like iced latte but stronger in flavor and smooth with frothy layer. My only complaint is that the size small was $6.21 and half of it is ice soooooo I think it\u2019s better to get this in bigger size or get hot drinks instead.\n\nThey have several 2-people tables and seatings so it\u2019s a great place to work or meet with a friend if you guys don\u2019t mind the bustle and overall loud chatter. The avocado toast with perfectly boiled eggs is beautifully presented and looks absolutely delicious! The creamy avocado spread, paired with the savory eggs and a drizzle of sauce, is both fresh and appetizing. The colorful side salad adds a nice, healthy touch to the dish. A well-balanced meal for any time of the day! A cozy coffee shop featuring a fantastic selection of single-origin beans and specialty lattes - the Flannel Latte was one of our fav with well-spiced flavors. Seating here is a bit limited so best to grab your drinks and enjoy on the go. Very good! I had the Guatemala pour-over, which was very sweet with bright acidity, brewed by Ariel. Nick explained everything about the coffee perfectly, and I think this place definitely has many other great coffees! Additionally, I saw many people ordering the espresso tonic, which looked tasty, but one coffee was enough for me today, so I didn\u2019t get a chance to try it. Gracenote is definitely a good place with good vibes and great service. This is what should come to mind when thinking of specialty coffee. Amazing espresso bar, they were brewing a Misty Valley Ethiopian. Tons of light, openness, clean, attention to detail. Everything. Not a lot of room, so not for staying and working for a long time, but a must visit for coffee. This place isn\u2019t just a place to grab coffee. From the moment you walk in, the rich aroma of freshly brewed beans wraps around you like a warm hug.\nThe atmosphere is cozy yet vibrant, and If you love coffee, this place is must visit. High quality coffee and skilled baristas. They have top quality machines and are pulling espresso using scales. They are serious about coffee. Highly recommend. Highly recommend if you are in this neighborhood. Came alone on a weekday morning and ordered right away. Waited only a short while before it came out. Food was absolutely delicious and service was great. I got a blood orange iced tea and the halloumi breakfast sandwich + sausage. The best part was the freshly baked ciabatta roll it was on. There is nothing like freshly baked bread. So hard to resist one of their incredible looking pastries. Would definitely come back! The almond croissant I ordered was dry, they have a nice selection of a ton of pastries though. I also got an americano and it was decent. High quality backery and breakfast restaurant.\nA must to visit.\nHigh quality ingredients.\nVery Joyful atmosphere.\nVery polite helpful staff.\nLots of backed sweet and savory fine pastries.\nSome freshly backed pies.\nLots of cake selections.\nLots of choices of delicious sandwiches and hot plates (like shakshoka).\nBeautiful presentation.\nLarge portions.\nTasty coffee choices.\nRegular tables or high chair.\nReasonable prices.\nHighly recommended. Really great place to grab a quick bite to eat before heading out for a day of exploring. We loved it so much the first day, we found another location to start our second day!\nSandwiches were great as was the house latte I got both days! We loved this place! I was visiting Boston with my family and this Tatte was very close to our hotel in Downtown. It\u2019s spacious and great atmosphere. Everything we ordered was phenomenal! The pear labneh it\u2019s out of this world and one of the best things I\u2019ve had. Coffee is great (and that\u2019s not something I say easily). We has a small problem with an order but the manager and the staff were so quick to fix it and were so polite. I would recommend this Tatte to anyone! Ans hopefully you guys open a location in Miami Staff were lovely - bar was very fun.\nWas not very crowded when we went but would go back if there was a good band playing Great big bar and very spacious. Toilets are clean and large so you\u2019re not queuing. Food was quick and super tasty. Staff are constantly looking for service and the live band are great.  Best bar I\u2019ve been to in Boston so far. Wanted a fun, chill night out in Boston listening to some live music\u2026.. O my how our expectations were blown! Everything about this bar war great, service was quick, super clean restrooms and even the prices were relatively cheap (for beers at least). And the band, don\u2019t get me started, what an absolute banger of a performance, I fell a little bit in love with each individual performer because dang they were talented! Danced and sang along the whole night until we could\u2019t anymore. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone from the ages of 21, to my parents age of 65 howled so much here it was so awesome also got hit on by scary russian men but we told them we were lesbians and they left us alone and then they gave us cigarettes there was also a cool bald guy and we did the substance here so pretty crazy night tbh My friends and I booked a table at Howl at the Moon for my birthday and we had a blast! The service staff were extremely attentive and the whole experience was hassle free from start to finish. We also spend sometime downstairs at Down but we truly loved the up stair experience with live music. We had a blast and we thank Julia and her whole team for making it such a great experience! Solid choice for an upscale bar experience with decent food and drinks.\n\nWhen The Fed opened a few years back, it stirred up plenty of hype after being named one of the best cocktail bars in the nation. I missed it during its initial hype, but recently had the chance to drop by for drinks and dinner. While it didn\u2019t quite have the grandeur of Grana, it offered a similar touch of luxury with cozy couches circling the central square bar\u2014plush, stylish, and perfect for unwinding in style.\n\nAs expected, the menu here felt a bit overpriced, though pretty typical for a 5-star hotel restaurant. However, the food quality didn\u2019t quite live up to its reputation. They stuck to classic dishes without any interesting twists in ingredients or sauces\u2014perhaps a bit too simple for items like the Fed Burger, Lobster Roll, and Crab Cakes. Honestly, they weren\u2019t much different from what you\u2019d find at upscale taverns around the city but came with a higher price tag.\n\nThe fries, lightly dusted with Old Bay seasoning, were a nice touch and probably my favorite part of the entr\u00e9es. The burger was decent, though lacking in veggie toppings, and the patty leaned a bit dry. The Pork Belly Bites and Clam Chowder were our favorites\u2014especially the chowder, which is hard to get wrong.\nThe cocktail menu offered some interesting and creative options, but the execution was just okay. As for the service, it was probably the biggest letdown\u2014after taking our order, our server was MIA until we flagged him down for the check.\n\nWhile the Financial District doesn\u2019t have a lot of cocktail bars, I\u2019m not sure this would be my go-to spot even if I\u2019m in the area. For a better experience, I\u2019d recommend heading to Vermilion Club instead. I walked in and was pleasantly surprised that there were a few people here on a Saturday at 5:30pm in January. The Malbec from Menzona was fantastic. The burger was also very good too. I will return here this summer. Located within the Langham hotel, I had a wonderful meal at the Fed. The restaurant is stunningly beautiful, the service was outstanding, and the food was really good. I had some of the best oysters ever. Needless to say, I highly recommend the Fed if you're looking for a nice sophisticated drink and/or a quick meal in the lounge or at the bar. This place is top-notch! The Fed at The Langham, Boston offers a nice atmosphere, good food, and reasonably good service. Our orders were made as requested and served in a timely manner.\n\nFull Review:\nLocated at The Langham, Boston, The Fed offers a delightful dining experience with its nice atmosphere, good food, and reasonably good service. The restaurant lives up to its description as a British-inspired cocktail bar with a sophisticated New England twist.\n\nOn our visit, we found the surrounding environment to be pleasant, reflecting the quality settings that The Langham is known for. The Fed, much like the hotel's Grana, provides an inviting atmosphere that enhances the overall dining experience.\n\nWe sampled a variety of dishes, including the lobster roll, burger, and steak frites, all of which were delicious and well-prepared. Our orders were made as requested and served in due time, showcasing the kitchen's quality and attention to detail.\n\nWhile we did encounter a minor issue with the hostess, the situation was quickly addressed and rectified by the management. The quality customer service we received in resolving this matter was commendable, and we appreciated the professionalism displayed by the staff.\n\nOverall, our experience at The Fed was enjoyable, and we would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality dining experience in Boston. The combination of a nice atmosphere, good food, and reasonable service makes The Fed a worthy dining destination. 4/5.\n\n---\n\nYou can find me on Insta: @imdanielyoon I have mixed feelings about this bar. Went during their busy time and had fantastic cocktails. We wanted to order food but our waiter disappeared for 30 minutes. Manager comped our drinks. I will have to come back at another time because the vibe and drinks were 10/10"

    "reviews": "Didn\u2019t help me at all for well over 6 months. Ignored my calls, never responded when I needed help and told me they were giving up on me. Do not go see Dr Spector or the recently promoted Dr Plaut. I urge all to avoid them and this hospital. Horrible hospital the nurses in the er are rude and ignore you like your not important the psychiatric part I would say is great but I would not recommend going to the er there To all the people that's was helping my sister Joy she did it. A special appreciation to Dr Vecchiotti your the best 10k\ud83c\udf1f for you. After finally settling down back home I wanted to make sure I thanked the Angels that cared for my little Lily the days she was hospitalized. Nurse Sue (Susan) (and Katie who we only got to share a short time this time around) I could not put into appropriate words how fortunate and blessed I feel to have had the chance of meeting you. You are an exceptional person, the kindness you have shown Lily and I is way more than we could ever expect. I was so worried and frankly terrified about the procedure my daughter needed, and having you explain the entire process and also advocate for us really made it so much easier to cope. Although I hope to never have to see you in the hospital as a patient again, I do hope our paths due cross again and I'm able to get you a coffee and in some way return the kindness. All staff are so amazing and soooo helpful!! My baby got SOOOOO much more care then i expected! All of the nurses and doctors are so nice and show so much love/care to the children \ud83d\udc95 also they are so helpful to the parents/guardians and make sure we are also taken well care of and get rest. Definitely the best hospital i have ever been to! I finally get to take my little one home without worries !\ud83e\udd70 100% recommend!! I had a very good experience at M. Steinert.  I was there to trade in a Boston baby grand that I puchased through them years ago, and wanted to upgrade to a Steinway.  They were helpful in the selection of a new piano and I eventually went with a Spirio after a very fair trade, and I've enjoyed it very much.  They have tuned my pianos for a decade, and I am pleased that the first two tunings of the new piano are complimentary.  They have always been receptive to my questions and phone calls during the buying process and at other times of the year when I was just calling about tunings. We got both our grand pianos from M. Steinert and both times, the experiences were good. We bought a Boston grand 178 in 2005 and they have a great upgrade program so we just upgraded to a Santos Rosewood Model A Steinway grand in September. I've enjoyed our dealings with M. Steinert over the years and got a referral for an awesome piano tuner from them, Bill Faller, who has taken care of the previous grand and the current one. No complaints here. If you pay for a Steinway grand, you get a Steinway celebration at your home at no cost to you with a Steinway artist. Can't think of any other piano dealer that would do that. I had an excellent experience purchasing an acoustic Boston piano from M. Steinert & Sons! Len Giatas was my salesperson and he is extremely knowledgeable on pianos, plus he plays beautifully. He was really patient as I tried out different pianos and asked a lot of questions. He introduced pianos that are most suited for my need and play style. He even went all the way from Boston to Natick as there was a moving sale there. Really appreciated his professionalism and he makes it a wonderful experience for me and my husband. Sales person was kind, but not knowledgeable about the product.  The piano was damaged on delivery.  I was told they would come and fix it and tune it after one month.  No call or contact.  I called and left a message.  No returned phone call.  I finally got one of the owners on the phone.  He read to me what the person who delivered the piano said.  \"Small dent, the owner will probably forget it is there.\"  It seems he had no intention of ever sending someone out to fix it.  I got a call to schedule a tuning.  The woman said she would send a confirmation email.  She did not.\n\nIn summary I feel like I've been given poor information, ignored and forgotten.  When one spends over $20,000 on what is suppose to be the best product line in the world and the service is worse than McDonald's it leaves a bitter taste. The clerks are basically quite polite and kind while there were some wrong reviews so far. I could try some electronic pianos and acoustic pianos after I asked if I could do that. As someone said, some pianos are not tuned well, but I think it is not efficient for the store to always do tuning low-end model because tuning gets wrong after transportation to a customer's home and I think the store's policy is reasonable. High-end models are tuned well. Note that I did not buy them, just did window shopping. As long as I did window shopping, I felt the store was good. For your information, I played following tunes as the trial, and my piano performance level is like those:\n- M. Clementi, Sonatina op. 36-3\n- M. Clementi, Sonatina op. 36-6\n- W. A. Mozart, Sonata K. 545\n- L. V. Beethoven, Sonata 20, op 49-2 I didn't expect it, but the hop on hop off trolley yours ended up being the highlight of the trip.  What I thought was gonna be basically a bus service between spots ended up being informative and fun.  All your tour guides/drivers were great, with 2 of them really standing out (one was a younger African American who was just so fun - wish I took note of his name).  Next time I'm in Boston, I will definitely use your company again. We really enjoyed being able to get a taste of Boston without having to navigate the city on our own. The driver was entertaining, knowledgeable, kind and helpful! The hop on hop off feature was great for being able to more deeply explore areas of interest. This was more than worth the money. I\u2019ve used this trolley company before in Savannah GA and I\u2019ll use them again if the opportunity presents itself. We had a lot of fun on this bus in Boston with our driver, Cogs. He was a real character. Interesting commentary and good choices for stops. Good way to get an overview of the city. Overall, a great experience. It would have been a 5/5 if one driver (Twin) had not almost left us despite me and my friend standing directly under the correct sign. Twin pulled further up (due to cars being illegally parked) and open the door for quite literally two seconds. After yelling for his attention, he stopped again and we boarded but instead of apologizing, blamed us as if we should\u2019ve ran to the bus in two seconds. If Twin isn\u2019t your driver, you\u2019re in for a great experience! My wife and I are new to Boston and had never been on a trolley tour. My daughter who lives here suggested that we take the entire Tour all the way around so we could see if there was anything that we actually wanted to visit later that day or on the next day. We started the tour after a subway ride to Beacon Hill. We were fortunate and have fair weather and sunny skies. At Beacon Hill on the west side is the golden dome State House and the trolley pick up is an inconspicuous sign on the opposite side of the street. While the trolley touts a 15 to 20 minute interval you can occasionally expect 30 minutes to an hour depending upon traffic. We enjoyed several different drivers that had varying degrees of humor and historical knowledge. We both found the driving tour to be enjoyable. We recommend anyone coming to Boston give this to her a try, to see some sites and to get a better idea of what you might like to spend time getting a more thorough visit to. We ended up following the Freedom Trail around the historic part of downtown, spent time in the open markets and on the wharf and spent some time in the beautiful parks and local shops. We ended up with a good many photographs of historical items and images of architecture. We would definitely consider utilizing this trolley or another when coming back to Boston I didn't expect it, but the hop on hop off trolley yours ended up being the highlight of the trip.

We would definitely consider utilizing this trolley or another when coming back to Boston This CVS is my favorite CVS in Boston and there are two incredible people there that need a raise one of them is Eric hard-working guy who would be an awesome assistant manager and a nice raise to go with it! The other one is Tom one of the managers who I feel deserves a raise as well! I've been a CVS customer for quite a while! And I really love the people of the Stuart Street CVS! These people are incredible! There are really good CVS's in Boston in my opinion this is a great CVS you're ever in Boston and you want to go to a CVS go to this one and tell them Ritchie sent you!\ud83d\ude00 CVS corporate needs to get on the stick and give these two guys a raise and a position change! If this doesn't happen I will be writing about it! Remember that saying the customer is always right? Well the customer's definitely right about this CVS! I appreciate your hard work and I appreciate your willingness to help me if I need something? The best CVS I have ever been to and I'm so thankful I found out about them about 6 months ago wasn't even aware they were there! I'm glad I know now! This whole store needs to be recognized for its employees! I want CVS corporate to look into this store and start appreciating these people even more! Because this writer and this customer definitely does I'm so glad God led me to this place! I like a couple of the other CVS's in Boston but this is my favorite!\ud83d\ude00 CVS Health has many benefits because it provides health care services for anyone who needs it and is available for everyone who wants to buy some health goods or other products related to their health needs and services!  I would recommend getting your Health Care Insurance Plan approved prior to coming into the pharmacy because they have to make sure that your insurance company will cover your medical expenses!  Otherwise they have a pretty good deal of information about medical care products that are available for patients to purchase! I definitely recommend this CVS the staff are amazing and caring   One of the staff member named Elle was very nice he helped me to find a pair of gloves and he\u2019s put me my hand warmers inside the next day I came back to buy a new hand warmers and he has the same nice attitude and offer me a box of sanitizer and first care products  i definitely recommend this CVS Why the pharmacy staff can\u2019t stagger their lunch breaks is beyond me. There should always be a pharmacist available during the total pharmacy hours. Also, an obscene amount of products are under lock and key. It shouldn\u2019t be such a to-do to pick up prescriptions or deodorant. The pharmacist was awesome. She was really friendly and very helpful!!!! Thank you \ud83d\ude0a The process was easy. Went in for dry cleaning and one of my coats was missing three buttons, and they fixed it for me when I went to pick it up. They went out of their way to make sure it was repaired, which was really nice of them to do NEVER bring your clothes here for repair. I brought a nice jacket to fix the inside that got broken. They added a horrible white stripe to bring ends together with a very poor sewing quality. Don\u2019t bring your clothing here for repairs or you will be sorry and still you would have to pay for a very poor job. If you are visiting Boston, for the love of god don\u2019t pay your hotel $4 per sock to wash and fold! Check out a local dry cleaner with laundry service like Bay Village and make sure they charge by the lb. Great service and price! Don\u2019t get ripped off by your overpriced hotel concierge! Been coming here for nearly 10 years, mostly for dry cleaning designer clothes. They do a great job. We tried 4 different dry cleaners in the Back Bay before finding them, and the comparative quality of this place is outstanding. No chemical smells like a lot of other places. So thankful to have found them. Easily best laundry service in area. Very friendly and well priced! The garage lets you in when there is no parking spots available. There were many cars circling the garage, wasting their time   It seems like a simple thing to count the cars going in and out and know whether you have space. A good portion of the garage is reserved for massdot employees only. There is a valet service, not well marked, but they would not valet any car that was going to remain past 4 PM. We were there on a Wednesday afternoon entering the garage around 1:20p, planning to leave at 5pm. Very poor service! If they don't need customers, they'd better close down. No one is willing to help or even answer customers with the slightest politeness Had a parking issue (my own fault), and the two men working in the office were very helpful in resolving it.\n\nGarage is very clean and well lit. Tight but decent parking. EV friendly. Plaza inside clean, helpful, and safe. I parked my vehicle in this garage as I worked the BAA 10k race. Pulled into parking garage at 4:07 am and parked 5 spots away from Security guard. When I got back to my car my lock was popped and pulled out and money was stolen. I called their office that day and left an email as well and never heard back. I was hoping they had security camera's to see who may have done this. Terrible customer service to not even call me back. Be careful before you decide to park here. Was fine. I liked the wide array of products. Employee rolled her eyes at me when I told her I didn't have enough money, and I politely asked to have some items removed. She also short-changed me. The selection of hot food is not that great. There are no chocolate croissants either. This 7-eleven was always clean for the most part when I came in. Obviously there were tops etc. here and there from other customers, but besides that it was okay. The staff was also nice and efficient. The store offers a wide range of convenience items, from snacks and drinks to everyday essentials, available 24/7. It's great for quick stops, with fast service and a clean environment. However, pricing can be higher compared to regular grocery stores. The coffee maker is bad. An absolutely amazing venue, over 100 years old, almost Versailles like. If you haven't been yet, definitely put it on your list. The show we saw was the Simon & Garfunkle Story, Wow!, truly fabulous. When they did Bridge over Troubled Water, we thought the roof would come down. An absolute emotional performance. See it if you can. Nice little theatre, wish the rows were. Little bit further apart as I am 6\u20191\u201d and it was tight for me. Went and saw SIX and the show was amazing, the colonial is a little more intimate than the opera house which makes it a nice change for a broadway musical. Beautiful theater.  In Seattle service.\nAll seats seem to have a good view of the stage. I sat far left and was able to see the full stage. Gorgeous theatre in the heart of Boston! Recommend rushing tickets if available as it can get pricey. Seats are comfortable, concessions are wildly expensive, stage is huge; there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s a Broadway level stage! Few people in audience likened the ceiling to the Sistine Chapel. I had an amazing time watching Shrek the Musical. The inside of the theater is very beautiful. Going through the security was a breeze. It's a little bit tiny in the hallway, but it's manageable. I found it very cool that you can have snacks and drinks ordered directly to your seat. Bathrooms were clean and there's a bunch of stalls. Also, a huge thank you to Layne  because they made sure I was accommodated for my accessible seat. Very old theatre - seats are tight but the atmosphere is great. The people that work there are really pleasant and the show we saw was fantastic. I definitely recommend the Cirque Dreams Holidaze show for families and kids of all ages. My teenagers loved it. A lovely old venue that has been beautifully restored. Just be aware that there are a decent number of stairs involved for the main restrooms and mezzanine seats. (There are other seating and restroom options for persons with disabilities.) The theater itself is beautiful with a gorgeous chandelier hanging above the orchestra section.  Architecture is stellar and tasteful.\n\nWent for Cirque de Soleil Holidaze - it wasn't what I expected and a lot of the movements were not in sync with the music but overall it was a fun time and pleasant experience. Most (not all) of the employees were fairly friendly. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, a lot seemed disinterested and like they didn\u2019t want to be there but that didn\u2019t bother me and didn\u2019t really take away from the experience! Also as mentioned by others, the theater is old and run down but I felt it just adds to its charm. During the break I explored all the various sections and I appreciated the fact that you can just navigate the entire place in a few minutes and no one stopped me from doing that. I love the fact that you really have a good view of the stage no matter where you sit. The bathrooms could use updating and probably a good cleaning. The concessions weren\u2019t bad and the drinks were reasonably priced. There are multiple parking garage options within a 2-5 minute walk. The tickets are reasonable priced but the theater really only plays small local or low key (less well known) performances. I was extremely disappointed by the unprofessional conduct of the staff throughout my entire experience at this venue.\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that the staff were ill-equipped to handle basic tasks. They were unable to scan the digital tickets provided by Ticketmaster, causing unnecessary delays and confusion.\n\nThe lack of professionalism continued after the show began.  While a \"no re-entry\" policy was supposedly in place, it seemed to apply to everyone except the staff's friends, who were allowed to come and go as they pleased, presumably to smoke.  It also appeared that most of the door staff left after the show started, leaving no one to monitor the entrances.\n\nDuring the intermission, several staff members took seats at the front of the venue. While this wouldn't have been an issue in itself, one staff member sat next to us and proceeded to remove their shoes and eat a chocolate cake throughout the performance. This was incredibly distracting and disrespectful to both the performer and the paying audience.\n\nTo make matters worse, a staff member walked down the aisle multiple times during the show and loudly announced that no video or photos were allowed. This was completely unnecessary as no one was taking photos, and their loud pronouncements disrupted the performance.\n\nOverall, the staff's unprofessional behavior significantly detracted from my enjoyment of the show. I would strongly advise management to address these issues to ensure a better experience for future patrons. Smaller than I remembered but very intimate! I made direct eye \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f contact with a Blue \ud83d\udd35 Man \u2642\ufe0f and I was in the balcony in J section. I haven't seen the Blue Man Group in 23 years. I bought a discounted ticket \ud83c\udfab through Groupon. They will print out the ticket \ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f at the front window \ud83e\ude9f of the Playhouse.\nThey will use a metal detector at the door \ud83d\udeaa but security is very friendly. One told me where I can get a quick bite to eat before the show. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. My parking stub from 200 Stuart Street Parking Garage was validated and I saved a lot of $ on parking \ud83c\udd7f\ufe0f!\nThe Blue Man Group had more audience participation than the last time I went.  It was an enjoyable show. If you go, you may want to get a seat \ud83e\ude91 on the floor. If you have photo sensitivity to flashing lights, I wouldn't recommend this show since they use flashing lights. You are allowed to bring your cell \ud83d\udcf1 phone but you are not allowed to record \u23fa\ufe0f or have the flash \ud83d\udcf8 on. Try not to arrive late! The show actually starts five minutes after it's scheduled time.\nIf you are in the front row, you will need a plastic cover. \ud83d\ude49 Hearing protection is provided by the staff.\nYou may want to check out the Blue Man Group online first before visiting to see \ud83d\ude48 if the show is for you. The concert is different from the stage show at the Playhouse. My second time at this venue to see the Blue Man show, 100% worth the money. I highly recommend it. Not too big of a space, if you are seating on the lower level, no worries about seating to far if you can't afford close up tickets. Blue Man Group show\nTook my 10 year old grandson for his first live show.\nHe has not stop talking about it.\n\nFriendly staff.\nWe did not have the best seats, when the staff found out it was his birthday gift and his first time to a show, she moved us to better seats that were not being used. WOW! What an excellent and entertaining show! I've known about the Blue Man Group for years but didn't have an opportunity to see them until now.  The playhouse itself is unimpressive, but that is just the vessel that contains a good hour and a half of solid entertainment.  We were lucky enough, or unlucky by some opinions, to sit in the 3rd row.  The ponchos draped over the seats for us lucky ones gave us a hint of what was to come.  They didn't disappoint with their exploits on stage and the spritzing we received in the process. I won't spoil the grand finally by telling you what is in store,  but it was a blast!! GO and enjoy with your family and friends! And just a heads up,  this show tends to be loud,  so consider bringing some hearing protection for the young ones.\nIf you found this review helpful, please tap the thumbs up to let me know.  Thanks! Blue man group was great, taking a star off for Charles playhouse. It\u2019s small and not very comfortable and my handicapped Mother who has a hard time walking did not have access to an elevator. If I had known that, we wouldn\u2019t have gone. Food was excellent and it was a great experience. They provide some gloves and an apron for your meal and it creates a fun type of experience to eat with your hands like this. We ordered the tray \"deep ocean\" which came with two lobster tails, two clusters of crabs, a ton of shrimp, two corns, and some potatoes.\n\nAlthough expensive, it was well worth it. The Cajun seasoning was excellent and flavorful. However, I do agree with some of the other reviews here. The place does feel a bit... Lacking in cleanliness. Great service, food and location in Boston. If you craving seafood in bags, I recommend this.\n\nToilet could do with some polishing is my only minor criticism. Nice atmosphere, welcoming staff. Cajun seafood boil was \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffe. I would recommend that you visit if you're visiting Boston. Went to this establishment for the very first time yesterday and it was amazing. Drinks were good food was impeccable. The garlic Are an absolute must Shaking Crab MADE my visit to Boston so far.  Simply AMAZING in every way. I\u2019d read the reviews, and knew I had to come try the seafood. I wasn\u2019t sure when I walked in the door. Decor is understated and casual is the theme. The floor is slippery (for obvious reasons) Shiggy gave me two bibs and two sets of gloves\u2026that\u2019s when I knew I was in for something good.  I was amazed. Simply amazing experience tonight. Thanks Shiggy. You have great customer service. The seafood was so fresh and amazing\u2026from\nThe Alaskan king crab to\nThe shrimps. I highly highly highly recommend the Shaking Crab . I hope to be back soon.\n\nUPDATE. My second visit was more enjoyable than my first. Shiggy remembered me and what I asked for my first visit. Very enjoyable. Fantastic food once again. It would be a\nRegular if I was close enough to make it that.  Exceptional meal Crazy fast service! Delicious modern Mexican bowl with steak!\n\nCame back and tried the classic Mexican chicken burrito. I love that they offer broccoli and fajita veggies. And the Gussa sweet and spicy sauce has an impressive kick. Love it! Ordered pickup - staff was very friendly, quick to help and had my order ready sooner than expected. Food was delicious. Place was clean. Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better experience! SO happy I work right around the corner now! Great place for lunch! Portion size/price was right on the mark. Pictured below is the Original Bowl size. The picture is a little deceiving to look small, but there was a lot of ingredients packed in. I made my own bowl with white meat chicken and to my surprise, there was a lot of chicken in the bowl! Most places similar charge you $3+ for barely noticeable chicken. Definitely a filling meal for under $10 (if you don't add chips + salsa etc.) Very quick service and friendly staff, I ordered ahead online at 11:56 AM and it was ready in the pick up window by 12:02 PM. Will be going back more often! The best, BEST burrito in the city. I drive over an hour every once in a while to come get one. Worth the trip 200%. Super clean, organized, kind and efficient! So delicious and great portion!! I loved the decor of this restaurant. The service is fast and the amount of food for the price seems good to me. The food was good and tasted good. We ordered some juices that were delicious. The only thing I didn't like about the place was that the waiter gave us the bill before we finished eating, which seemed disrespectful to me because he didn't ask if we wanted anything else. As a tourist, I would go back to this place to eat. The server was really nice. Bbq pork spare ribs awesome. Orange chicken did not like that much. The fried coating was too thick. Mangolian beef was tasty. There was a pineapple litchi based drink which was really good. Did not like a Great Wall of chocolate(looks awesome in picture). Needed something more to balance the bitterness of dark chocolate The chicken lettuce wraps were delicious! Taylor made incredible drinks and was always checking up on what we needed! Thank you for the perfect dinner! I've had better food at Panda Express. And also a better experience.\n\nThis nice modest lunch outside should have been a nice quiet experience but the manager and their corporate policy to make it sound like a damn night club is just ridiculous. It's loud, and obnoxious music. Asked three times to just turn it down a little so we could talk and they refused.\n\nThe food? On par for be served buffet style. Over cooked. Dry. Flavorless.\n\nPf Chang's really has gone downhill. I had firecracker shrimp..super delicious!! I 100% recommend it. However, idk if it was specifically that night or just norms but our waiter and some other waiters were getting all orders wrong. Not jsut one time..multiple times. Had Great wall of cake I think, that was the name...it was average..not worth the money..felt more like browine than a actual cake..red velvet cake was out, otherwise would have order that. Place is big and seems quite nice... I loved the decor of this restaurant. The service is fast and the amount of food for the price seems good to me. The food was good and tasted good.

Place is big and seems quite nice... Service was great. Friendly fast and attentive! Sandwich flavor was not great. Similar to subway.\n\nProbably would only visit again in a pinch .\n\nClean restroom and dining space. Big fan of their new jalape\u00f1o ranch chicken wrap!! Might be replacing the bootlegger as my top choice. In addition to their sandwiches and wraps another highlight is their jalape\u00f1o chips, big fan and great crushed up in any sandwich for a bit of a kick.\n\nI typically get Jimmy John\u2019s delivered, but I went to the store to pick up for the first time in a while and service was just as fast. There was a unique smell when I walked in that bothered me a bit but otherwise place was clean and there was no line. May stick with their \u2018freaky fast\u2019 delivery, but either way I\u2019d highly recommend Went for lunch during NAR conference and I was so happy with it, I went back the next day. Fast service and the bread is delicious. Just not what it used to be. The bread keeps getting slimmer and less doughy. The delivery meat is not as fresh or tasty as it once was. It was a let down. I used to say jimmy John was better than jersey Mike's but jersey mikes deli meat is ten times better. First time order here because of a promotion. Much better than subway, staff was nice. will come back again when I\u2019m in the area\ud83d\ude0a I was a little surprised to hear that rock bottom is still open. They had their hay day, a decade or two ago on being a restaurant and micro brewery. Kind of like a Gordon Birsch kind of vibe. The beers are still pretty good and the food is pub. Overall, pretty good experience. Really really good place vibe is awesome the place is clean the service is great and the food is delicious had bbq and a few others and they wer just wat I wanted.\nDefinitely a place to go to if u are in Boston and want some good good wings. Great service by our waitress Went on a Monday night, Monday being s holiday, went right after the Blue Man group show at Charles Playhouse. There was a little crowd, but enough tables for everyone. The food was good. Got the deviled eggs, they were good, the egg was a bit over cooked but I still ate them all! Then we got a order of nacho\u2019s with beef topping, they were HUGE! They were very good only complaint is would add more hamburger topping, there was hardly any on it. Then ordered the Philly cheesesteak in a bowl without bread and a side of green beans. It was good! The place was clean with friendly service, bathrooms also clean. Overall good place, probably wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to go back there but still was worth trying! Really great spot! Nothing to blow you away, but the service was excellent (and food came out fast!), they played a lot of good bops (also at a volume you can still comfortably talk over), and this was one of the first bars in Boston I didn't dislike the coleslaw. The fries were excellent, I got the turkey club which is pretty standard but I wasn't disappointed, and the prices were reasonable, especially for downtown Boston. Is this a take your visiting parents for dinner place? No. But it's a decent first date location, or if you're like me, a good place to get food after seeing a performance at one of the theaters nearby. It is packed every weekend, food is good, service is little late, staff looks careless but it is really busy and we respect that, they\u2019re doing their best, it is entertaining, good music, good beer, fun atmosphere and I love this place The foods are standard. A little bit boring and no authentic flavor. The mushroom in our soups are raw. The vibe is nice. A lot of local people visits this place. I would recommend to come here for a drink rather than foods Cozy restaurant with delicious food right next to Tufts/Chinatown! I actually saw the ginger & scallion plate online, immediately wanted to try it and was not disappointed at all! I paired it with beef and sticky rice ($3.50 extra), and for appetizers I tried the Thai wings! The only criticism I have is that I wish the wings were cooked more with the sauce instead of a dip. Still very crispy and fresh! For my drink I tried the Peachy Paradise, and it was pretty sweet, light liquor, but not my favorite. Next time I will definitely try the Pom Cosmo (I\u2019m looking for the best Cosmos in Mass if anyone has suggestions \ud83d\udc40). I give this place a 10/10 either way because my waitress was nice , I enjoyed my time there and the food didn\u2019t take long to come out at all. They were able to seat us and serve us very quickly despite it being very busy. The food was delicious and service even better. Gf and vegetarian options too. Always the fun time going here. They have great food and nice drinks but the service can be slow at times. If you don\u2019t mind waiting a bit and are craving Thai. This is a great place to go to. Before I get to the food, i want to talk about the service. I went on a Sunday night, it was very busy, every table was filled with only 2 servers. Understaffed is an understatement. the food definitely helped their scoring, because I was growing impatient with the waitress, however, she was very nice and the meal I ate was her recommendation. Chicken Paanang Curry paired with a Thai iced tea. It was very delicious. Had the right amount of spice and a sweet milky base. The atmosphere could use either some music, or ambient noise. A lot of background chatter. Not my thing but could be yours. Late night in downtown Boston and we wanted a little something to eat. Boston Kitchen Pizza was a home run.\n\nWe ordered a few slices. They came out fast, hot and crispy!\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the name, because they have a full menu of options besides pizza.\n\nCustomer service was friendly, plenty of seating and clean. Great pizza  but today I got a tuna salad wrap. When I took the sandwich I was surprised that it was warm. I was hoping that they hadn't turned it into a melt, I don't like warm tuna. It was warm because they hated the wrap. Tuna was just the right moisture, not too dry not too wet. My only complaint, the onions were sliced a little too thick for my liking.\n\nDelicious \ud83d\ude0b I've been to this restaurant twice. Once for takeout and once for delivery. My take out experience was average. Customer service good, food hot and enough cheese. When I ordered delivery I ordered with Uber eats. I blame them for the majority of my experience. The delivery took forever and I had to reheat the pizza. The pizza looked overcooked and previously prepared not freshly made. The level of cheese was extra but delicious. Preferred pepperoni over cheese. Enjoyed their peanut butter cookies although they tasted a few days old and hard. Stopped by to try since my hostel was right around the corner. A lot of options for pizza, calzones, and other things. I got a cheese and pepperoni calzone to go and it was delicious! A little bit too big for one person but maybe two small to share. It was ready pretty quickly as well. I ordered a gyro, expecting the classic wrap with meat, tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, and onions in pita bread. Instead, what I received was more like a platter with slices of meat, salad, and rice in a takeout box. The taste was okay, but this is not what I\u2019d call a gyro. If you\u2019re looking for a traditional gyro experience, this might not be it. Overall, a bit disappointed as it didn\u2019t meet my expectations.\u201d This was my second time visiting Boston and eating at Genki Ya just like last time the food was delicious. The sushi was fresh and tasty. I had the spicy tuna and California roll loved both. I got there right before closing and they were very accommodating and sweet with no issues. The avocado crab and cucumber salad is to die for as well must have. Meow meow This place was great! We are a family of five vegetarians so we ordered the big veggie sushi platter and all of it was sooo delicious! We have never had sushi with bananas in it. The bananas were a creative addition that we all loved! I wish we lived nearby so we could go back. If so, this could easily become a weekly dinner spot for us. Food: The sushi here is pretty good, with a wide selection. There are sushi boats available, which are great for sharing with a large group.\n\nAmbiance: This place is two stories, so there is plenty of seating. I've primarily gone here for group dinners, which is great if you work in the area and want to go out with coworkers.\n\nService: I have not had any issues. The wait time is average. Not a bad spot, right across the street from the Moxy hotel. The staff was friendly, quick, and efficient. Sushi was pretty good as well. They have a small menu but good combos!\n\nNow for my standard comments. Location is clean and well kept. Sushi from here never disappoints, reasonable prices and the rolls are always great. Not exactly a fancy location, but a fun outing. Service is always great, we do birthdays here and staff is always super kind and accommodating for big groups This was the worst visit to Panera of my life! I ordered a Cobb salad, and when I opened it for lunch, I noticed that they forgot to put the dressing on the salad, so I had to eat it without any dressing. But that's not the worst part! When I was almost done with my salad, I discovered a dead fly in it! I don't think that's normal! So, I will never come to this Panera again. A very interesting place for a tourist to try a very different taste from the typical American burger!\n\nNothing better during the cold winter of Boston than a soup with a dipping sandwich to the side!\n\nDipping a sandwich in a special sauce is GENIUS and UNHEARD OF so it gets a plus in my book!\n\nIt's a must, especially because of how cheap it all was.\n\nWithout any drinks I spent less than 15$ for a full meal with those two delicious dishes, that's very rare to see in the US.\n\nDon't be afraid to have the spicy soup because it's not too spicy in my opinion so you can just\nFocus on the delicious taste! So worthy.\nGreat menu variety, warm, crispy, sweet or salty flavours.\nThe bakery offers options on bagels, cookies, muffins, croissants, tarts and pies. The restaurant has take away or eat-in.\nThe combos by less than $10 are the best combinations. - Fair prices for busy Boston centre\n- Good breakfast food with amazing amount of choice\n- Self serve coffee good\n- Service a bit abrupt only slight negative My colleagues and I ate at Panera Bread for several days during our conference trip. The service was always fast and delicious. It was also very clean. However, we did notice that the cinnamon crunch bagel was lacking the crunch but still very good. Super convenient location as it's open 24/7. I had the tuna salad sandwich. It was one of the best tuna sandwich I ever had. The French bread was soft. The tuna salad had a delicate balance of green onion and salt. I added cheddar cheese and avocado. The sandwich not big like a subway sandwich was 10.00 pricey but worth it. The sandwich without the add ons is 7.99.\n\nPs. Of course this location has alot of panhandling proceed with caution. So I don\u2019t usually have this problem at Au bon pain but tonight I  had an extremely horrible experience. Apparently during shift change, they close the store and no one wanted to come to the window to explain that to many us waiting outside. Finally the big guy came to the window yelling what didn\u2019t we understand that they were changing shifts. I told him I\u2019ve never experienced this and he just shut the window without given any info. And he said that he was busy doing other things and didn\u2019t have time to come to the window to explain. Very very RUDE. I was choked and I have a picture of him not caring for their customers. Nice bakery with great extended hours for patients family and health workers. Clean healthy food choices. I absolutely love Steven's attitude\u2014he's such a great manager! Every time I see him, he puts a smile on my face with his kindness and positivity.Thank you for making my caramel fraps taste amazing you\u2019re the best! The manager is a great guy. The rest of the staff are hardworking and kind. The food and coffee are always delicious. NYC Halal Guys was my first and brings back so many good memories. I stopped by on Thursday for a late lunch and my taste buds definitely missed the delightful mix of white sauce with a lil bit of red, on top of the yummy beef and perfect rice. The regular platter is perfect to share or to split for 2 meals. The food here was really good, it was delicious! Everything fresh and good.they give you pretty good amount of food and it will definitely satisfy you.\nHappy and Friendly staffs .\nHighly recommended !\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude4f Got a falafel sandwich and as one can see in the picture, you get a lot of food! It wasn\u2019t the best falafel I\u2019ve ever had but overall a great sandwich! Service was friendly and fast and it was pretty busy around dinner time! I had the original Hala guys food cart in New York City, and I wasn\u2019t a big fan of it. I guess the joke is on me. I tried their store location and it was even worse. The gyro meat is minced. I throw away half of the food. It was my friend\u2019s birthday and we visited to have some yummy food.\nUmaima is wonderful with the customers and even took an effort to bring my friend a surprise for her birthday. (A candle on a cookie and some cute balloons) would love to visit back again.!\nAmazing work. Love them\u2764\ufe0f One of the best, if not the best, Dunkin in Boston. The staff are so kind; they greet you and they\u2019re quick as well. Food and coffee is consistently good (never bitter or burnt tasting). Would definitely recommend to go here if you\u2019re in the area. I think the color of this iced coffee speaks for itself \ud83d\ude09 Often has a limited donut selection, but otherwise friendly service. Sometimes a little slow. Super convenient location tho and clean The staff here are extremely kind, my ratings here isn\u2019t for the coffee i had, but for their warm hospitality. They were always seen greeting everyone that entered the store. From the cashier to the one getting your order ready are so friendly.  Highly recommend you to visit this particular outlet, it\u2019s clean and well organized. We had breakfast at this Dunkin\u2019 store every morning for 3 days while we vacationed in Boston. The staff are very friendly and helpful (it was our first time at Dunkin\u2019!).\nI was impressed by how well they managed all the orders during the busy morning rush.\nGreat job guys! You have made some life long Dunkin\u2019 fans. Went 3 times during our stay in Boston and each time the experience was different. Generally the staff were quite abrupt, not very informative and doughnuts where missing display info.\n\nUpon saying that it was breakfast for under 10 dollars so take it with a pinch of salt It is a Taiwan restaurant with good name in Chinese \u5357\u5317\u548c which means unity of the south and the north literally.  Located in a great location by the corner of HI Boston Hostel.  I ordered Braised Beef Brisket Noodles Soup w.  Spinach, Fried Stinky Tofu with Pickles and Steamed Taiwan Style Meatball w.  Gravy.  The best is the meatball. Recommended. This was my second time here and it\u2019s the best Chinese food I\u2019ve ever had. All of the food was good and well seasoned. I\u2019ve never had crispy general Taos chicken it\u2019s usually soggy everywhere I go but these were so good. Soup dumplings are unreal and our waitress was a sweetheart. I wish I didn\u2019t live so far Do yourself a big favour! Don\u2019t enter this place if you like good food! I\u2019ve never had such terrible Chinese food my whole life! The seafood fried rice was tasteless, and  I found three little chewy shrimp and some cheap frozen calamari. The main course pork should have been called \u201cmain course, no meat, lots of fat only!\u201d Service was like the food, terrible and the prices outrageous for the garbage food! I came to this place because I was hungry, and all the other places were packed. But I truly don\u2019t understand why these terrible, so-called restaurants, with crappy food and service, always seem to survive! I wish I could give 0 stars because they don\u2019t deserve more than that! And really, I\u2019m not here to put restaurants to the ground, and if you read my other posts, it\u2019s almost all 5-star ratings and great reviews. This dirty and terrible place should be avoided at all costs unless you want to torture yourself! We ordered the weekday lunch specials. 3 dishes for $35.  Sole fish with vegetables, pork with bitter melons, and drunken chicken.  Very delicious!  Service is not that good but food is good.  Will go back to try pot stickers, soup dumplings, and other dishes. Exactly what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown: no frills, acceptable service, and good food.\n\nThe four of us split the pork soup dumplings, beef with peppers, pan fried noodles, and Shanghai bok choy. This amount was plenty of food and each dish hit the spot.\n\nService was efficient and our waters were always filled. Would definitely come back for some tasty food! Had a fantastic time at Happy Lamb! The weekend dinner price is $35 per person (including taxes), but it\u2019s more affordable on weekdays and even lower for lunch. Totally worth it for the experience!\n\nThe staff is incredible! super attentive, quick, and courteous. They\u2019re always on their toes, making sure everything runs smoothly.\n\nThe food options are endless! From fresh meats and seafood to a variety of veggies, noodles, and more, there\u2019s something for everyone. The broth selection is impressive, with plenty of choices for both meat lovers and vegetarians.\n\nIt\u2019s an all-you-can-eat experience for 90 minutes, so come hungry!! This was a great deal for fresh all you can eat hot pot! We tried it on a whim while trying to get out of the cold in Chinatown. The lunch special was under $25 and included a small variety of meats and broth(s) of your choice. Then all the vegetables, noodles, add ins, condiments, and even drinks are self-serve and included in the price. I greatly preferred doing it this way rather than needing to flag down a server for refills or to order more food. I also loved the setup of the \u201cbuffet\u201d for ingredients. It was more like shopping in a produce section of a store rather than digging stuff out of a row of pans. Everything stayed separate and tidy even though the restaurant was pretty full while we were there. They also had a variety of free vegetarian proteins so I think the price would be justified even if someone did not want to eat the included meats. We ordered three meats and the half and half (reg/spicy)broth. Split between the two of us it was more than enough, so we didn\u2019t need service at all once we started, but the waiter who set us up was very nice and our bill arrived promptly when we were finished. Highly recommend. Especially for the lunch time price. Happy Lamb Hot Pot is a great spot. They offer a ton of choices, and everything is fresh. The broths are packed with flavor and really stand out. It\u2019s a busy place\u2014there was a line around the corner even in the cold! The staff are friendly and quick, which makes the experience even better. It was fairly priced. Definitely worth the wait. Pretty typical pricing for a hot pot place. Unlimited serve your self. Very friendly staff, and overall a really fun experience. Lots of variety as well, and has really good beverages and desserts. This place was very cozy and had really delicious food. Would recommend but be aware that they usually have a bit of a wait during lunch and dinner times. The portions are very large so be aware. All in all the food is good and they have a good selection of meats, veggies and other food. We had a great experience here! We ordered Curried Chicken with Rice and Chow Kueh Teow (this dish we asked for vegetarian and they were kind and understanding about it!) and they brought them quickly. Great food and reasonable prices for the dishes we ordered. We were surprised to see it a bit empty but overall it had a great ambiance, food, and service. Vegetarians you can go!!! Great options\n\nAs an Indian and partially vegetarian (I eat only boneless chicken) this place had the option to customise your meals to your preference and that\u2019s what I loved about this place. The people treat you right, unlike the other Asian places where you don\u2019t get the opportunity to customise and sometimes looked down on for being a vegetarian. Trust me it\u2019s worth the price and food is extremely good.\n\nThe staff is very welcoming and hear your requests. So don\u2019t worry about options available. Authentic flavors. HUGE portions. Coconut rice was a solid 10/10 (tasted like chicken rice but with a light touch of coconut) and even small could feed two. Came back for dinner on the same day! Recommend both fish fillet and duck casseroles. One of my all-time go to favorite places in Boston to share a delicious meal and enjoy a nice walk after dinner (close to Public Gardens, Theater District, Downtown and Back Bay).\nThe menu has soo many great choices and offers classics like roti and beef rendang.\nEverything is made fresh and the flavors are absolutely devine.\nServers are friendly, attentive and helpful.\nIf you're in Boston and love good Malaysian food or want to try it for the first time, Penang is the place to go. Disappointment by the food here! It\u2019s underwhelming by how the taste missed the mark even when it came to simple dishes or what are known to be signature dishes to Malaysia.\n\nThe poh piah wasn\u2019t even close. Shredded lettuce in poh piah??? Absolutely ridiculous. The worst poh piah in my life even compared to those that I\u2019ve had in the United States. Please remove it from your menu if you can\u2019t even get the right ingredients to the appetizer. It gives the a ppetizer a bad rep and distorts the true reality of what poh piah is.\n\nChicken satay was ok. Lacking in taste since some of the common spices used wasn\u2019t added such as coriander.\n\nBeef rendang was at most more like curry beef. No rendang taste and the meat was dry. I can make better rendang at home.\n\nChow Kuay teow was the only dish that was close enough though missing what we call the wok hei (the smokiness of the stir fried noodles when cook on high heat). Only thing enjoyable that prevented the one star rating.\n\nWon\u2019t be coming back unfortunately. Food was excellent and it was a great experience. They provide some gloves and an apron for your meal and it creates a fun type of experience to eat with your hands like this. We ordered the tray \"deep ocean\" which came with two lobster tails, two clusters of crabs, a ton of shrimp, two corns, and some potatoes.\n\nAlthough expensive, it was well worth it. The Cajun seasoning was excellent and flavorful. However, I do agree with some of the other reviews here. The place does feel a bit... Lacking in cleanliness. Great service, food and location in Boston. If you craving seafood in bags, I recommend this.\n\nToilet could do with some polishing is my only minor criticism. Nice atmosphere, welcoming staff. Cajun seafood boil was \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffe. I would recommend that you visit if you're visiting Boston. Went to this establishment for the very first time yesterday and it was amazing. Drinks were good food was impeccable. The garlic Are an absolute must Shaking Crab MADE my visit to Boston so far.  Simply AMAZING in every way. I\u2019d read the reviews, and knew I had to come try the seafood. I wasn\u2019t sure when I walked in the door. Decor is understated and casual is the theme. The floor is slippery (for obvious reasons) Shiggy gave me two bibs and two sets of gloves\u2026that\u2019s when I knew I was in for something good.  I was amazed. Simply amazing experience tonight. Thanks Shiggy. You have great customer service. The seafood was so fresh and amazing\u2026from\nThe Alaskan king crab to\nThe shrimps. I highly highly highly recommend the Shaking Crab . I hope to be back soon.\n\nUPDATE. My second visit was more enjoyable than my first. Shiggy remembered me and what I asked for my first visit. Very enjoyable. Fantastic food once again. It would be a\nRegular if I was close enough to make it that.  Exceptional meal My first time trying Meditarean food @garbanzo was DELICIOUS! You must try their fresh baked pita bread. For dessert, you should try Baklava. Also, they have vegan options! I'll be back for the friendly service and they do cook their food with LOVE \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0b\n\nHere's what I ordered:\n1) Sirloin steak plate: Juicy meat, seasoned rice, cucumber salad, pickled onion, seasonal vegetables, red cabbage and lettuce.\n\n2) Steak kabob plate: Juicy steak \ud83d\ude0b\n\n3) @drinktractor cucumber soda: refreshing, naturally sweet, #Non-GMO and certified #organic.\n\n4)Sauces: must try cilantro and signature red sauce (spicy) ! My girlfriend and I were in town walking around and this place was right around the corner! We walked in and they served us right away. In addition to promptness the staff had superb customer service. When I was stuck between what kind of white sauce I wanted the staff let me try a sample and I was able to pick the one I liked which was really nice of them. But the best part about this place is that the food tastes amazing and is healthier than most \u201cfast food\u201d places.  I\u2019d recommend to anyone who wants to have a great meal.\n\nThey also have a bathrooms available for custom so big plus!! Big fan of garbanzo. They offer great deals for students and the food is super tasty. Very friendly staff and excellent service as well. Food is quite healthy. Enjoy getting plates, which are reasonably priced and offer good, filling portions. Nice proximity to the park, so if you wanted you could take your food and head over to a spot on the grass. I just ran the Boston marathon. Yay! And then I ate here. Booo. How this place gets a rating of 4.7 is beyond me. The gyro is absolutely mediocre. Paired with a coke (which was icy cold so kudos for that) it was $16. So purely on a scale of value, it\u2019s terrible. Go around the corner and get dumplings for your money and taste. On the bright side, the gentleman preparing the food was a gem. Super nice guy. Other than that and the cold coke do yourself a favor and pass on this place. Staff was awesome. Very polite. I came in with a picture and got a great meal. The food was delicious. Came here for breakfast, it was such a unique experience. The food was reasonably priced, and delicious. The service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere was chill, pleasant and festive; they play Mexican music. It has beautiful views of the Boston commons. I\u2019d come here again when in the area. Exceptional Mexican food next to Boston Common. I came in at 11 pm for a late night snack after a travel day and got a fried tilapia taco and some chicken tortilla soup. They were absolutely delicious and satisfying, Mexican comfort food at its best. I really liked their mix and match menu. So simple, but you have to know what you want. For good or ill, you may have plenty of time to make up your mind because this place can be popular, even (or especially) late at night. Stopped in on a Saturday night around 7pm and the place was busy! The line was 10+ people deep, but moving fast. The employees taking orders were quickly making everyone\u2019s food to order. The portions are quite big. The food is very tasty. The nachos had so many veggies on it. The burrito bowls were loaded with proteins and other toppings. If you go during a busy time, you may not be able to get table seating. I got the vegan chicken tacos, and my husband got the steak tacos with a side of chips and queso. Everything was so delicious and fresh! Def recommend this place! I am just reiterating what everyone else here is saying, but this  is genuinely a great place to get tacos. The atmosphere and ambiance is spot on, line moved quick, and the food tastes great! Portions are large and reasonably priced as well. They are made right in front of you, sort of like Chipotle style. The number of items they have is quite impressive, so I recommend studying the menu beforehand so as to not get overwhelmed. This was the first time I had visited a build-your-own-pizza joint. It was fantastic; lots of options and the pizza was quite large for what you pay. This is a fun place to go if you're out in the city with friends. However, the wait times tend to be long, so this is not the place to go if you're in a hurry. Blaze Pizza is a chain of pizza restaurants that had multiple locations across Massachusetts. The interior is quite large and clean, and overall the pizza is great.\n\nThe staff were pretty helpful and friendly, accommodating most requests for the pizza, which is helpful when you build your own.\n\nThe appeal of blaze pizza is their pre-made or build your own options, which we've never had an issue with. The pizza is a thinner crust, but that tastes good with the topping options. Pizza is also a bit on the expensive side, but overall the portions and toppings provided are pretty good quality for the price. We've tried multiple combos and pre-made pizzas, and they've never disappointed.\n\nOverall, a solid place to try in the area. Because this is the second time I\u2019ve had this type of experience with this location\u2026I\u2019m writing this review.\n\nPlease do NOT order online from here. I\u2019ve had no luck with accuracy of orders. The first time, the toppings were incorrect. As of writing this review, my ENTIRE order was incorrect. The drink was wrong (diet coke instead of coke zero) \u2014 this wasn\u2019t bad, and is understandable.\n\nBUT, my pizza actually didn\u2019t even have sauce. It was just cheese and pepperoni, and it was missing the condiment. Seriously though, how do you forget sauce on a pizza?It\u2019s even specified in the order. Granted, it\u2019s almost 2 hours until closing, and the work staff might be tired (as someone who used to work in the food industry, I get it), but this location has some serious quality control standards. I\u2019ve attached images, as well.\n\nNOT an experience you want to have when getting home from work late. This location is really clean and the workers are a vibe. Food always come fresh and tasty! I love being a regular here. Pizzas are baked well and toppings are super fresh. Love that the heat can be turned up or down based on the sauce you choose - I like mine painfully spicy! I always get the *Build Your Own* because it has the best price point. This was the worst visit to Panera of my life! I ordered a Cobb salad, and when I opened it for lunch, I noticed that they forgot to put the dressing on the salad, so I had to eat it without any dressing. But that's not the worst part! When I was almost done with my salad, I discovered a dead fly in it! I don't think that's normal! So, I will never come to this Panera again. A very interesting place for a tourist to try a very different taste from the typical American burger!\n\nNothing better during the cold winter of Boston than a soup with a dipping sandwich to the side!\n\nDipping a sandwich in a special sauce is GENIUS and UNHEARD OF so it gets a plus in my book!\n\nIt's a must, especially because of how cheap it all was.\n\nWithout any drinks I spent less than 15$ for a full meal with those two delicious dishes, that's very rare to see in the US.\n\nDon't be afraid to have the spicy soup because it's not too spicy in my opinion so you can just\nFocus on the delicious taste! So worthy.\nGreat menu variety, warm, crispy, sweet or salty flavours.\nThe bakery offers options on bagels, cookies, muffins, croissants, tarts and pies. The restaurant has take away or eat-in.\nThe combos by less than $10 are the best combinations. - Fair prices for busy Boston centre\n- Good breakfast food with amazing amount of choice\n- Self serve coffee good\n- Service a bit abrupt only slight negative My colleagues and I ate at Panera Bread for several days during our conference trip. The service was always fast and delicious. It was also very clean. However, we did notice that the cinnamon crunch bagel was lacking the crunch but still very good. Was surprised to see \"Chicago style\" pizza on the menu. As a Chicago native visiting Boston on a work trip, I had to try it. Had a good laugh once I got back to my hotel and opened it up. It's like they guessed what deep dish pizza is based on a 5 year old's crayon drawing. Paper thin. Doughy crust. But the sauce is on top, woah! Absolutely diabolical. I was thoroughly entertained as I ate the entire thing, it felt like I was the subject of a comedy central roast.\nIngredients tasted fresh, the sausage was particularly delicious. Online ordering and carryout was easy and friendly. Reasonably priced. Seems like a great spot to grab a slice if you're in the area. Easily a highlight of my visit to Boston. Keep it up, ya filthy animals. Supposedly, it's great pizza. It's just like any other. The worst part was the service... horrible. Waited 20 minutes to have 2 slices reheated?  So my pizza was sitting in their back kitchen in a box. Perhaps they didn't like my ethnicity? 20 mins, and they were given my a large order that was not mine. I would understand the wait if it were busy, but it was not. Never coming here again. Pizza should not tale 20 mins to reheat. Ordered online through their website to pick up on the way home from the office. Walked in right as it came out of the oven. $20 including tip for a small 2-topping pizza and an order of wings is not bad at all! Pizza was great - good ingredients, good crust, and they accommodated my special requests. I will definitely be back! Can't really give more starts because it was my first visit. I was walking around S. Boston and was wanting pizza. I found several places but this one fit the bill.. Service was good and the slice I had was ok. Maybe if I had tried the other places too I could give a different review. Overall, not bad. I would return.. BB is amazing!! A favorite in our household. We\u2019ve been coming here for a couple years now and the quality of food and service has always been great and consistent. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. It's mostly a takeaway joint on the Tremont Street across the Emerson college. You need to look for it, or else you may really miss the place.\n\nThey have a large menu at a reasonable pricebthat invludes burritos, sandwiches, pizza, drinks, bowls. I was fasting and hence needed a vegetarian option, which was on their offering.\n\nThey do have a small seating area( around 20 odd people). However, it's convenient to take away.\n\nWe ordered the bean bowl and the shrimp bowl. The quantity was filling, the shrimps were large in size, and the taste was edible. If you want a little more spice, then you can ask them for the spicy sauce ..its yum !!\n\nIt's well priced for the quantity and quality of food. Hole-in-the-wall taqueria with solid burritos and birria tacos.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to add about this place. Solid Mexican food at reasonable prices. With El Jefe just around the corner, I don\u2019t find myself going to Maria\u2019s as often as I did two years ago. Still, it\u2019s a great spot for a quick birria fix. I usually go for the birria burrito or tacos, and both have been consistently good. I thank God that I found this place. I\u2019ve been searching for a restaurant up here that reminds me of my home food back in the borderland, and this is it. This is the last Mexican restaurant I will ever need to try in Boston. Thank you for the delicious, authentic food, for the immaculate hole-in-the-wall vibes, for my full belly and the smile on my face!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4c try the Birria tacos and horchata, I highly recommend! Maria's Taqueria has very cost-effective and tasty tacos in a convenient location! Portion sizes are great as well. Would definitely consider getting tacos, taco salad and burritos from here and the best part is that it wont break the bank! The service is nice and quick. Atmosphere has room to grow.\n\nFood - 12/20\nService - 6/10\nAtmosphere - 3/10 The staff were kind, pleasant, and patient as we thought about our order. They were very accommodating, also. The interior is small and has five sets of tables, three of which were for four people. There was no air conditioning, so on hot days, it may feel stuffy. The food was tasty. I dont even know where to start. i made a date night reservation at 8:30, and when i got to the restaurant, i was told it is bar seating only.. after receiving multiple text confirmations, i was never advised of that.. why would someone make reservations to sit at a bar???? but that was just the beginning of an end. The food did not live up to the hype or his name AT ALL!  i didnt know what to order and i usually like to see pictures of the food.. big mistake. i was catfished. i go on their instagram to see the most scrumptious looking tenders, thinking they would be freshly hand battered, freshly warmed up at the least, Mh boyfriend ordered the cajun pasta, which he was told was the best thing on the menu after asking the waiter, but lord idk if he was fed feces of every cook in the back or what but, i was deceived . Im actually at a lost for words i cant even finish this review without getting pissed off about the $80 i spent. just look at the pictures and save yourself the agony. i had to eat sleep for dinner last night. The food was delicious, prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was relaxing. The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars was the service. The servers had zero personality and honestly might as well have been non-existent. We could have ordered from a kiosk and the dining experience would have been exactly the same. Flavortown really needs to hire people with some personality to bring home the experience. Big mouth mac n cheese burger was great according to my husband.\n\nI ordered the salmon burger without a bun since they don't have gluten free bread.\n\nI was told they do have gluten free pasta that they make fresh when ordered.\n\nThe fries were my favorite! Very good!\n\nServer was great. It's a cool hangout spot for an early family dinner or a night out. Upon entry, the hostess was pleasant checking us in and showing us to our table.  Our waitress was nice and made her rounds promptly. We started with the mac-n-cheese bites (which were new to the menu). I was pleased that they did not taste frozen and were a hefty size. We also had the bacon cheese fries or nacho fries (I forgot the name). Now be forewarned, there are a mix of fries, waffle, steak cut, and regular.\nFor the main course, there was the pulled pork on a pretzel bun. Bacon mac-n-cheese burger and the hot honey chicken. All were tasty, and portions were beyond what we were ready for. Needless to say, we took to go boxes. The cocktails weren't strong, but they were refreshing. The milkshakes were also a hit at the table! The food is so delicious. Price is average for the area. We were in Boston for a week and went almost daily so we could try everything. So good! Highly recommend!!! The dill pickle wings and nachos were unique and tasty. Burger was awesome.  And the Boston Cream pie was to die for.!!!! Best sweet chili wings wow they are amazing with blue cheese on the side . also, something amazing about this place you can order all flats with no extra charge I love that. I never had the other wing just sweet chili. I had the pizza slices are huge but not for me didn\u2019t like I would only recommend the best chili wing. The place is always clean and they always open check them out try the 20 piece sweet chili wings all flats side of blue cheese. The perfect pizza place. No frills, Open late, cheap and sold by the slice this giant pizza is perfect for ending the night. We went there twice in a row, and were able to split the slice and still feel like we had a good amount of pizza! Because I\u2019m vegetarian, we just got cheese, but there were lots of toppings if you wanted to go that route. My friend looked at a slice of pizza with more love than I have ever seen before. Needless to say to say, we were big fans New York Pizza is living on to it's name by serving one of the best \ud83c\udf55 in the city.\n\nI happened to be there on a gloomy weekend and boy oh boy I was awestruck after seeing these huge \ud83c\udf55.\n\nI tried the humongous veggie \ud83c\udf55 which was delicious and tangy to the extreme. One of my friends really loved the \ud83c\udf57 \ud83c\udf55.\n\nA must visit place for sure! This was my first ever taste of northeast pizza! As a resident of the south, my friends from the northeast would always rave about how different and special their pizza was. And let me tell you, they were right! Curious to see for myself, I found myself strolling through the streets of Boston at lunchtime and decided to try out this pizza parlor for a light lunch As it gave off an authentic vibe. It was the best decision I could have made! The flavor of this pizza will stay with my taste buds for all time, it was piping hot and freshly made, I went back a few hours later for seconds and it was still fresh and piping hot. even after indulging in more pizza in Brooklyn, New York, a few days later, I believe this place holds its own. If I find myself in Boston again, I will definitely be back for more. It\u2019s difficult to unbiasedly comment on staff being friendly or rude, as a southerner I was still culturally adapting to the straight-forwardness of the north eastern culture. All in alI felt my human interaction fine, not particularly nice, but also not rude either. We use to order here for years. But ever since last year the food quality is getting worse. Yesterday I ordered Alfredo chicken pasta. I told the The cashier to have my food well done and even if possible to crisp the top a little. I got my food and chicken is not cooked fully. It\u2019s hard to chew.\nThe burger was bad. We ended up throwing it.\nLastly my grilled Buffalo chicken salad was soggy and the chicken was not cooked. I even doubt if it\u2019s grilled. The Order was over 70$ and it\u2019s not worth the money. I\u2019ve been a customer for years and I\u2019m very disappointed know. BEAUTIFUL PLACE! Their matcha is top tier, no joke!!! & the bake goods are so so good. You do have to be on the lookout for a free table because it is a crowded place but overall the service is great & staffs are always friendly! I for sure recommend this place & will be coming back. Cute local bakery and coffee shop! Usually super busy here but the staff has it down to a science. They give you a number and they bring the food and coffee orders to you. I got a espresso and croissant. So fresh and great flavor. They have seating but it gets so packed you may want to get your food and coffee to go. We did get what we ordered pretty quickly though. Great location close to Boston commons. Cute place for brunch, pastries and coffee. The buttery croissant was wicked good. Better than my mocha treat I ordered haha Visited on a Monday morning around 9 AM with 4 guests. Somewhat busy but were able to find seats right away.\n\nLarge selection of pastries, breakfast items, and sandwiches.\n\nService was friendly enough and quick.\n\n-Breakfast Sandwich (okay)\n-Halloumi Breakfast Sandwich (okay)\n-Tomato Bisque Soup (okay)\n-Hot Chocolate (wasn't a fan)\n\nOverall, it was a decent spot for a quick morning bite, but I probably wouldn't return. In a town where Paul Revere once galloped past corner cafes, Tatte's Boylston Street location manages to feel both revolutionary and right at home. Housed in a commanding stone building near Emerson College, this outpost of Tzurit Or's growing empire demonstrates why the local chain has captured Boston's hearts, one laminated pastry at a time.\n\nThe space itself is a masterclass in adaptive reuse, where industrial ceiling beams meet marble countertops and checkered floors. A dramatic staircase leads to an airy dining room, where pendant lights cast a warm glow over bentwood chairs and communal tables. Floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with natural light, making it as suitable for morning meetings as midnight cramming sessions.\n\nThe kitchen doesn't just rest on its architectural laurels. A plate of scrambled eggs arrives cloud-like on hearty toast, accompanied by perfectly mass farmed wilted spinach and roasted tomatoes that pop with concentrated flavor. The pastry case, a daily museum of laminated dough and careful technique, presents everything from classic croissants to creative morning buns with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. Blood sugar levels will spike.\n\nService aims for a balance between Boston efficiency and European cafe leisure, though peak hours can test both staff and patience with notable queues. The price point (breakfast plates hovering around $15-20) might raise eyebrows, but the quality of ingredients and execution generally justifies the investment for those who are making it in America.\n\nOpen daily from 7 AM to 8 PM, Tatte Emerson has mastered the art of being all things to all people: a quick-grab coffee shop, a lingering lunch spot, and a serious dinner destination. The space is fully accessible, with thoughtful amenities like reliable Wi-Fi and outdoor seating when Boston weather permits (roughly three weeks per year, if we're lucky).\n\nLike the best historical buildings, Tatte Emerson has become something of an institution itself \u2013 one where privileged students debate philosophy over shakshuka, and business deals are closed over halva bomboloni. In a city that knows its coffee and counts its pennies, that's no small feat.\n\nJust remember to bring a sweater \u2013 the aggressive air conditioning suggests someone in management might have a side hustle selling hot coffee. Though as one regular noted, there's always a warm spot behind the toaster if you know where to look. Simple thing.   Grabbing a Boba tea.  Some people call it bubble tea.   Whatever you label it,  it's a fun drink with a lot of choices.   They do a great job here.  You order at a kiosk. It's nice not having to sound out all the little things you want that will make your drink special for you. So good! I had the flaming brown sugar milk tea and it was delish. I could only get it in one size though and it was way too much for me. Tried the taro boba tea with 30% sugar and I really liked it! Would recommend as it\u2019s also pretty affordable. High quality tea! And yummy food options, I like the eel bowl.\nI made a specific note to myself that their green tea / matcha tastes more delicious than others. Fairly convenient location also, with stations to order and customize the tea options yourself. Great place to get some rice bowls and chicken.\nVivi\u2019s has been one of my go-to spot for a quick lunch. Although, their specialty seems to be bubble tea, they do an amazing job with the popcorn chicken and the rice bowls. All the rice bowls have the same classic Japanese bowl toppings - seaweed salad, pickled ginger and pickled radish. Among the 4 bowl options, beef and onion bowl was my favorite, and the combination of pickled ginger and greasy beef and onions was especially satisfying. Their popcorn chicken was also very tender, and I would recommend getting either the basil or the curry flavor. BEAUTIFUL PLACE! Their matcha is top tier, no joke!!! & the bake goods are so so good. You do have to be on the lookout for a free table because it is a crowded place but overall the service is great & staffs are always friendly! I for sure recommend this place & will be coming back.

Somewhat busy but were able to find seats right away.\n\nLarge selection of pastries, breakfast items, and sandwiches.\n\nService was friendly enough and quick.\n\n-Breakfast Sandwich (okay)\n-Halloumi Breakfast Sandwich (okay)\n-Tomato Bisque Soup (okay)\n-Hot Chocolate (wasn't a fan)\n\nOverall, it was a decent spot for a quick morning bite, but I probably wouldn't return. In a town where Paul Revere once galloped past corner cafes, Tatte's Boylston Street location manages to feel both revolutionary and right at home. Housed in a commanding stone building near Emerson College, this outpost of Tzurit Or's growing empire demonstrates why the local chain has captured Boston's hearts, one laminated pastry at a time.\n\nThe space itself is a masterclass in adaptive reuse, where industrial ceiling beams meet marble countertops and checkered floors. A dramatic staircase leads to an airy dining room, where pendant lights cast a warm glow over bentwood chairs and communal tables. Floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with natural light, making it as suitable for morning meetings as midnight cramming sessions.\n\nThe kitchen doesn't just rest on its architectural laurels. A plate of scrambled eggs arrives cloud-like on hearty toast, accompanied by perfectly mass farmed wilted spinach and roasted tomatoes that pop with concentrated flavor. The pastry case, a daily museum of laminated dough and careful technique, presents everything from classic croissants to creative morning buns with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker. Blood sugar levels will spike.\n\nService aims for a balance between Boston efficiency and European cafe leisure, though peak hours can test both staff and patience with notable queues. The price point (breakfast plates hovering around $15-20) might raise eyebrows, but the quality of ingredients and execution generally justifies the investment for those who are making it in America.\n\nOpen daily from 7 AM to 8 PM, Tatte Emerson has mastered the art of being all things to all people: a quick-grab coffee shop, a lingering lunch spot, and a serious dinner destination. The space is fully accessible, with thoughtful amenities like reliable Wi-Fi and outdoor seating when Boston weather permits (roughly three weeks per year, if we're lucky).\n\nLike the best historical buildings, Tatte Emerson has become something of an institution itself \u2013 one where privileged students debate philosophy over shakshuka, and business deals are closed over halva bomboloni. In a city that knows its coffee and counts its pennies, that's no small feat.\n\nJust remember to bring a sweater \u2013 the aggressive air conditioning suggests someone in management might have a side hustle selling hot coffee. Though as one regular noted, there's always a warm spot behind the toaster if you know where to look. Simple thing.   Grabbing a Boba tea.  Some people call it bubble tea.   Whatever you label it,  it's a fun drink with a lot of choices.   They do a great job here.  You order at a kiosk. It's nice not having to sound out all the little things you want that will make your drink special for you. So good! I had the flaming brown sugar milk tea and it was delish. I could only get it in one size though and it was way too much for me. Tried the taro boba tea with 30% sugar and I really liked it! Would recommend as it\u2019s also pretty affordable. High quality tea! And yummy food options, I like the eel bowl.\nI made a specific note to myself that their green tea / matcha tastes more delicious than others. Fairly convenient location also, with stations to order and customize the tea options yourself. Great place to get some rice bowls and chicken.\nVivi\u2019s has been one of my go-to spot for a quick lunch. Although, their specialty seems to be bubble tea, they do an amazing job with the popcorn chicken and the rice bowls. All the rice bowls have the same classic Japanese bowl toppings - seaweed salad, pickled ginger and pickled radish. Among the 4 bowl options, beef and onion bowl was my favorite, and the combination of pickled ginger and greasy beef and onions was especially satisfying. Their popcorn chicken was also very tender, and I would recommend getting either the basil or the curry flavor."

    "reviews": "This garbage bank has once again locked my account due to \u201csuspicious activity\u201d despite my having gone through their entire verification process. Now I have to go over it again and I am trying to use my American Airlines card abroad. If you like having to be on the phone constantly then open an account here, but if you value your time and sanity please do not. These are the most incompetent and least customer friendly people I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with and once I can verify my account for the SECOND TIME in less than a week I will be cancelling both of my accounts with them because I cannot verify my identity and wait for a letter every time I make a purchase. Their fraud prevention team is the most incompetent and useless department I have ever meet from the main employees to the supervisors. I can honestly say if you can open an account at ANY other bank do it. These people don\u2019t care about my well being despite explaining I am a student in another country attending school. I sincerely doubt they will care about yours. No it isn\u2019t entitlement because I followed each and every step they provided so that I would not have an issue and they still blocked access to my accounts, so either they are incompetent or their process is flawed. Furthermore, the employees love to apologize for the inconvenience but do not actually do anything to remedy the issue. Perfect home for homeless, if you need to withdraw cash find another atm. HOMELESS LIVING EVERY DAY/EVERY NIGHT. DONT BANK HERE. DONT BANK WITH CITI It is NOT a bak that is open on Sundays. It's only an ATM location. wrong information, it's not a 24h agency What excellent customer service moments before closing over the phone to help my Dad send flowers to his Bride of almost 56yrs while in the hospital. The description given and product delivered put my Ma in tears as she said it looked just like her wedding bouquet. It made the whole medical floor jealous of their decades of romance to see such beauty of love delivered in time of need. Thank you thank you thank you sooo much for such swift service and exceptional product. I received a dozen roses on valentine's from my bf. The roses were wide open when he picked them up, 2 days latter all the petals are falling off. Definitely not fresh flowers. Will never purchase from there again. Ordering delivery for Valentine's Day could not have been easier! Can't recommend Olympia Flower enough!\n\nMost people would joke that if you have flowers delivered to significant other on Valentine's, you need to do it at work to make a scene. Right? I was able to quickly and easily schedule delivery for the Back Bay area to my partner's office with simple instructions in the notes of where to drop off.\nOlympia's delivery arrived perfectly timed during a large meeting with another manager bringing them in from the front desk. To me this was absolutely perfect timing on the delivery person's part since I wanted to be able to make a (thoughtful) scene from over on the West Coast today.\n\nBig Thank You to Olympia for an incredibly easy transaction through and through. And she loved the flowers, the surprise delivery, and had only great things to say about the arrangement itself. 10/10 would order again Ordering by phone, staff was so helpful     Filled our order to perfection with the requested flowers and colors and made the specific delivery window.  Will be using Olympia  Flower Store again. Larry and his team continue a decades long tradition of providing amazing arrangements for any occasion.  Pop into the store, see the history of the neighborhood and the store on its walls, chat them up, and place your order.  You won\u2019t be disappointed!  They\u2019re worth every penny! After my account got hacked, I went to this branch as its closest to my work. Betty was an absolute angel. She was able to get my money returned to my account (1100 dollars) and have a brand new account opened for me all during my lunch break. I was obviously upset at having my money taken but she helped me to stay calm and made sure everything got fixed. The best customer service I\u2019ve ever had at any bank. 10 stars for Betty and her staff!!! Have been waiting for a customer rep.  They\u2019re all in a group gossiping about clients and not doing any work\u2026. Closing our accounts today.\n\nAlso, they open accounts without your permission. Few months ago, my dad went there to open a checking account. I registered him online and saw he had two accounts open. He absolutely didn\u2019t know about the other. This also happened to another client when we were closing our accounts.\n\nThey also questioned the elderly lady why she\u2019s closing her account. Her answer was \u201cI didn\u2019t open it\u201d. The rep was giving her hard time. I had to tell them that\u2019s what the elderly lady wanted and do what she says or I\u2019ll report it to the CFPB.\n\nSeems like they\u2019re preying on elderly people who don\u2019t speak English to make their quote on account opening. The worst service I received since I have been in Boston. Extremely arrogant toward client and occupied client\u2019s time even it is not needed. Michelle explained how your day can be ruined in no time. On January 14, 2021 I went to Santander Bank to withdraw money from my account. The Bank is located at 61 Harrison Avenue Boston MA at 11:38 am. I work at the hospital and this branch is very close to me. Xie Zheng Lei was the branch teller who gave me the money. When I told her the amount, she asked for my ID (Which I understood because of the amount) she took it and passed it to the teller next to her and started talking in their native language. I found that extremely rude because I could not understand and I thought they were talking about me. Xie counted the money by hand and also used the money counting machine. I asked for a receipt, an envelope and left the bank. Immediately, I went to Citizens bank at 580 Washington st. Boston to deposit the money into my other account at 11:45 am. The branch teller used the money counting machine and told me that a $100 bill was counterfeit bill. I was shocked and very very angry. I asked to talk to the manager at this branch immediately. I spoke with Herb Wong and he explained that they could not give me the counterfeit bill because they needed to make a report. I did not want to waste any time and return to Santander bank. Herb Wong told me to take the report, the copies of the counterfeit bill and go back to Santander to speak with branch manager Betty Chan.\nI went back to Santander bank and ask to talk to Betty Chan. The branch manager was on vacation. I asked to speak to an assistant manager or a supervisor and for my surprise they did not have anyone there. I was furious. Nobody wanted to talk to me or help me to resolve this problem. Eric Hall one of the personal banker was the only one who tried to help me by calling and sending emails to other banks. Eric was the only one who went above and beyond to calm me and make me feel comfortable.\nEric Hall sent me an email saying, \u201cWe checked into the counterfeit currency report from Citizen\u2019s bank that you presented. Due to the fact that the money had already left the branch and traveled to another bank, neither bank can offer a refund for the $100 due to the concept of time outside the bank.\u201d I went the next day to Eric and asked to withdraw the rest of my money and to close the account. Then, I asked Eric if the money counting machines that they have there are supposed to find counterfeit bills and he said that Santander bank at this specific location does not have them. I was very angry at the fact that I could no longer trust my bank. I do not know if the Xie (bank teller) robbed me and put the counterfeit bill there.\nEvery day I work very hard and now, I am out $100 and Santander bank have it. Due to this experience I can say that Santander Bank is the worse bank I have ever used. I will tell my experience to everyone I know. The chinatown branch staff had trouble under my concern. Insufficient number of staff. I\u2019ve been here once and Jia Ho Supermarket offers a great variety of authentic Chinese products and fresh seafood, an ideal place to buy some real Chinese ingredients if you want to make some Chinese cuisines. I loved coming here. They have good prices and good selections of everything. My mother even saw a snack that she hasn't had in 30 years! I got firm and soft tofu, waxberry juice and soda, Lao Gan Ma spicy chili crisp, and much more.\n\nWhat's great is that this store is open later than most other Chinese grocery stores around. Most grocery stores in Chinatown close at 7pm but this is the only one that is open until 8pm. I love this place and I\u2019m so happy it\u2019s still in business. I used to come here to get all my groceries in college and it\u2019s such an unassuming location but it\u2019s huge. great selection and good produce. I was Soo Exciting to Seeing everything,  All The Snacks, Food  Etc This is a great supermarket with a surprisingly good produce section. They have live fish and shellfish in a wide selection. The store is narrow at the front, but widens into a large space in the back. You can find most Chinese products that you could hope for. Since the cmart in the building with Hei La Moon is being demolished, I will definitely be coming here to Jia Ho more often. It's difficult to park in this area, but there is a garage that charges 18 dollars close by, and combining the trip to the market with a meal at Empire Garden upstairs or the Q down the street is a great idea. Otherwise it is walkable from the T station. Ordered wine on the website but when I arrived at the store to pick it up, they did not have the vintage that I ordered. Their online inventory needs to be more accurate. I come here for all of my alcohol-related purchases, especially wines. They have a wide variety of wine selections and extensive alcohol and snacks too. Staff is incredibly helpful, friendly and knowledgable about their stock and selections. Usually come here to get wine gifts for parties or a special occasion. Prices are reasonable. Don't order online. I ordered a rare item at 1 pm.  Called @ 4 to verify they had it.  Drove all the up here and they don't have it.  Waste of time and resources. They are so pricey....so expensive.....they charge more 4% if you use your debit card....Don't go to this place....by the way the selection of drinks is very poor....they are so pricey.....so pricey....they charge until for your breathing.\nI used to pay $ 6.99 for a London Gin (every where)....\nThey charge $ 9.00 + tax + 4% for use your debit/credit Card. Went to this location because their website showed terrific prices. As the cashier rung up the total, I was shocked. I asked for the amount of each bottle. They were anywhere from 35-70 more than what the website (no stickers on the bottles.) when I confronted both her and another gentleman in the store about it, and ask them to honor the website price, I was met with hostility, and told that they don\u2019t manage the website. If you were looking for spirits and use their website for reference, don\u2019t go here. Not the same place, but I was like: \ud83d\ude2f\n...an epiphany moment. Under new management: I'm angry at them as they Cheated me out of $20.00 when I was in a rush. I've gone there for years and had a good relationship with them (Monica, Anthony). ... Nice place to go... very convenient & cheaper than the wild duck... except costumer service could improve... Cashiers can be rude sometimes. Not very friendly store and staff are awful I keep trying to like this place but something is always amiss. Ordered take out and all of the sashimi in it was frozen. Not my idea of fresh fish in a sushi restaurant. What WAS thawed out was fine tasting, but not worth the money I spent at all Really solid spot for the price. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed the sushi rolls, and they were quite affordable. It is also a tight, small seating area but its cute and fun. The service was also decent as well. I would recommend going with the rolls that aren't \"special\" because even though the special ones are good, and maybe worth a try, the regular sushi rolls are good and give you more value for money. While exploring Chinatown in Boston, we wanted to find an authentic sushi place and even though sushi is Japanese, and we were in Chinatown, we found a great little place! Avana sushi was tucked into unassuming little food court, where three or four other businesses are packed in a small space. There is limited seating, but there is inside seating. There was a bit of a language barrier as the owners wasn\u2019t great, but we got through it! Everything they made was from scratch, and it was amazing! We got there right as they opened and we were the first customers but as we sat there eating our food, the phone didn\u2019t stop ringing and local customers poured in and out nonstop ordering lunch to go which for us as a telltale sign that this is a place that the locals love and that tells you everything you need to know! I would definitely recommend this if you\u2019re looking for sushi in Boston! We will be back! Great sushi at affordable prices. Nice staff and I recommend the Lunch special! Went to pick up avana sushi and then ate it at home. It is a bit tricky to find, but its actually a mini-mall/food court area inside a slightly larger complex. The sushi is cheap and tasty. You get filled up pretty well. You can get 32 basic rolls for 30 dollars. Id say thats a good deal. Highly recommend the spicy tuna and salmon rolls. Specialty rolls are great as well. Amazing lunch experience at Stillwater. Our waiter Eddie was a sunshine, full of energy! I ordered the smoked pork belly mac & cheese and I can\u2019t stop thinking about this dish\ud83e\udd24 Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9 as a desert was amazing as well! In total we paid 60$ for 2 dishes, 2 dessert & 1 soda so it is very decent!!\n\nWould recommend to anyone visiting Boston !! Excellent food at the main area in Boston. Had their deviled eggs and ritz chicken. It was satisfying. On a rainy day and late in the evening near South station, we had filling and tasty dishes. A little expensive because of the main spot. The ambience was also great. The desserts here are particularly noteworthy. I would recommend the creme brulee more than the donuts which are a little one note.\nThe mac and cheese is ok but fairly ordinary. The service is excellent. Delicious delicious brunch! We got a small meal - chefs special pancakes and biscuits. The pop tarts were amazing as well! The Ritz Chicken is amazing!! We\u2019ve stopped by many times, and I\u2019ve never gotten a picture because as soon as it\u2019s set it front of me I start eating. Too good to wait, and consistently top notch. Other notable items are the marry me chicken, pork Mac and cheese, and $2 oysters. Highly recommend for a casual, delicious meal. Conveniently located in Chinatown, this place was very busy on a Saturday, likely due to its affordable prices and central location. The restaurant has a somewhat gritty feel and is more of a quick in-and-out spot rather than a place to linger. Don\u2019t expect great service or atmosphere, but it offers decent, fast food for the price. I\u2019ve had both better and worse. I\u2019m a foodie from Japan, and I don\u2019t know why this place has only four stars. We tried it once, but it was beyond our expectations. The food was so authentic and offered plenty of options. The fried noodles were excellent and came in a huge portion. The staff was attentive. There are plenty of pho restaurants in Boston, but this one offers a more authentic experience with a variety of great dishes! We\u2019re so happy we found such a great place! Was in the area and stopped for quick dinner. Not a small place , but cramped  up with too many tables, extremely noisy.\nPho x-large $16 came out in 3 minutes, some might like it speedy, but soup was not hot at all to cook the undercooked noodles, broth had no rich bone marrow flavor, yet very salty with soy sauce flavor instead. There was  barely any noodle in soup but  It did come with lots of beef though.\nVermicelli with grilled shrimp and vietnamese ham $16.45-  it came without grilled shrimp...had to call server to correct this. Vermicelli was undercooked ,or was frozen and with no soup to cook for this dish, it was worse than pho.\nVermicelli with grilled beef $16.45 - beef almost burnt and too chewy. Vermicelli again undercooked.. Great food!!! The wonton soup had amazing flavor! Best wonton soup I have ever had. Eggs rolls were very good, not greasy. Fresh spring rolls were good with yummy dipping sauce. Beef pho with rare steak and tripe was delicious. Came out warm not hot, the only reason I took one star off. Great service. Restaurant prefers cash. The pho at this place is super good! Though to be fair I\u2019ve never had bad pho. If you\u2019re looking for an incredible dining experience then this probably isn\u2019t what you\u2019re looking for but it\u2019s a simple place with great food and cheap prices (perfect for college students and I did see quite a few). My favorite part of everything was how flavorful and well cooked the meat was in both of my dishes, along with the dipping sauce that came with the non-pho dish (I forget what it was called). Wanted to try Dunkin in its Boston home.\nHad coffee & a donut.  Just ok, in terms of taste, coffee quality, service and ambiance Beautiful clean store. Very new looking and nice. Absolute slowest service in the world. Took 10 minutes to get a small iced coffee with very few other people in the store. The workers just kept talking to each other instead of making the drinks. I'm all about accountability. If u make a mistake just apologize n fix it. We're human. Made a mobile order and arrived to pick up. Order was shown on screen as available but workers was adamant that there was no order. When corrected, one worker gave wrong order. Placing bag of items aggressively on the counter. Where do you find these people to hire? Do better Coffee here is usually burnt/more bitter than usual, but they\u2019re better at mobile orders than some of the others in the area The line appeared long, but the workers moved it quickly. The shop was clean with no trash or stains. The donuts tasted great and were fresh. I'm quite surprised by how good their limited time peeps donut was The best hot pot in Boston! I\u2019ve been a loyal customer for years. The soups are packed with flavor, even the plain house broth is surprisingly enjoyable. The boneless short ribs are always top-notch\u2014whoever their vendor is, they deliver consistent quality every time. A must-try spot! Plus, the Allston location is just as fantastic. This place is located in Chinatown. It was absolutely delicious. I ordered beef, while my husband ordered for seafood for his shabu shabu. Personally, I prefer beef. After finishing my beef, I boiled the noodles, and they were incredibly delicious. I highly recommend this place. Broth and food are extremely fresh and high quality! Kind and friendly staff. Can\u2019t wait to come back! Only thing I\u2019d say is I wish there was a sauce bar. You\u2019re provided soy sauce with a side of garlic and scallions. It is a very good base but I like how other places let you customize your sauce. Thanks for the great food!\n\nEdit: I want to correct my mistake. I said that you aren\u2019t able to customize your sauce. All I had to do was ask\u2026 duh! I asked for more garlic and cilantro and within 15 seconds I had it. What a great place! This is a great place to go with friends, share a meal and have a great conversation. The beef tongue and octopus appetizers are delicious.  Cooking your meal in the hotpot helps encourage conversations.  I highly recommend this restaurant. Shabu Zen: Quick and Tasty Hotpot\n\nShabu Zen is my choice for a quick hotpot fix. The standout feature here is the fast service, which ensures you won't be waiting long for your bubbling pot of goodness.\n\nThe menu offers a wide selection of meats, veggies, and other hotpot delights, providing a variety of choices to customize your meal. What sets Shabu Zen apart is the extensive range of broth options, allowing you to tailor your hotpot experience to your taste.\n\nHowever, as a self-proclaimed sauce enthusiast, I was slightly disappointed that they only offer one sauce. Hotpot, for me, is all about the dipping and experimenting with different flavors, so the limited sauce selection left me wanting more.\n\nWhile I do stop by Shabu Zen from time to time, there's still a special place in my heart for other hotpot spots in Chinatown. Despite the quick service and variety, the overall experience can sometimes feel a bit rushed. \ud83c\udf72\ud83e\udd62\ud83c\udfee Asian spot in downtown Boston that's known for its fried chicken. It was near my hotel and my daughter eats here often so I had to try it. The fried chicken is as good as advertised and the Asian cuisine is also very good. This was my first time having Buffalo drumsticks but I don't want it to be my last. Pros: Flavorful food. This is comparable to the Korean chicken I had in Korea, which I missed so much since leaving. The wings were crispy and just the right sweetness. The deotbokki was sweet and cooked in the perfect texture. I have too often had the rice cakes overcooked or undercooked at a Korean restaurant, but this place has it spot on. This is a great choice for those who haven't had Korean and would like to try. I guarantee you'll find something you like here.\n\nCons: This is not really a con, but if do not know this, you will regret not knowing before going: Order the wings first as you browse through the menu. It takes them a while to prepare them as they batter and fry them fresh in the kitchen. As soon as they come out, they are hot and delicious while you wait for your other food. Be careful not to burn yourself! Went here for dinner yesterday night and the food was so good. Last call for food is 30mins before closing so we arrived just in time. We waited about 15-20mins for our food. We ordered appetizers but everything came out at once. There aren't any complaints about the food. Everything was good. We ordered the Medium size(18) wings half furious /half bbq (I requested all flats), the Spicy Pork with rice, the Gyoza(Pan Fried), and the fried shrimp (which came out in balls). It was all so good and the wings are so crispy and also juicy, it was perfect. I also ordered an Alcoholic drink, Juicy Pear Martini. It was fruity and so good. I definitely recommend this restaurant. The total for our food and the drink came to be about $84. We went to Crave on Sunday around 5 pm. It was not busy as we were early before the standard dinner time. We ordered 3 dishes; Korean fried chicken, spicy pork bulgogi, and topkoki. On drinks, we ordered hot sake. It was enough for two people. The food was good, and the portions were generous. We didn't even touch the spicy pork bulgogi as we were full, so we had to bring it home! I would definitely revisit this place and explore more of its menu! Overall, we had a pleasant experience and would highly recommend it! I would say this is easily the best lounge / bar in the area. With lots of great food and atmosphere. Perfect for dates, group, or drinks with your co-workers. Their chicken wings are amazing and unique but I feel like I am not doing the restaurant justice if I only write about that which they are known for.\n\nWhenever I come here, I always HAVE to get the tuna dumplings (they also have salmon version too!) and they have a number of dishes that I like that I rotate depending on my mood. Their truffle fries are good (i like the side of sauce they provide).\n\nI usually also order their kimchi fried rice. They also have a variety of salads that I like, one in which includes \"The Amazing Salmon Salad\" and \"Spicy Crab Avocado Salad\" are among my favorites. Worst Chinese restaurant in Boston\u2019s Chinatown.\n\nAs the only Chinese food option available past 2 AM in Boston, New Moon Villa might seem like an enticing choice after a night out. However, I've fallen into this trap multiple times and always regretted it after just a couple of bites. Located slightly outside of Chinatown in an area with little foot traffic, it\u2019s no surprise that I rarely see people dining in. The quality of their food is the lowest I've encountered among Chinatown restaurants, and it was clear why it\u2019s not a popular spot for dine-in.\n\nEvery single item I\u2019ve gotten from my past few takeouts, except for the white rice, has been underwhelming. The salt and pepper entr\u00e9es, like the wings and spareribs, had decent seasoning, but the brittle and sharp bone pieces suggested they were old, frozen meats. The Szechuan Twice-Cooked Pork was drowning in sauce, with pork portions so small it felt more like a hide-and-seek game than a meal. For the price, I expected a lot more pork and a lot less sauce and vegetables.\n\nThe Chinese Sausage Fried Rice was downright nasty and inedible due to its pungent smell. When I opened the box, it hit me with an odor reminiscent of dishwasher steam. While it tasted slightly better than it smelled, I couldn\u2019t get past the stench and ended up tossing most of it. If you're craving some rice, I\u2019d recommend sticking with the plain white rice.\n\nProbably won't be ordering from here again. If you're really craving some late-night Chinese takeout, I'd suggest hitting up places like Jumbo Seafood before 2 AM. After stumbling out of a concert some locals brought a friend and I to this spot for some late night food and tea. By far one of the greatest experiences of my life. The food was delicious and came out piping hot (yes even at 3AM), the staff was amazing and the other guests were even better. Not to mention, sushi so fresh you can even pick the fish you\u2019d like straight from the tank! Overall a very wonderful night, this will be my new spot every time I visit Boston from now on  JUST LEFT !!!\nFood was cooked fresh to order, spare ribs, Fried dumpling, scallion pancakes, \"shredded chicken\" which was sliced, and beef Lomain, 2 waters (we expected glasses of water [free]@ most places, we received bottled,  which we didnt ask for)(( $4.00)) our bill came to 61.50 plus 17.00. For what??? They add money where they can, adding waters we didn't order, plus tipping themselves. . . Like what?? No, you rushed us out. For was good, like perfect drunk food. But WATCH YOUR CHECK!! THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR ANYTHING THEY CAN AND ANYTHING THEY WANT. We relied when the table behind us complained saying, don't charge us for waters we didn't order, and we didn't ask for chopsticks! They charge you?!?! This place is wild, and I don't even think they can legally just charge people gratuity without notice. Also the online menu is 4 dollars cheaper than the after hours. Just don't go. Absolutely not! I went with a group of friends and i just couldn\u2019t do it. Everything looks unsanitary. My table ordered tons of food and they all complained about the taste and price. Staff was rude which i can deal with. I enjoyed a Corona and that\u2019s it. If you eat here you don\u2019t care about life Great service with happy workers and food packed with flavor, fresh seafood, and great drinks \ud83c\udf78 \ud83c\udf79.  It was my 1st time trying eel, and I loved it. The salt amd pepper shrimp were amazing and the ginger lobster ohhhhmylantahhh definitely will order again. Thank you guys for the extra chips Worth a try to have different rice plates and crispy chicken.\nNot a great place with nice ambience however, the food we tried filled the gap.\nFood portion was good enough for to for a single menu item.\nService was not that great as we would prefer some one to talk a bit and explain the menu and serve happily however, it seemed they prefer more of local clientelle.\nSeafood is definitely overpriced.\n\nWould recommend to try this restaurant for takeaway (choice of rices, crispy chicken and dim sums). Great food! Very authentic. Yet service can be improved and seating is a bit uncomfortable given how crowded the space is I came here for lobsters because they have a special for 2 lobsters for $46 but tbh other than beef chow fen I can't recommend anything else. The lobsters are small but given the price I will let it slide. The satay beef is super weird. They give large portions but they also added clear noodle which is super weird and not very delicious with not enough satay sauce. The steamed giant clam is priced $7 a piece but they basically spread 1.5 clams with a lot of clear noodle to make it look like 3 giant clams with 3 shells so if you do the math they are not as cheap as they make them out to be. I'd rather they charge full price like $10 but gives you the actual full amount. I know this because I cook at home and then I know how much meat is in 1 clam. As for lobster I have a feeling they just cook a bunch and give you pieces with 2 heads but they are alright. The best is beef chow fen which is surprisingly good.\nThis is a cheap restaurant so ambience sucks with noisy diners and crammed seating. Don't take your date unless you've been together for a long time. Service is typical Chinese service fast and efficient but not attentive. A typical Chinese restaurant at Chinatown. Food is served quickly and smells good. We had the salt and pepper lobster and it\u2019s nice. Did really enjoy the chicken but the pickled radish in it is nice. Very nice food and service! It\u2019s a little hard to find, but inside it is big space. Scallions fried lobster, green pepper beef fillet, water spinach, fish head pot are very delicious, the amount is particularly large! The stuff are very kind. Easy to spot location and was my first hot pot experience! The basic broth was flavorful enough and it was all cheap and kept me full! I would definitely go back. Great food and prompt though curt service. Location is easy to find and prices reasonable, solid spot in Chinatown. The service is excellent and fast:  I don't even have to see the menu, they remember my preferences and every single detail. Unlike other restaurants, the wait persons are very fast in responding.\nThe food is fresh and healthy.\nThe price is reasonable but the portion is big with a good variety of vegetables in the Hotpot combo.\nThe place is spacious, quiet, and bright. You'll also have Classical Chinese music in the background. Not too loud like other Chinese restaurants.\nThey also have big round table to do group hot pots.\nIf you like hot pot, this place is one of the best in town. Tried this place out for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered way too much food, but the server was friendly and attentive, and offered suggestions based on what we were in the mood for. Water was never empty, and he checked in in the proper intervals to assure our happiness.\n\nTIP: Get the Roast Beef Scallion Pancake - its Meat and some delicious sauce rolled in a scallion pancake like a wrap - kinda - and sliced into pieces a tiny bit on the greasy side, but unbelievable. I imagine it would make a great hangover meal. Great HotPot spot in Boston. Well priced, and plenty of variety! Huge chinese restaurant with tons of tables for big parties and an event space. There was a wedding going on when we were here! The drinks were good, I got the scorpion bowl. The food came out fast. We got the chicken lo mein, crab Rangoon, general tzos chicken, and dim sum dumplings. Our server was friendly and attentive. Good experience! My wife and I picked up our daughter from the airport early, like 7:30am. Her red-eye flight made her hungry and she wanted dim sum. This place opens at 8 am! (1 of only 2 places serving dim sum) It was fabulous! We took our time with some of the traditional pieces of sui Mai and harguo. Chicken feet came out super hot and tender. You can see the steam from our pork buns. It was 18degrees out and having this with our hot green team warmed us nicely. We were, literally, the first one to sit and eat. Others started to trickle in and we noticed that they were ALL Asian, which is always a great sign. I wish I took some pictures but I was too hungry.\nBTW, the pictures I took were from Lunar New year 2025' Really nice setting inside an old theater that still has a lot of the original features on view.\nWe ordered Dim Sum and found everything fresh and delicious although a couple of dishes were unavailable. I am not going to post any pictures because there are already hundreds of pictures of this beautiful venue.\n\nThe service was fantastic, I love how the carts go around with the food and you get to pick what you want. I enjoyed the chicken feet, the spring roll, sesame balls with lotus, there was a shrimp dim sum and a pork dim sum. It was all delicious.\n\nI absolutely love just looking around the restaurant. I was introduced to the Empire Garden on a visit to China town.  I was told this restaurant has been a staple in Boston for decades.  So I decided to check it out.   The interior dining room is impressive.  It\u2019 an old theater converted into a restaurant!   We were seated and immediately greeted by a friendly server.   She gave us a few minutes to choose a beverage.  I ordered the Mai tai.   It packed a punch!  We ordered the aromatic crispy beef for our entree.  The dish had a generous portion of beef, mixed with veggies and a came with a side of rice.  It was plenty for two people.  If you find yourself visiting Boston don\u2019t miss going to the Empire Garden! I\u2019ve been to Nan Xiang in NYC and felt like this express is definitely worth visiting. Of course it was more fast casual, but the food was still good. Braised Beef Noodle Soup is a must try. Comes with lots of beef and is a lot of food. I was also very happy with the Spicy Beef Soup Dumplings. They had a nice texture, none of them had popped and the beef had a lot of flavor. They were actually fairly spicy, which I wasn\u2019t expecting but I was happy about that. There is a kiosk you can order yourself, or order at the front. Limited seating inside so that can be a challenge depending on the time of day. Perfect spot for a quick and satisfying dumpling and noodle fix.\n\nNoticed this NY-based chain expanding across East Coast cities but never got around to trying it until recently. After ordering it as a late-night snack, I immediately wished I\u2019d discovered it sooner. I\u2019ve ordered twice so far, and every dish I tried has been packed with flavor. The quality was way better than that of typical takeout Chinese restaurants, and more importantly, the prices were surprisingly affordable. My favorites were the Scallion Oil Noodles and the Wontons in Spicy Peanut Sauce, but their beef & pepper noodles and pork soup dumplings were also on par with what I would expect from an authentic Chinatown restaurants. Will definitely be returning to try the rest of the menu.\n\nFavorites: Scallion Oil Noodles, Wonton in Spicy Peanut Sauce\nSolid: Pork Soup Dumplings, Shredded Beef & Pepper Noodles, Pork Chop Rice bowl A really delicious fast casual place to enjoy  outstanding soup dumplings! \ud83e\udd5f We also ordered  pork Wonton in Spicy Peanut Sauce, cucumber salad and the Shanghai Stir-fried Noodles which were all really fresh and very tasty. Scallion Pancake\nwith beef was incredible and definitely a don\u2019t miss along with the soup dumplings. Nan Xiang Express is an absolute gem! Their soup dumplings are delicious! The thin, delicate wrapper holds a rich and flavorful broth that bursts with every bite. The beef noodle soup is just as impressive, with tender beef, tasty noodles, and a savory broth that's packed with depth and warmth. The balance of flavors in both dishes is incredible. The service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting. If you\u2019re craving authentic, delicious dumplings and noodle soup, this place is a must-visit! Great tasting, curated selections of well made dishes with fair pricing. Order by counter, self service. Hot tea and iced water already free. Cannot say enough wonderful things about this place! It was our first time ever having Hot Pot. From the moment we walked in, we were greatest and seated very quickly. The service was immaculate- they wasted no time getting our orders, drinks, utensils, and broths. When we chose our food, it was out within moments. One of the waiters actually took the time to explain how to do everything with recommended cook time and all after telling him it was our first time. I had asked for utensils because I wasn\u2019t comfortable using chopsticks, but we mentioned we wanted to learn. He came back with \u201ctraining chopsticks\u201d he banded together himself to help us. It was SO easy after that. Anytime we needed something, like a refill or extra napkins, the staff was on it. Other than that, The food was delicious and fresh. We were recommended to come here from a friend (we\u2019re closer to Providence!!) and it was the best decision and worth the 1 hour 40 min drive. We will definitely be back. Everything was perfect. Food: not fresh, look like been frozen for long time. Meat is dry, tofu (i dont even wanna describe as u can see in photo). Mala broth not even spicy, everything just bland. Even the fruit is dry bc it stored for a long time.\nService: terrible. They just throw me a paper to choose the food. We sitted for 2 hours but they not even refill the broth for us anytime, while other table they checked frequently. The lady served us give us really bad behavior when I ask something. I dont even know they have bbq or fruit until i saw another table ordered.\nThe price $35/each for diner not worth it overall. I was surprise to see how big the restaurant it is. First time in a place like this one. Great experience and good food. Service was great as well. The only negative point is that is not the cleanest restaurant. Other than that, everything was good. First time at a hot pot. Very unfriendly waiters.  They will be standing in a corner eyeballing the customers. All of everything we ordered as part of all you can eat, the dumplings were the only food item that was good. The broth had no flavor. And most of the meat cuts were not of good quality. We never got any condiments for the meat. We tried to call the attention of the waiters many times but they seem to ignore us the whole time we were there. To me this was just another tourist trap. The place and even the bathrooms look filthy.  Not recommended. Food is delicious but overpriced in my opinion. The servers actively ignore you and avoid eye contact, probably so you won\u2019t order more food so they make more money. Only server that was nice and respectable was a guy speaking Vietnamese with glasses. Anyways, when you pay, servers make no effort to conceal the fact they\u2019re checking out the tip. Like no joke nose first diving to see the receipt before cleaning any dishes out the way. Bring back shame. It\u2019s one of the best vegan spots in Boston. It\u2019s an all vegan cafe. Ambience is great and cozy.\nThe only thing i disliked about the place was\u2014 for entering the cafe, you have to climb the stairs but the area was filled with cigarettes smoke.\ud83d\udca8\n\nMenu is all plant based and they have great dishes. Taste was amazing and delicious!\nThey served us with a tomato-lemon grass soup which was amazing.\nWe ordered yellow curry with mango \ud83e\udd6d which was finger licking delicious!\nWe also tried pad Thai noodles and ginger-tofu which tasted so good!\nEverything tasted amazing!\nServer was very good, polite and very efficient.\n\nThey also have restrooms which were clean. My Thai Vegan Cafe, Boston- Chinatown.\n\nFirst impressions are everything right?  Well, this is not a fancy place.  But you\u2019re here to eat right?\n\nThe dishes we had were standard Thai food. Nothing remarkable however. The Pad  was not very flavorful. But ingredients were fresh. The soups were delicious though.\n\nService is slow. Maybe a because of the holiday and short staffing. No one checked on our table if we needed extra water.\n\nMany choices to eat in Chinatown\u2026.\n\nThis place could be better! This was the most amazing vegan (and general) Thai food I have ever eaten! Amazing presentation, amazing flavors. The Thai mango salad and the fresh mango with yellow curry were in particular so splendidly good! Can't even tell you how many times we have been here over the last 10 years and it still hits. One of the best vegan spots in Boston. My hands down favorite item is the penang curry with mock duck but you really can't go wrong with anything. We tried the sizzler today and it was bomb. Also such a cute ambience with the live plants and colorful lights. I'm thrilled to share my exceptional experience with My Thai Vegan Cafe in Boston. As someone who has traveled to Thailand and experienced the incredible flavors of Thai food firsthand, I can confidently say that My Thai Vegan Cafe upholds the highest standards of authenticity.\n\nFrom the moment you step into the restaurant, you're greeted with warm and friendly service that sets the tone for an exceptional dining experience. The menu is filled with a wide variety of vegan dishes that are bursting with flavor and made with fresh, high-quality ingredients.\n\nI've had the pleasure of dining at My Thai Vegan Cafe multiple times, and each visit has left me thoroughly impressed and satisfied. The flavors are bold and authentic, and each dish is expertly prepared to showcase the best of Thai cuisine without compromising on taste or texture.\n\nWhether you're a vegan or simply looking to explore new and exciting culinary experiences, My Thai Vegan Cafe is sure to delight your taste buds and leave you craving more. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in search of delicious vegan Thai food - you won't be disappointed! Bahn Mi Heaven\n\nIncredible delicious inexpensive bahn mi from this cash only hole in the wall shop in Boston's Chinatown.  Some excellent vegetarian options (tofu and fake beef).  The Vietnamese coffee (hot or iced) is also terrific.  The ready to go fresh rolls are also very very good.\n\nIf I'm in or near Chinatown, this is a must visit for me.  Simply the best. Excellent little Vietnamese sandwich shop and more. I always go here when I\u2019m in Boston. Some of the best Caf\u00e9 Sua Da there is. They always have very good fresh spring rolls, rice bowls and many other fast items ready to go. I highly recommend stopping by. They only take cash but they have an atm From the outside, it looks a little sketchy.  Just look for the name.  There were a couple of people in there, and I asked if they have been there and what they recommended. They recommended bbq beef sandwich. I bought 4 of them, of which 1 was spicy (jalepenos added). The sandwich was DELICIOUS!  The flavor of the  veggies (fresh) and beef was right on point.  Also the bread they used was fresh, flaky on outside, soft on inside.  The only thing I wished they added were more meat and veggie. As you can see from picture, it's hard to see the meat.  But at the price point, you can buy 2.  So 4 sandwiches and 1 thai iced tea cost only $20. For the location, you can't beat that. I am debating whether to go back now and grab more before i leave Boston. Really tasty, inexpensive, banh mi sandwiches. Cash only and only can get to go orders. Fabulous sandwich! Love that they have the option for extra meat or veggies. Bread was crunchy and soft at the same time and flavor was on point! Fresh Mango bubble tea hit the mark too. Service was super friendly. All around great experience. All of this with tax and tip was $30 which I thought was quite pricey for dim sums\u2026so definitely bring 2-3 people to split dim sums with\n\nI liked the shui mai the best, it was plump and juicy and filled with bunch of shrimps and pork filling. Would definitely get that again. It was also the biggest shui mai I ever seen too.\n\nThe chicken feet was objectively good too. I think it was at least 10 chicken feet for $9 which wasn\u2019t too bad? I don\u2019t know it was my first time trying chicken feet\n\nThe thousand-year egg congee is the one I have issues with because it left such bitter taste in my mouth like so gross. Also the congee itself didn\u2019t look quite clean and freshly made so I ended up eating only half of it.\n\nAlso there is $1.50 dimsum charge that\u2019s automatically added to your bill and I think that covers the tea.\n\nBut the restrooms are super clean and the remodeled place is very spacious and nice so I would give this place another try but make sure to bring 2-3 ppl and avoid congee and order other stuff instead Nice quiet ambience. This place served dim sum as well. Quite disappointed with the Hong Kong style Lobster, not the usual style I had before, do enjoy their salted fish fried rice.. I only give this place a 4 star because their dim sum menu, while very good, is limited versus other places . It has all of the popular main dishes but they don't have things like fried shrimp balls and a few other things.  That being said this may now be the best dim sum restaurant in Chinatown. As a young man I spent many moon in Chinatown eating dim sum, roast duck etc. Things have changed as they always do. From what I can tell based on other reviews this restaurant recently reopened. The decor is top notch. The space between tables is quite large so you don't feel cramped. We had a party of 4. It is a failry large upstairs space.  The bathrooms were very modern.  The food they did serve was very good. I debated about which dim sum restaurant to choose on this visit and all of us were glad that we landed on the updated China Pearl Restaurant. Next time I'm back in town, we won't have to debate which restaurant. China Pearl will be the place we go to . Great dim sum, in a beautiful atmosphere! China Pearl used to be the iconic spot for Boston\u2019s Chinatown. We had our wedding banquet there many years ago and recently visited it again. After the renovation, the dining room appears neater and nicer, but the menu is narrower\u2014very boring. It\u2019s no different from any Americanized Chinese restaurant. The food is also disappointing and cannot compare to the old days. It feels like the new generation of leadership focuses more on the look than the food. Wasn't expecting to like the food here so much since it felt a little pretentious but the food was so good. Loved the oxtail chow fun but the pork cutlet was also really good as well! Probably the best spot in Boston for legit Chinese food. The lettuce wrap with beer, fried squid, fish, and beef stew are always a must!\n\nThe fried dumplings are huge. You can bring your own fish here and they'll cook it for a price - absolutely delicious. Just a slight premium at like $15.\n\nEvery time I come back to Boston, I always eat here. Highly recommended. Gourmet asian food.  The food was decent, and the only notable food is the chow fun which the noodle was cooked in its rolled state, and created almost like rice cake texture. A quiet relaxing upscale restaurant in chinatown. Only an eight minute walk to the Emerson colonial theater. The shrimp and walnuts, oxtail chow foon and Moo shu duck were all excellent. The plum cocktail was good. Especially nice ambience with good music at a comfortable volume. The staff is very friendly and efficient. I will definitely return and this is something I can't say about most restaurants in the theater district. We enjoyed every dish here! The Bone Marrow appetizer was phenomenal. My son and brother both love their entrees. Small-medium portions, but very flavorful and delicious. The dumplings were decent, but the skin was a bit dry and many of them had cracked, so there was no soup left inside. Overall, the food was quite good, but we were surprised that the pork dish we ordered was $40+ for such a small portion\u2014especially at a place that doesn\u2019t feel particularly high-end. Still, it\u2019s a good enough spot. We were craving soup dumplings and boy did this place deliver.  Tried a bunch of different ones, thanks rainbow option!  The truffle soup dumplings as well as crab soup dumplings  were my favorites.  Table app ordering was an easy, efficient experience for our table of 5.  Orange chicken was some of the best I've ever had.  Will come back just for dumplings but the Peking duck and the lobster entrees around us smelled amazing as well. Great place for soup dumplings\nThey have lots of (colorful) options\nThe dough did break more easily compared to other soup dumplings I had elsewhere\nOrdering through the QR code works very well and the waiters come to check your order\nThe food was delicious and also liked how it was set up\n\nUpdate early April 2025\nI guess I was a bit too excited\nThey were not able to hold on to their stars the second visit.\n\nAll was just a little off for the orange chicken, the fern noodles and the rainbow soup dumplings\nThe beef dumplings and beef lo mein were the best\n\nWhy 2 stars for atmosphere?\nThe floor near the bathrooms were extremely slippery ans I almost fell. The bathrooms were very very dirty also you can\u2019t see from the outside if they are occupied\nHope they improve the sanitary situation\nWill come back to check it out Fantastic! Great, authentic, delicious food. The dumplings were delightful, so full of flavor and fun to eat. The scallion pancake and fried rice were perfect.\n\nThe service is great and the food is served SO hot!\n\nYou order off the app on your phone as you go and when finished pay out on the app. So take your time, try different things.\nHighly Recommended and if I get back to Boston, I'm def heading back to Fuchun Ju! See how inappropriately the dishes were served in the poorly selected plates. The rice is served with a tiny long stemmed fork, and, the chicken with scallion tastes sour with some odd aftertaste, I suspect msg.  Eggplant was decent, but the flavor is shallow, all of them.\n\nThe rice was served to the individual serving plate that was way too shallow, and the rice grains  are easily tossed to the table and it became  unnecessary struggle and distraction before we enjoyed the food.\n\nThe waiter was uninterested to my polite complaint. And from his reaction, it won't change their poor plating choices. And they never came to ask how the food was or pour the water to our empty glasses.\n\nSo, I asked if the owners are young. Yes, in their 30s. Some decent styles over the actual food taste and how they are served. The experience part is quite lacking. For us, it was a Messy lunch and the food quality was typical for a food court level.\n\n3/5 and disappointing. It is a small cute restaurant in Chinatown. They have good options that you won\u2019t see from other ramen places. The food is just ok but nothing like spectacular. Their Takoyaki is better than expected; and the bun is pretty good . The service is good. waku has a special place in my heart. i have been going here for about 4 years and it has never once disappointed. their food is absolutely incredible. the quality is great, everything comes out quickly and it just gets better every time. the servers are super sweet and attentive, they really make you feel taken care of. my personal favorites are the kimchi, okonomiyaki, duck bao buns, and the curry ramen. if you live in the boston area, you have to make a trip to waku. Quick friendly service and the ramen is insanely good.  Play the spicy pork boa was very good as well.  A+ Probably the best Ramen bowl I have ever had . Really enjoyed my first visit here from the excellent service to the whole ambiance of red lighting and upbeat music playing. The food was fresh and delicious and our party of three each ordered three different flavoured bowls and all three were a hit.\nWill definitely return whenever I\u2019m next visiting the area. We found this Ramen place by accident and I'm so glad we did! The food was so tasty and came out super fast. The sake selections were wonderful and tasty.i would highly recommend for people very into Ramen and people wanting to give it a try. I was absolutely floored by this restaurant. I deeply regret never having tried it in the past 6 years despite passing by it many times and seeing it packed! We had to wait around 13 minutes after joining the waitlist around 6pm on a Saturday. Ordering is very easy to do through a QR code, and they are very efficient at getting the food out and turning tables around.\n\nWe got two mains, one appetizer, and 2 rice for 3 people, and that was plenty (came out to $60 before tip). I liked every single dish including the rice.\n\nThe dish that impressed me the most was the fish fillet with pickled vegetables ($25.95). The fish was plentiful and super tender, with great flavor from the broth and pickled vegetables, but there were also glass noodles and 3 different kinds of mushrooms, which I wasn't expecting. This is a 10/10 dish, and I would absolutely get it again.\n\nThe house special stir fried tender beef ($20.95) was also very delicious! The beef was tender and flavorful, and we liked the bell peppers and cilantro. It was more of a home style dish than the grand fish fillet, but I'm glad we got to try it.\n\nWe also got the black fungus salad ($6.95) which was a delightful way to start the meal. The sauce has soy sauce, black vinegar, sesame oil, and lots of garlic. The rice was also delicious!\n\nHunan Cuisine wasn't on my radar until today, but now it would probably be my top pick for dinner in Chinatown. I'll definitely be back! Perfect place for a great lunch! The portions are huge and the food is amazing. We got the sweet and sour pineapple shrimp, Kung Pao chicken, and chicken and broccoli. Each was the perfect dish, and so easy to share. Add a little of their chili oil to a few bites and you've got the perfect meal.\n\nThe service is always so friendly and kind. They're fast paced, but never overbearing. You never feel rushed at this place, but you also never have to wait for a refill or adding something more. Overall, one of the best Chinese food restaurants in the Northeast! This is hands down one of the best authentic Chinese restaurants I\u2019ve ever experienced. Every dish we ordered was exceptional, with perfect seasoning and bold flavors. The cauliflower cooked with pork was a standout, the spicy fish fillet had the perfect balance of heat, and the clam and winter melon soup might just be the best Chinese soup I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019m already looking forward to my next visit! Authentic Chinese food, fast service although crowded on a Friday evening. The waitresses/waiters are doing their best to serve tables as soon as possible so might look a bit rushing, but it\u2019s understandable since the wait line is long. BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT IN BOSTON. The food portions are decent, the prices are decent, and the food is INCREDIBLE. Tasting incredibly flavorful, fresh, and delicious. We ordered so much food and every dish hit the spot. My favourites are the spicy beef, the fish in sour spicy soup (\u9178\u8fa3\u6c64, this one a tiny bit too salty though\uff09, and the spicy cumin lamb \uff08\u53f8\u5c9a\u7f8a\u8089\uff09. I highly recommend these dishes and this restaurant. You really can\u2019t go wrong. If you like spice, the spice here ain\u2019t bad at all (honestly wish it was spicier). The chic that opened this morning- terrible. Kept the doors locked for an hour after she was supposed to be open\nKnocked on door and couldn\u2019t get my order and she deliberately ignored me and all I wanted to ask was if it was going to take another hour for my pick up order On the weekends, this Dunks is chronically understaffed. What should be a simple order takes 10 extra minutes because only one employee has to handle the cash register, pour drinks, assemble breakfast sandwiches, and bag donuts. I can literally see queues forming up of some guy wanting a single coffee having to wait for 3 meal deals to get assembled, or one person getting his order only for 4 more people to get in line and back up the whole place even more. Order 4 Croissants and paid for them! I was waiting close to 20 minutes just for them to come and tell me they did not have any croissants, I said it was alright and I would just like a refund instead, they refused to give me a refund and said that only corporate could approve refunds and that they were not going to deal with that and instead I should just come back tomorrow for my 4 croissants. Awful customer service, I do not recommend shopping here. You're better off walking one or two streets to downtown and shopping your breakfast/lunch at the one over there Not the greatest fan of dunkin. Sandwiches are not good and their coffee isn't the best. Its cheap, which is nice, but the quality is just not there. The place is clean and the staff is friendly.\n\nBreakfast sandwiches - 2/5. Dont taste that great. Get the job done if you are really hungry.\n\nCoconutmilk Latte - 3/5. Not particularly tasty. Overwhelmingly average Quick and easy. Reviewers run on Dunkin!? On multiple occasions evening staff have been extremely rude and exhibited poor customer service. Collectively, the emergency department is tired of the poor service and rude attitude. The employee refused to give her name and told us to call her the girl with the red hair. She told us she does not care if she gets fired. \u201cThey think I care if they fire me\u201d. People working in this establishment within in the hospital should exhibit better professionalism to those who come to work every day to care for others. Collectively we agree that she should no longer be employed at this location, and she obviously does not value her employment at this location. Also on multiple occasions they have closed early and stop making beverages because they wanted to leave earlier when times for the store are clearly posted. Nice service got help after waiting  about 20 mins for one of my drinks.\n\nThis dunkin's need a bigger spare so people are not on top of each other trying to find there orders and get out of the doors. This is a small nook in the hospital that is not handicapped accessible. The staff is rude but the policies are worse. They won\u2019t sub anything on the menu even if you pay extra. This location is slow, don\u2019t go in before an appt. Ordered a large latte, a bag with cream cheese and a donut at 6pm. 6:45pm go pick up..only the latte is ready.  A large cup has less than half filled latte for 4:56$. Woman there said she didn\u2019t see there was bagel and donut \ud83d\ude44 The best customer service I ever experienced in the dunkin' donuts there's an older woman there that I call ma she is so sweet and lovely person the customer service there is excellent It\u2019s it a nice restaurant, good atmosphere they don\u2019t play music so people can actually talk or do their thing. They have a big menu which is nice, I narrowed down some things I haven\u2019t had tried in most Chinese restaurants anywhere. The tea was good, so was the dumpling. The service is ok, they know what they\u2019re doing. The menu has pictures so everyone knows what they\u2019re ordering. It\u2019s walking distance to the South Station so convenient to eat here while waiting to go somewhere. Will be back sometime Really Good food here every thing came out Hot and fresh with great flavors.Good service also.I would recommend comeing here and it's open late. For a place that unfortunately plastered with Fantuan ads, they really dont have that many coupons when pulling them up on the fantuan app or website... Its ok, that doesn't detract from the awesome dishes served here when we visited! The lobster was seasoned well and steamed accompanied with noodles! We also ordered pig ear which was a nice spicy flavor to it with a little excessive chili oil on it. The rice with the curry was very good too as the rice had a egg or some other thing making it sticky, and it was presented very well along with the clams! The veggies were good too! Service was nice and easy to understand both in english and cantonese. The decoration feels homely and comfortable and would not mind coming back here one day to try their dim sum in the daytime! Jumbo seafood type of restaurants might be common in Hong Kong, but it's a unique experience here in the US, especially at this restauant in Boston's Chinatown. You can almost pet the food you\u2019ll be eating!\nAs soon as you step inside, you\u2019re greeted by the sight and sound of aquariums filled with live fish, crabs, and lobsters, which adds an authentic touch to the dining experience.\nThe menu offers a wide variety of traditional dishes that, for those unfamiliar with Chinese cuisine, can be a bit overwhelming. Thankfully, the waitstaff are incredibly kind and knowledgeable, guiding us through the menu and helping us complete our orders after the first few recognizable items.\nThe dishes we tried were delightful, even if we weren\u2019t entirely sure which sauce went with what. Despite our initial intention to find breakfast, we ended up enjoying an early dinner since the restaurant opens early.\nThis impromptu morning feast made that saturday morning to remember for lifetime. Came in late for dinner , had a fun time watching football and food was good , owners was super nice also !! I will be coming back to try the rest of the menu Had a great experience at Double Chin! The food was absolutely delicious\u2014flavorful, well-prepared, and served fresh. Every dish we tried was a hit, and the portions were generous too. The vibe of the place was fun and welcoming, and the service was friendly and attentive. Definitely looking forward to coming back again soon! Awful food quality. The lobster in the ramen was rubbery\u2014completely tasteless and ridiculously chewy. The so-called Portuguese chicken was just curry chicken; it was nothing like real Portuguese chicken. The passionfruit green tea was the worst I\u2019ve ever had\u2014as Asians who have tried bubble tea worldwide, we know what it should taste like, and this was absolutely terrible. My husband ordered the peach green tea and said it tasted like soap. Since last night, he has been vomiting and suffering from severe diarrhea, ruining our trip as he\u2019s stuck in the hotel sick. I would never recommend this place! Wish I can give negative stars. Not a bad spot to stop after seeing a musical.  The crispy Ramen salad was probably the best dish on the menu. Lobster crabcakes, scallion pancakes, and fried rice are all good. I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the Ramen soup. Kind of bland. Come here for dessert! I recommend the mango flavored shaved ice cream. (it takes two to mango) Tastes yum! A great place if you're looking for cheap eats with big portions. The food was more on the savory side, but it's a good spot if you're hungry. Very simple menu and affordable prices. We tried the pork, chicken (boiled), and veggie dumplings, as well as the soup and scallion pancake. All tasty (the pancake was a little too fried for my personal taste). Beware the seating is limited, but a cpl spots are available. High ratings if simplicity is what you want! Hands down the best and cheapest dumplings \ud83e\udd5f in Chinatown. Less than 10 buck for a big portion of dumplings fried or steamed. They  are very cheerful and friendly service. The dumplings were made fresh, flavorful and mouthwatering. I can\u2019t wait to come eat some more from this place. Highly recommend One of the best dumpling in town. The price is affordable and u can dine in front of the stall. The resto sells different types of dumpling, we ordered the vegetables & chicken.\nThe service is so fast and the workers are so friendly. It\u2019s a small place so the best option is to take a to go order. But I have to highlight that I am obsessed with their dumplings! They are delicious, fresh and 7 dollars ! Love it ! Usually takes 10 min to get them ready. Super recommend ! Talk about value! 10 dumplings for 7 dollars - and they taste delicious to boot. Chewy and hot, but also has some crisp on the skin. This place might be a little hard to find - it's sandwiched between a few other restaurants in this small hole-in-the-wall food court. But this is certainly worth a try :) A rare full-service spot for a hearty Chinatown breakfast.\n\nFor me, there\u2019s something special about starting the day with a hearty Asian breakfast, and this spot is one of the few places in the city\u2014let alone Chinatown\u2014that offers a full-service experience. I like to come here once in a while, especially on holidays, and even as early as 8am, this place could get busy.\n\nLike many Chinatown staples, the menu here is extensive: huge selection of small plates, from dim sum and dumplings to rice rolls and more. Each visit, I try to get something new, and so far, the fried turnip cake and deep fried spareribs were my favorites. Other classics like the Xiao Long Bao and Duck Noodle Soup were solid and on par with the popular spots nearby.\n\nHowever, the bakery section has been a bit of a miss. While the egg tarts are great, the other pastries and cakes were subpar. The cakes have an unbalanced ratio of bread to cream, and the tarts sometimes taste like they\u2019ve been sitting for a day or two.\n\nNevertheless, Great Taste will always be one of my go-to spots in Chinatown. There\u2019s something irreplaceable about a hearty Asian breakfast, and this place delivers that in spades. i love dim sum and i love this dim sum and i love the bakery and i love how no frills, yummy, fast, and fresh this whole experience is. been here a handful of times. during MLK weekend, when the boston common pond literally double froze over, my brother and i mbta-ed twice up to south station to come eat here. we wore every layer possible, two pairs of socks, hand warmers, big coats braved that cold to come eat here. and it hit the spot in every way. the servers were so cute the second time we came they recognized us and welcomed us back and it was really quiet on a tuesday lunch so we stayed long after drinking our full pot of tea and just hung out. pictures are from both visits. the one thing that caught me by surprise was the crab meat rolls because the dough tasted like corn dog batter and i wanted an egg roll wrapper flavor but the taste of the real crab meat more than made up for it. love these egg tarts and fruit tarts. could eat shrimp dumplings for breakfast lunch and dinner and be happy 5ever. A little bakery that if you go to the back and turn around the corner, a little hotspot for dimsum and Cantonese food. The daikon radish cake grilled was great (once they gave us the right sauce), congee was solid, but the ginger tripe and the chicken feet in a \"black bean sauce\" were bland, lacked any flavor. Seating is first-come, first-served, tight little tables, and they give you a menu while you wait so you can order and be ready when you sit down. Most cleverly beautiful strawberry swan creations I've ever seen. Wanted to buy that cake but had disappointingly already ordered a different cake from another store. Ahhh! But I will get this for the next occasion. What we did get were a half dozen red bean sesame balls that were spot on wonderful. I didn't have cash but was spending over $10 and left a good tip.very accommodating. Their hot bubble teas are amazing. Tried the custard tart and mango mochi \"mouthilicious\" \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\nThe staff are very kind and helpful.\nThere are indoor seating area but difficult to find a seat always busy. Taiwan Cafe is no-frills, but all flavor. Don\u2019t expect flashy plating or fancy vibes, just solid food that hits. It\u2019s best enjoyed by stepping outside your comfort zone! Go for the off-cuts and dishes you normally wouldn\u2019t try. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not meant to be eaten this way but I added some of my cold appetizer spicy beef tripe & tendon slices to my Taiwanese pork noodle soup with veggies and it was the perfect fusion. Taiwan Cafe offers a weekday lunch special. Soup, rice, and an entree (from a subset of the menu) for $12.95. You can also order 3 entrees for $34.95 with soup and rice in case you show up with a small group. Note that, if you get the 3-item special, you can also order some appetizers for half off.\n\nToday's soup was egg drop with corn and imitation crab. In classic Taiwan fashion, it was a bit viscous from corn starch. Otherwise, it tasted like egg drop soup. Nothing surprising there.\n\nMy friend and I ordered 2 items from the lunch special to share.\n- L38 \u7b4d\u5c16\u7092\u8089\u7d72 Sauteed Pork/Bamboo Tips\n- L58 \u6e05\u7092A\u83dc Sauteed A-Tsai w/Garlic\n\nBoth portions are smaller than their dinner counterparts, but good enough for weekday lunch. The bamboo tips remained tender, and the A vegetable wasn't too bitter. Both had a bit more oil than I would have liked.\n\nOverall, the lunch special tastes like great value. Nothing extraordinary, but an excellent local place for casual dining. Some of the menu items are hit-or-miss, however. Very friendly and accomodating staff, and surprisingly authentic good chinese food. Generous portions to top it off, and all at a reasonable price too. Fantastic!!! But we definitely got way too much to eat, i suppose we underestimated them.. This was our second time here. We'd had a great experience with the food the waitress recommended us the first but this time not only was our lamb dish sub-par (the meat was rubbery),\nBut we were charged 18% service charge for 2 people. I think that's a little bit too much so diners be warned. Not going back unless the owner has rectified my complaint. Please do better. Good lunch special, tip included in price 18%, food came quick. One of the appetizers I wanted wasn't available. Hot tea as soon as I sat down, always nice touch This small but mighty shop serves amazing piping hot clay pot rice, but with limited seating there may be a worthwhile wait. This spot is perfect for a relaxing meal on a cold day.\n\nFood: Clay pot rice is a very comforting dish and a great way to explore more unique Chinese foods. The clay pot rices we got had the perfect crispy sides that paired well with the more tender proteins that tops the rice. The flavors were on the mellow side but still flavorful, meaning you didn\u2019t need to take breaks besides cooling down your next spoonful. My favorite part was so hot the dish stays as you continue to eat. Even 20 minutes after they were served, the rice was still piping hot!\n\nService: It\u2019s a small operation with 1-2 sweet ladies in the front serving and taking orders. They do their best to accommodate all customers to limit their wait times so sometimes you may end up saying a table with another small group.\n\nAtmosphere: This spot is cozy but can get a little hectic at times given the small space. This isn\u2019t the type of place to enjoy a long drawn out meal. It\u2019s a no fuss stop just looking to serve great food to as many people as they can. This place is very small and has limited numbers of table. They serve clay pot rice with different toppings. The traditional Chinese sausage one is good but others can be a bit unflavored and require you to add pre soy sauce yourself. We added egg on one of the order and found the egg being overcooked. I  can\u2019t say they are awesome but I think out of what you can get from Boston, this is okay. The waitress reminded us about paying tips at the end, which I thought it\u2019s a bit rude. We ordered several dishes for 3 of us... medium eel clay pot rice, small chicken and mushroom clay pot rice, beef in clay pot, and a vegetable dish.  Great flavor. Eel, chicken, vegetables, and beef are all good. I feel the clay pot is mostly rice with not enough protein for the price. The place is really small and packed. A snug and cozy spot serving traditional Cantonese clay pot rice. Expect a bit of a wait for the rice (around 30 minutes), but the crispy texture and fragrant taste of the dish is well worth it. Other dishes like the lamb casserole and vegetables all deliver that comforting, home-cooked feel. Overall, a great stop for some comforting Cantonese food. Nice cozy restaurant, with limited spaces. I tried the yellow eel clay pot for the first time and it was surprisingly tasty. The eel meat was tender and marinated very well. I wasn\u2019t able to finish all the rice though, the portion from a small pot was massive for one~ Been coming here for years for takeout. Recently saw a few table available for sit down but the restaurant is small and not a comfortable space for dining in. The wonton noodle soup is a staple and is fairly good. You can get a variety of meats combination for soup noodles, most commonly the roast pork, chicken, duck or pig. All their roast meats are usually well cooked with good flavors. Service is not friendly but usually efficient. Best chinese resto in town with affordable price. I would recommend the triple items rice platter, since you could 3 types of protein. The platter costed me $15ish (exclude tips) The roasted duck and roasted pork were so delicous, would love to come back to this resto.\nThere were tables for u to dine in.\nThe service was fast, and the employees were so friendly.\nU could also get free water. Triple Meat is my go-to here! Duck, Crispy Pork Belly & Char siu - Quick and easy, comes with rice. Bamboo with Chili is awesome! There are a few tables and chairs you can eat at. Reliable spot for BBQ meat over rice.\n\nBeen dropping by this place for quick bites now and then. BBQ meat places (the kind with ducks hanging in the window) aren\u2019t super common in Boston Chinatown, but this is probably the most popular. Their menu covers a good range\u2014from BBQ duck and stewed beef to Charsiu pork. While not everything\u2019s great, they nail a couple of dishes really well.\n\nMy top picks here are the Pipa duck, Crispy pork, and Char siu pork\u2014though the char siu can be hit-or-miss, especially outside peak hours (best to grab it around opening time). Some of their other meats lean a bit dry, so ask for extra juice or sauce if you can. Still, when it comes to Pipa duck and crispy pork, Hong Kong Eatery is on par with some of the best no-frills BBQ spots in NYC Chinatown. Worth a try.\n\nFavorites: Pipa Duck, Crispy Pork\nSolid: Beef Tendons, Roasted Duck\nDecent: Beef Tripe, Chicken Leg, Beef Brisket I fear the Boston influencers overhyped this place. The food was almost good, but it was room temperature/cold. The crispy pork was good in flavor but a little greasy and the duck was very bony. Server was curt and the seating area was dirty and smelly. The food was cheap and simple and in large portions, so it might be good for some but I will not be returning. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. This hidden gem serves up some of the most mouthwatering dumplings I\u2019ve ever had! From the moment you step in, the ambiance is cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a casual meal or a night out.\n\nThe dumplings are the star of the show here. Whether you go for the steamed or pan-fried, they\u2019re always packed with flavor and perfectly cooked. The pork and chive dumplings are an absolute must-try, with a delicate, tender wrapper and a savory filling that bursts with every bite. The spice level is just right, too\u2014enough to add a little kick but not overpower the dish.\n\nService is always friendly and attentive, and the dishes come out quickly without sacrificing quality. It\u2019s clear that this place truly cares about both the food and the experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the South End and craving some delicious Chinese food with top-tier dumplings, this place should be at the top of your list! Highly recommend! Great service, maki was very good. Fried rice was ok. We came here for a work lunch. my colleagues liked the hotpot option! The pot stickers were goos. This place is amazing! Me and my family go here for birthdays and whenever we get the chance! The food is perfect and is the best hot pot experience I\u2019ve had! The atmosphere and service is where this place shines! There are cool little water stone things everywhere and it looks so cool! The fish and just overall atmosphere is great. The service, oh, the service is incredible! We came here our second time and got Johnny as our server. And he was so nice, never rushing and open to any questions, and about a year later we come back and he remembers who I am. Simply amazing. He even took time out of his day to come talk to me and ask if I thought that my favorite football team, the chiefs, would threepeat. Thankyou Q for a family tradition! Great spot in Chinatown.\n\nLots of veggie hot pot options and it's perfect for a cold Boston Winter.\n\nThe space is big and the servers do a great job of explaining the experience if it's your first time.\n\nThe mai tais are great and STRONG.. We had a terrific experience here our server Johnny was the best. The food was absolutely amazing very flavorful and light but filling. There were so many options on the menu, so hard to choose but every dish left us wanting more! Loved it here and we will definitely be back! I recently visited Liuyishou Hot Pot in Boston, and it was an amazing experience!\n\nThe super - value combo for two is a real steal at just $55.98, and it even includes the sauce bar and soup bases. We chose the Tomato and Signature White Pepper Chicken Soup bases. They were rich and flavorful, making everything we dipped in them taste great. For the proteins, we went for the Prim Beef and Lamb. The meat was so tender that it melted in our mouths. The nine - platter selection offered a wide variety of ingredients, satisfying all our different taste preferences. Tried Liu Yi Shou Hotpot and had a great experience! The environment was clean, and the service was wonderful. We especially enjoyed the duck hotpot broth. We ordered the combo for two, which came with a variety of proteins and veggies. Definitely planning to go back again. The meal was pleasant, the service was very good, and the food was fresh. It was as good as the Liu Yishou Hotpot I had in New York before!We ordered combo for 2\uff0cwe have small appetites, so we ordered two additional dishes, which were just right! This is my go to spot for amazing hot pot! The ingredients are always fresh, the broth options are rich and flavorful, and the sauce bar has everything you need to customize your perfect bite. The atmosphere is lively and fun, which is perfect for group dinners. Always a great experience! When I say you had to ROLL me out of this place, I mean it. My cousin and I were in town and decided to come here after a day of shopping and sightseeing cause we were getting to the point of being hangry. It literally hit the spot and was all we could ask for and more!\n\nThere was a small wait when we got there, but we were on our feet the entire day so 40 minutes was totally okay for us. While waiting, we were already given the iPad to choose our meats, veggies, and other items we wanted for our hot pot. We had decided to get the house specials, spicy and non-spicy, and loaded up on the meats. We were definitely thinking with our tummies and not our minds cause it was just a lot. If you want variety, they for sure have it! We got the beef & lamb platter WITH the deluxe beef platter, and let's just say that was probably better suited for a group of 4-6 instead of 2. Anyway, it was all delicious, and both soup bases were flavorful and properly seasoned. Not too oily either for those who were wondering. The serving staff were also on point. Usually in places like these with so many people and large parties, smaller groups may get lost in the mix, but we were always offered water here and there and asked if we wanted anything else to add. A small thing to point out that I personally appreciated, was that we were handed plastic bags to place our outerwear/bags in so that they wouldn't have that \"hotpot\" smell afterwards. It really did make a difference!\n\nWe also didn't realize this was a chain restaurant, so we'll definitely be checking out the one in Houston soon! Tiny place, amazing ramen!! Also, I've never seen tempura crab stick served like chicken fingers before, and I've been craving more every day since I went here a few weeks ago! Service is great and attentive. It's definitely on my list of places to revisit. lovely place! the TanTan ramen is perfect - a little spice, but enough to enhance the flavor\u2026 small, cozy vibes, great! The food was really good. We did have to wait outside for 20 minutes for a table, but it was worth the wait. The ramen is really tasty, as was the slow cooked pork. The chicken appetiser was good, however the prawn lollypop was very small and over priced in my opinion.\n\nThe server was really friendly and helpful. However after we tipped 15% (which I believe to be fair for this meal), her demeanour completely changed, and she did not utter a word to us from then onwards. super yummy !! cute little restaurant tucked into a corner of chinatown. small menu, but the noodles were so chewy, bouncy, and the broth was flavorful. 110% recommend! note \u2014 cash only. Very good ramen. We got the Kuro Ramen, the garlic flavor was delicious and we liked the texture of the noodles, firm not soggy!! 10/10 They do have two restaurants that are different but same logo and owned by the same person. We went into the other one first and were very confused! \ud83d\ude02 This is a very small Chinese restaurant with only a few tables inside. The main business I guess is take out orders. There\u2019s a big section of barbecue meats. It includes roast pig, barbecue pork, white chicken and barbecue ribs. I\u2019ve tried everything except for the barbecue pork but I knew it\u2019s good. The roast pig is the best. It has really crispy skin and all the meats are tasty. I always ordered barbecue meats on rice bento box which also includes Chinese greens. It\u2019s 11.99 for 1 meat, 12.99 for 2 meats and 12.99 for 3. It\u2019s really worth to order the 3 meats. Remember to ask for extra sauce on rice.\nI always return. I heard their bbq was above average and so we came for late lunch and were seated right away. They have two small rooms and they sat us near the entrance so we were cold every time the door opened. The 2 way bbq rice plate with soy sauce chicken and roast pig with crispy skin was served cold - well room temperature but they are in the entrance area so it\u2019s pretty cold. Portion was on the modest side and the chicken was a bit undercooked for my liking and I am accustomed to the Chinese style of doneness but this was too undercooked. The soy sauce chicken did not have the rich taste it should so not sure they are using a well seasoned master sauce. The roast pig was ok and had a good proportion of fat to lean but the skin was barely crispy and the taste was rather bland. Disappointing bbq. We also ordered spare ribs and bitter melon rice plate and despite the black bean sauce, it was also bland. The yee mein had a nice wok hay and reminded me of my grandmother\u2019s noodles. Service is efficient and place is clean with cute decor.  They have an extensive menu so maybe we will return and try other items. U bet they shine when you are with a large group and order family style. This is hands down the best Cantonese bbq restaurant. You can smell the bbq aroma the second you open the door. The endless line of people picking up bbq, is a testament that this is now the go-to place for many people. Don\u2019t sleep on their stir fry either. Their stir fried dishes that are truly reminiscent of street food in Hong Kong. As a Hong Kong-er, this is the only restaurant in Boston that captures the wok-hei/ smokiness/ sear, fragrance and freshness of dai pai dong. Did I mention they even have TVB playing on tv? Food was very quick, didn\u2019t really understand the menu even though it was translated. We ordered egg drop soup and sweet and sour pork tenders. The food was good, the soup could have used a pinch of salt, and it came out super quick. The place was full of Chinese locals, which usually indicates authenticity. Should have read the reviews before ordering, they have 2 meat plates which looked amazing too. Hot tea was included. Great new place to get authentic tasty duck and other Cantonese delicacies. Menu is huge, and reasonably priced. One plate is in the teens except for specialities just over $20, and is enough food to be satisfied but not stuffed. Atmosphere and service are great, just what you\u2019d expect for a small casual Chinatown restaurant with a big takeout business. Loved the unlimited loose-leaf Chinese tea.\n\nThe duck was amazing and cinnamony but not overly salty or oily. Also loved the pork. The Buddha\u2019s Delight vegetable and noodle medley was great. However, dropped a star because all of the dishes could have used more sauce. Especially the dry chicken and salted fish fried rice that lacked much flavor. I got maybe one bite with a hint of fish.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d come back. After I tried some more places in the area. I\u2019ve found my go-to dim sum spot!!\n\nWindsor Dim Sum Cafe is absolutely awesome. Every dish we tried was packed with flavor and cooked to perfection. The food was fresh, hot, and absolutely delicious. Plus, the service was quick, and the staff was super friendly and welcoming.\nAlready planned my next trip here \u2668\ufe0f Mouthful of dumplings, hot porridge are the key highlights in Winsor Dim Sum Cafe. The portion is decent and price is reasonable. Tastes close to Cantonese dim Sum. I have to admitted it is a surprise with the speed of serving the hot dish. Long queue ahead in the morning and limited seats. I would return when I back to the town Have been coming here for years- and always both food and service are always excellent. Busy on weekends, but turnover in general seems quite efficient. Remember to bring cash. All food is good: this past time we ordered har gau (shrimp), crab dumplings, turnip cakes, lotus leaf, beef Cheung fun and TWO baskets of pork soup dumplings (because they are so delicious!). Also everything is very affordable! Google reviews scared me but Reddit locals swear by Windsor so we stopped in on Sunday for lunch. We loved everything, the staff was helpful with the menu, the hot tea was very good. The dim sum arrived to the table fast and was very fresh! Since there were only 2 of us we did share a big round table with 3 others patrons with no issues. It\u2019s a very small place but we didn\u2019t have to wait. We recommend the soup dumplings, steamed pork buns, sticky rice in lotus leaf wrap, and the scallion pancakes. That\u2019s everything we ordered, didn\u2019t have a bad bite at all. All dim sum was 6.95 per plate. 2 plates per person (shared) was all we could do before we were full. so yummy \ud83e\udd24 me and my friends got the soup dumplings, chinese broccoli, thousand egg porridge, bean curd, roast pork buns, custard buns, and short ribs with black bean sauce! the porridge was excellent, the broccoli was a little oily but had a great crunch, the bean curd was satisfying, the pork was delicious although difficult to get off the bone, and the roast pork buns were fluffy and delicious. custard buns were a bit dry, and the soup dumplings were good but overall not memorable. overall, the bill came out to $80 which was a good amount for three people. We liked the seafood with crunchy noodles, it was great and a huge portion as pictured. The scallion dumplings for dim sum weren\u2019t worth it. The pork buns were! Delicious. And then I got the sesame balls which I thought were delicious as well. Also good spot where we weren\u2019t rushed at all and given tea to chat with I've tried several Dim Sum places, and I think Hei La Moon is the best. Their shrimp dim sum is amazing\u2014any kind! The braised pork dim sum is also fantastic. However, many of the dishes have a strong Chinese spice aroma, which might not be to everyone's taste if you're not used to these scents. On weekends, you can choose your dim sum from carts, which I find very easy and intuitive.\n\nOne thing to note is that most of the employees don\u2019t speak English. I was able to use a few simple Chinese words, which helped occasionally, so don't expect much in terms of friendly service. You can simply order dishes as you see them, without needing an explanation.\n\nIt gets very crowded on weekends, so try to avoid peak times between 11:00 am and 1:00 pm. If you go around these times, you might have to wait 30 minutes to an hour. My go-to dimsum spot in Boston Chinatown. Love the carts that come by during the afternoon with a variety of dimsum choices.\n\nI love the pan fried buns, steamed bbq pork buns, and zongzis are just my comfort food \ud83e\udd5f. The wonton egg noodle soup \ud83c\udf5c is really good with some soy sauce (don't know if that's a thing but it's a personal choice lol).\n\nAll the dim sum are great but the pu pu platter was meh \ud83c\udf62\ud83c\udf57 We used to eat at Hei La Moon many years ago and while visiting Boston this restaurant was on our \u2018must eat\u2019 list. Our opinion is that the new location is much better than the old one, more natural light and it\u2019s cleaner. The food was amazing, better than we remember. We got about 10 dim sum/ appetizers (maybe too much for 3 people) and they were all delicious. My favorite was the egg yolk bun, the flavor is strong and so pleasant. The chive dumplings were very good too. We liked every single dish and appreciated the fact that the taste was different, no 2 dishes had the same spice or taste. Nothing was greasy or cold, everything was perfect. I\u2019m not sure why this place is barely on the cusp of 4 stars. I had a great experience here and the service was fast as well as accommodating. I think it can be hard if you don\u2019t have a Chinese friend with you, but it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s impossible. They have a large variety of dishes and their dim sum is amazing. I loved their fried taro and the pork buns.\n\nI think your experience will really depend on if you get the dishes that match with your palate. Sometimes a good match is more important than popularity or hype and it\u2019s important not to judge a place just because a flavor is not to your liking. If you are looking for dim sum in Chinatown, I would highly recommend. You get a large amount of food for the amount you spend, especially if you bring friends and split. In my opinion, it\u2019s very worth! In fact I was so distracted by the food I forgot to take more pictures lol Nestled in a handsome Beaux-Arts building at 192 Tremont Street, this particular Starbucks serves as an unlikely meeting point of Boston's past and present. The imposing limestone fa\u00e7ade, with its ornate cornices and dignified archways, stands in stark contrast to the modern \"PICK UP\" signs hastily taped to its historic windows \u2013 a telling metaphor for our times, perhaps.\n\nInside, the space has been given what one might generously call a \"corporate spa\" treatment: warm wood paneling, ambient lighting that wouldn't look out of place in a boutique hotel, and enough ceiling-mounted security cameras to make GCHQ blush. The effect is rather like finding a Swedish sauna inside Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe clientele, bundled in winter coats that could double as sleeping bags, shuffle about in what appears to be an interpretive dance ofqueue management. A yellow \"Caution\" sign stands sentinel, less a warning of wet floors than a general advisory about the complex social choreography required to retrieve one's drink.\n\nThe real charm, if one can call it that, lies in watching the silent ballet of baristas navigating their wood-paneled domain with the precision of Swiss watch makers \u2013 albeit considerably more caffeinated ones. Their workspace, a marvel of efficiency squeezed into architectural heritage, somehow manages to produce an endless stream of beverages for the waiting masses.\n\nTop Tip: Visit during off-peak hours unless you fancy becoming intimately acquainted with your fellow coffee enthusiasts. The building's historical details are best appreciated without someone's winter parka pressed against your nose.*\n\nThe verdict? It's precisely what you'd expect from a tired global coffee chain, but housed in a building that deserves better than hastily-applied window signage. Then again, isn't that modern Boston in a paper cup?\n\nPrice: \u00a3\u00a3\nAtmosphere: Architectural dignity meets corporate efficiency\nBest time to visit: When everyone else is at work Love the staff here!!! I have having issues with my app one day.  I showed my normal awesome coffee master Sandra and she helped me fix and had my order done in a snap.  Great location and so friendly... plus they always give my girls a little snack too. I like this Starbucks on the corner by the park. It\u2019s convenient, because you can just take your drink and go to the park afterwards. Staff is friendly, and with drinks at Starbucks you kind of know what you\u2019re paying for already. I liked my drink, they got it out in two minutes which was pretty quick considering how busy it was. Worst starbucks in my 20+ years of starbucks experience, employees are slow, they don\u2019t want to be there and they confuse orders. And guess what, if they your order is screwed you either need to take your mixed order or wait for another 15 minutes until other orders are finished. There are boxes around the store, just an awful awful experience\u2026 I had the best Frappuccino from any Starbucks at this location!!! Thanks so much to the barrista Elise she is so professional and makes a darn good coffee. Will definitely be coming here for my morning coffee! 10/10 Only had a short stay in Boston, but once we discovered this coffee place, we went every day after the initial discovery. Sometimes, twice. The drinks are amazing. The season peach pie chi lattes are amazing. Highly recommend trying it. I also tried the space jam which was also delicious as well as a few others . They even have some boozy options. Overall great experience and coffee options. In Boston's increasingly crowded craft beverage scene, Jaho Coffee Roaster & Wine Bar attempts an ambitious fusion that simultaneously hits and misses the mark, rather like its automatically over sweetened matcha lattes.\n\nThis establishment's identity crisis is both its charm and its challenge. By day, it's a spacious coffee shop with artisanal brews served in Instagram-worthy pink cups adorned with whimsical designs. By night, it transforms into a wine bar complete with craft cocktails and an impressive spirits collection that would make a dedicated mixologist nod in approval. The \"Matchatini\" \u2013 their signature marriage of matcha and martini, epitomizes this dual/multiple personality.\n\nThe space itself is a study in modern industrial-meets-cozy, with soaring ceilings, wooden architectural elements, and pendant lighting that grows more flattering as the sun sets. The refrigerated display case offers an extensive selection ranging from tiramisu to quinoa salads, though one wonders if perhaps a more focused menu might serve better than trying to be all things to all people.\n\nThe coffee program shows promise, with house-roasted beans and skilled baristas, but stumbles on details: that pre-sweetened matcha latte feels like a decision made for operational efficiency rather than customer preference. The wine and spirits selection, however, is thoughtfully curated, suggesting someone behind the scenes really knows their Burgundies from their Bordeaux.\n\nSuggested improvements:\n- Offer unsweetened matcha as the default, with sweetener optional\n- Streamline the food menu to focus on what works best\n- Consider separate day/night ambiance adjustments (lighting, music) to better distinguish the coffee shop from wine bar experience\n- Add table service after 5 PM to match the evening concept\n\nFor now, Jaho remains an intriguing experiment in beverage fusion that's worth watching, particularly after dark, when the club-like atmosphere finally aligns with its ambitious concept. Just remember to specify \"unsweetened\" when ordering that matcha. Such a cute spot! Love all the open tables and bar seating. The screens to self order are great and the staff is pretty nice. Their bubble teas are extremely sweet even if you request it to be less sweet. However the Vietnamese coffee and Scarlett espresso martinis are fantastic and I would definitely go back again for those.\n\nNow for my standard comments. The interior is kept clean and seating is decent. Fabulous establishment. Ordering on the modern kiosks was a breeze. I appreciated their many unique flavor options.\nThe branding / packaging was also exquisite for their hot and cold drink cups.\nThe location had power outlets build into several tables at varying heights. This would be a wonderful location to work remotely, as I witnessed others doing.\nMark the owner was very pleasant - as were the rest of the staff - and shared some insight on the latest batch\u2019s roasts and take home some espresso in bulk.\nDidn\u2019t have a chance to view the bar, but it looked lovely. Would love to return in the future. I recently visited this delightful coffee spot and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of coffee and cocktail options available. The coffee was smooth and rich flavors. I especially loved the cute coffee takeaway cup, adding an extra touch of charm to the experience. Whether you're a coffee aficionado or looking for a unique cocktail, this place has something for everyone. Bizarre experience\u2026 today the cafe was completely empty and an alarm was going off. I waited for five minutes and filmed a video so that I could share with police in case there was a crime incident.\n\nFinally, an employee comes out and looks at me. He says nothing while the alarm still sounds. I asked him what the alarm is about. He didn\u2019t answer, but he turned it off and then asked me, \u201cDo you want to order?\u201d\n\nI ordered three teas. He made them, although I could see that he was making them much faster than usual, he spilled milk, and I\u2019m pretty sure he was skipping steps. As he sealed the drinks, I could see that the drinks were not filled to the top as usual.\n\nI paid and wished him a good day. Again, he didn\u2019t answer.\n\nAfter coming home, I tasted the \u201cTiger Meets Coffee\u201d drink and it did not taste like it usually does. I opened the lid and could see that there was no brown sugar syrup drizzle around the cup like you typically see in a Tiger Sugar or in the advertisements. And I didn\u2019t see any cream mouse either. Attached is a picture of my \u201cTiger Meets Coffee\u201d drink.\n\nThis incident was at 3:50 PM on Friday, Feb 28, 2025.\n\nTiger Sugar is one of my favorite boba tea shops, and this was an unusual experience. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to give it low star rating.\n\nHowever, today was strange and disturbing. I hope that the employee gets any help that he needs.\n\nAs a customer, I should get the drinks I ordered made as advertised, with friendly or polite service. Certainly, ownership should not have customers waiting in an unattended room with an alarm going off for five minutes either.\n\nI hope management will look into the incident and see what the issue was so that future customers have a better experience. This underground dwelling is a gem in the city of Boston. Tiger Sugar has always been good years ago and it\u2019s still good as of today. I absolutely love the brown sugar boba with pudding mix and I typically get it. The boba is also nice and chewy and the pudding adds some different textures which I love. I like that I can request less ice and less sugar but I wish it was the same for all the drinks because the taro couldn\u2019t and I wanted to try it. It\u2019s also not possible to customize the size for the taro, so I especially did not want to drink large, sugary drink. Another small complaint is that they ran out of see-through cups, so I couldn\u2019t locate some boba and I had to take the plastic cover off. Nevertheless, this place is pretty GOATed and I like their milk tea boba and the price isn\u2019t bad at all. worst experience. you guys know cheese form is older then why using it. it cheaper to make it new everyday. I used to drink it a lot buy I guess they don't want repeated customers.\nWaste of money & time. This location used to be my favorite place until today I brought my kids to get 1 chocolate ,  1 pudding , and 1 mango . The mango was fine but the milk teas were the worst.  I dont care about the cups being changed from plastic to paper,  but the taste was completely different comparing to the drinks we got before. There wasn't brown sugar filling around the cup even after I tried to stirred for almost 2 minutes. All I tasted was just like 2 % mike  and not even a full cup .  The staffs before made the best brown sugar milk tea but today only one man making all the drinks by himself. Sorry to say this. Did u train him how to make a good Tiger Sugar milk tea as it used to be  ??????? One of the better boba spots in the city. Great drinks and friendly staff! The #3 Black Sugar Boba with chocolate malt milk with cheese foam (substituted for the mousse) was really good.\n\nThere was also a midweek promotion when we went, buy 2 get one free. The chocolate chip smoothie is a must ! Lots of varieties of drinks & flavors to choose from. They even offer gelato ! It taste amazing, I\u2019m NOT matcha fan at all but I tried the matcha gelato & it was out of this world ! I was immediately obsessed with it, you gotta try it. The best matcha flavor I\u2019ve ever tasted :) def will be returning here every time I visit Boston. I was most impressed with the decor! It\u2019s a great place to sit and have a coffee or dessert. I got an iced mocha and it was really good, the only negative I have to say is the size/price. I thought it was small for almost $7 - but, this is Boston so it\u2019s understandable. I would definitely go back to try one of their desserts or an order of the dumplings they have advertised! Absolutely beautiful cafe with very economical prices.\nI'm surprised this doesn't have more reviews!\nIt has a beautiful vibe and cheerful staff(yes, even at closing time). There were a comfortable number of people here even at 11pm.\nI ordered strawberry milk, and although presentation and taste were good, it could've been better. The strawberry mix inside seemed a bit like a jam and not a fresh strawberry puree, etc, inside. I've made it at home, and it's DELICIOUS.\nHowever, it would still go again because of the low prices and beautiful aesthetic. Maybe I'll like something else better! The cutest boba cafe I\u2019ve been to so far! I got a Thai milk tea and it was more milky compared to others I\u2019ve tried in Chinatown, but I liked it. The deco is really aesthetically pleasing it made me feel like I was in an expensive bar. We were looking for bubble tea. Not for me, it was for my daughter. I still have some self respect.\nJust by chance we came by Darq. We thought it was closed. Outside, two people were sitting and chatting. They said \u201cno no are open\u201d. That\u2019s the owner and his nice daughter.\n\nWe ordered and had a nice chat with the owner, who came 30 years ago from Netherlands for internship and stayed after marrying her hairdresser. (At least he must have saved a lot of money in last 30 years).\n\nThe bubbletea was very tasty said my daughter. The owners are really nice people and the atmosphere was excellent.\n\nWe will come back for coffee! Ordered the passion fruit tea- which was too sweet for me. The drink had some pieces of fresh fruit and jelly. The sugar level could also not be adjusted for this and some of their other drinks. Pretty standard for any average bubble tea spot\u2014 not the worst but by far not the best. Their brown sugar milk boba tea is great! I love the almost smoky flavor. I also like the coconut and oolong one. The taro however is made from powder. Worst Boba in the Chinatown area. The boba pearls are hard and taste like plastic. They clump together so you can\u2019t suck them up through the straw. Ended up giving up and taking off the lid to try and drink the milk, but the milk tea is also watery so I regretted that too. To top it off service was rude as well. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else I'd say they deserve a much higher rating than they have! The staff are super friendly and nice. The place wasn't super crowded when we went.\nWe got the regular boba tea, octopus balls, and taro shake with boba.\nIf you like something fresh, sweet, and boba defo try the taro shake, it was AMAZING!\nIt was also my first time trying octopus but must say the presentation, taste and quality was excellent. Definitely got more value than we paid for.\nThe only con would be not a lot of seating but good to grab and go! Got the large Honey Aloe Green Tea. It is soooooo good and refreshing. Perfect for hot weather. The drink is not too sweet. The toppings is good as well. Will definitely come back. Service is also quick! They are very nice. Their drinks and toppings are satisfyingly made. Download Hungry Panda App to enjoy 99% off on pick up orders on certain drinks with coupons. They also do very nice corn dogs, try the cheetos glazed one.. whee! Table cleanliness can be better.. but the place is nice enough to hang out for half an hour or so with nice long bench and good sized round tables and pouffs. Cute little place and super generous with toppings! I came here after reading about their house made boba, and it was definitely some of the best I\u2019ve ever had. I got sesame boba and red bean, two of my favorite flavors, and couldn\u2019t have been happier. Will have to try the food next time! The boba tea tastes pretty good. There are lots of options and affordable price\n\nThe thing that I like about this place most except boba tea are bathrooms and seats to enjoy drinks and desserts We stopped in here because my son and niece wanted to try the Mochinut. Mochinut are a type of donut. They do not start selling these until early afternoon. We were there at night and bought the 4 remaining Mochinuts. 2 were Blueberry and 2 were grapefruit. I will say they are good. I wasn't sure what to expect with the grapefruit flavor, but it was very nice. We did not try their bubble teas but that will be our next visit here. I will also go there earlier when they have more Mochinuts.  One Zo is located at 83 Harrison Avenue in Boston Massachusetts, in Chinatown. If you enjoy bubble tea and  or Mochinuts stop in a give them a try! Service was slow. Needed more people to work the tea and mochi donuts.  The grapefruit green tea was good and fresh. The house specialty purple sticky rice and mochi ball #8, was disappointing. Tasted overcooked. Not enough doughyness. Got the hello kitty which was pink guava jasmine tea, didn\u2019t really taste 5he pink guava. But the star shaped jellies were cute. They also had snacks like onigiri, and takoyaki. We came on a Friday afternoon, and it was crowded, but you can quickly self-order and then wait. There is a huge variety of fruit flavors. The cold brew jasmine milk tea was perfect, but the strawberry smoothies were too sweet even with less sugar. Excellent! Love it so much. The best boba I\u2019ve had in awhile. We got the apple smoothie with grass jelly and it was absolutely delicious. We also got the grapefruit green tea with 25% sugar and it was of such high quality. We also ate the baked salmon onigiri and the spam one which were both delicious. Yum, yum, YUM! Good boba tea can be difficult to find, and Tea-Do was one of the best we've ever had. Ordered the Honeydew Milk Tea and the Jasmine Milk Tea and both were absolutely delicious and exactly what my husband and I were looking for. We will definitely be back next time we're in Chinatown :) I got the Hulk it\u2019s made with Kiwi, green apple, lychee and jasmine tea with aloe. With ice and little sweet. It was good blend and not overly sweet. I enjoyed it! I also got Tropical Twister it\u2019s made with Mango, pineapple, passion fruit, jasmine tea and lychee jelly. This was great loved this blend even more! Mild sweet but great taste and very refreshing! Both drinks but love Tropical better! Definitely will try again and new one soon! Gong Cha is a real nice milk tea boba shop. Step up to order your drink and wait a few minutes. The all space does get cramped so... The sign to help guide your order maybe blocked. First timers, it's quite simple; 1. Choose your drink, Hot or Cold. 2. Choose your size Medium or Large 3. Add your toppings, Boba, Jelly, Crumbs 4. Choose your sweetness 0 - 100, stay around 30 is enough  5. Choose level of Ice\nThe Green Milk tea with bubbles at 0 was still sweet, whereas the plain tea was of course not. Many things to choose from and a great park to sit and enjoy a few steps away. Gong Cha will cost about $6 a drink $8 if you get a large $10 if additional toppings. I love the set up for covid! They have one entrance and one exit on opposite sides of the building so there is less contact. Though you are free to leave from the entrance I appreciated the effort. You can drink your order inside they have one little area where people were eating inside at bar type seating but only about two people (estimate because I left after receiving my order).\nMedium Brown Sugar Milk Tea (added pearls): Regular sugar and ice. This drink had a very strong roasted/toasted tea flavor and was the favorite of our order today. The milk flavor isn't too strong and for me it wasn't too sweet but if you like things less sweet I recommend 30% sugar since it does also have brown sugar. The pearls were chewy and a little harder than the boba I am used to (still great and not hard just not as soft as I am used to) great if you like chewier pearls.\nEarl Grey Milk Tea with 3 J's (Large): (30% sugar, no ice) This drink was good but had a much stronger milk taste than the Brown Sugar Milk Tea I only got the Earl Grey flavor in the aftertaste. Still great just be aware the tea flavor is more subtle. The three jellies inside were great though I personally couldn't tell a difference (not jelly educated).\nLemon Ai-Yu White Pearl (Large): (no sugar, no ice) Very good, tasted like a juice with added jelly and pearls. Great if you like to join boba runs but don't like tea or milk (like me). Just be aware the white pearls don't have a taste and have a very different texture than the brown sugar/ regular brown boba. I would compare it to a harder/ chewier jelly more than I would boba, though it is also ~100 calories less than regular boba so maybe also good for dieters? Anyways it is great and I personally recommend this drink the most! Very nice tea, dirty brown sugar has nice cream on top, not too sweet just right.\nTaro tastes authentic  tea not with  artificial powder like other places.\nAppreciate they use biodegradable straw too. This place is great. Simple selection. Although I did find it confusing in the beginning that you have to choose several things such as sugar level, ice level, etc. I got used to it very quickly. I ordered lychee iced tea with boba which tasted very good. The straws they had were too small for the boba, but other than that the drink was very good. Highly recommend if you're around. it was very good. but my friend got the strawberry Boba and it was nothing alike the picture although it was very good and affordable and the new gingerbread cups, well they ran out Look, I don't know if this is the best location for a boba place, being that it's across the Boston Symphony and it's mostly older people who frequent the symphony. But as an Asian family, we did go to the Symphony and we did drop by this place afterwards for that post-symphony boba hit. LOL. Such a cute spot, a hidden gem! Really great selections on milks and tea\u2019s. Definitely come on in and grab something. The boba was hard to get into my straw. Also had a weird texture towards the end and made me wonder if it was a ball of spit. I got the Oreo Wow. The strawberry matcha looked odd. I had this drink from another location just yesterday and nowhere near this bad. They also gave me a drink that had matcha on the side and I couldn\u2019t be confident if the top was opened or not. i got 2 plain ol\u2019 Thai milk tea for $13.27 to be exact. The girl at the register just looked completely over it . i can\u2019t blame her too much it was probably a long day for her(we\u2019ve all had those days).. as you can imagine tho my interaction with her was very limited even tho i was a bit confused over the coconut or the thai.. I went with the THAI milk tea and ended up getting MILK TEA with a hint of thai tea! the Thai flavor (which is very strong) was non existent . i normally like Kung Fu Tea at the Rhode Island locations but this one i will probably not return.. the atmosphere was very nice & welcoming i give that 5stars . Lovely Kung Fu Tea. Near MBTA. Good Environment. Open till 11pm.\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udef0\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd70 Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. Bizarre experience\u2026 today the cafe was completely empty and an alarm was going off.

Still great just be aware the tea flavor is more subtle. The three jellies inside were great though I personally couldn't tell a difference (not jelly educated).\nLemon Ai-Yu White Pearl (Large): (no sugar, no ice) Very good, tasted like a juice with added jelly and pearls. Great if you like to join boba runs but don't like tea or milk (like me). Just be aware the white pearls don't have a taste and have a very different texture than the brown sugar/ regular brown boba. I would compare it to a harder/ chewier jelly more than I would boba, though it is also ~100 calories less than regular boba so maybe also good for dieters? Anyways it is great and I personally recommend this drink the most! Very nice tea, dirty brown sugar has nice cream on top, not too sweet just right.\nTaro tastes authentic  tea not with  artificial powder like other places.\nAppreciate they use biodegradable straw too. This place is great. Simple selection. Although I did find it confusing in the beginning that you have to choose several things such as sugar level, ice level, etc. I got used to it very quickly. I ordered lychee iced tea with boba which tasted very good. The straws they had were too small for the boba, but other than that the drink was very good. Highly recommend if you're around. it was very good. but my friend got the strawberry Boba and it was nothing alike the picture although it was very good and affordable and the new gingerbread cups, well they ran out Look, I don't know if this is the best location for a boba place, being that it's across the Boston Symphony and it's mostly older people who frequent the symphony. But as an Asian family, we did go to the Symphony and we did drop by this place afterwards for that post-symphony boba hit. LOL. Such a cute spot, a hidden gem! Really great selections on milks and tea\u2019s. Definitely come on in and grab something. The boba was hard to get into my straw. Also had a weird texture towards the end and made me wonder if it was a ball of spit. I got the Oreo Wow. The strawberry matcha looked odd. I had this drink from another location just yesterday and nowhere near this bad. They also gave me a drink that had matcha on the side and I couldn\u2019t be confident if the top was opened or not. i got 2 plain ol\u2019 Thai milk tea for $13.27 to be exact. The girl at the register just looked completely over it . i can\u2019t blame her too much it was probably a long day for her(we\u2019ve all had those days).. as you can imagine tho my interaction with her was very limited even tho i was a bit confused over the coconut or the thai.. I went with the THAI milk tea and ended up getting MILK TEA with a hint of thai tea! the Thai flavor (which is very strong) was non existent . i normally like Kung Fu Tea at the Rhode Island locations but this one i will probably not return.. the atmosphere was very nice & welcoming i give that 5stars . Lovely Kung Fu Tea. Near MBTA. Good Environment. Open till 11pm.\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udef0\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd70 Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny."

    "reviews": "Make this place your go-to barbershop. It was my first time in today with Miguel for a cut and fade. He is truly a master in this profession. I didn\u2019t really know how to say what I wanted but he knew all the right questions to ask and then got right to work on it and did an amazing job. I was in and outta there in less than 20 minutes. This is a really great neighborhood spot right off of the orange line and I highly recommend you trust these guys to be your barber. I won\u2019t be going anywhere else. Thanks again Miguel! Miguel and George are not only skilled and professional barbers, but also great neighbors. For the past two years I have cut my hair with them. They are (still) very attentive on what I am looking for in each cut, delivering with effectiveness and style. Miguel is the man. So glad to have found him, now the only person I trust with my haircuts. I've been seeing Miguel for over ten years, and he's always done a great job, even with some complications that have come up with my hair. Does great kids cuts in a Thomas the Tank Engine chair too! Note that the shop is cash-only. George and Miguel are the best!  I've been going to them for almost 20 years.  The best in the business. My favorite barbershop in Boston! Always clean, welcoming, and just a great vibe. Jill is incredible! I've been going to her for close to 3 years now, and every haircut keeps getting better and better. She's personable, talented, and always works with me to get the best haircut depending on how I'm feeling. Always impressed, and highly recommend coming here for your next cut! Haircuts with Jill are the absolute best I\u2019ve gotten in my 10 years living in Boston. She makes sure to understand exactly what you want and executes with precision, all while being so very enjoyable to talk to! She is consistent every time, and I always went in certain that she would be able to flawlessly execute any short style I wanted (skin fade, mullet, etc). I can\u2019t recommend going to her enough.  I\u2019m SO disappointed I won\u2019t be able to get my haircut by her anymore since moving! Thank you for everything, Jill! Barbershop Deluxe is a welcoming and comfortable spot with a great atmosphere. Christina did an amazing job with my haircut, nailing exactly what I was looking for. She provided great product and maintenance recommendations and communicated clearly throughout the process. Highly recommend both the shop and Christina for a top-notch experience! Absolutely amazing service. My barber, Drew was attentive and learned my hair before letting me ruin it with a bad idea. Lined me up beautifully and even cleaned up my mustache without me asking as a first time customer. Definitely going to be back. This place is a must hit, if you can book with Drew, don\u2019t hesitate. Justin Simas has been my Barber for the last 2 years and I couldn\u2019t recommend him more! He is a great guy and gives the best haircuts. I struggled to find someone that I trusted to cut my hair and I am glad that I found someone who listens to what I want and is able to execute it with perfection. I feel so lucky we went to this store! The staff is exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly, and the manager Yao is an expert in all things baby, especially strollers. Customer service is impeccable and we ended up getting our stroller, high chair, car seat, and carrier from Tadpole based on their expert recommendations. Given how overwhelming it can be to pick out key items for first time parents, I could not recommend Tadpole more highly for their knowledge, care, and ease of working with them in every aspect! Had a great experience my first time at Tadpole! I went near closing on Saturday and the staff was kind enough to allow me to browse even after closing time. I didn\u2019t even purchase a stroller, literally just a jellycat (their selection is amazing)! Give them your business kindest staff around, great products too We love Tadpole Boston! When my husband\u2019s job relocated him, they helped us every step of the way picking a stroller that would fit our needs outside of the city. As I approached bedrest, they thoughtfully helped install my car seat, teach me how to use the products, and go over it with me a million times in the hot June heat. Now that our baby is home and the nuna winter seat cover is back in stock, we will be ordering from our favorite small business to the PA/NJ area. Their customer service and their products are the best and we are so loyal! As a mom of four young kids, who has lived in Boston for over a decade, I can say unequivocally that Tadpole is by far the best store for children in Boston! It has everything you need as a parent ranging from the safest car seats to the most creative toys. The owner, Ana, is knowledgeable, warm, and friendly. She makes shopping for your children a pure delight! She and her husband are also experts on car seat safety, and the store sells very safe, highly rated, and comfortable car seats. They were so kind to spend literally hours helping my husband and I figure out how to install four car seats in our car (not an easy task!!) We could not have figured this out on our own. I feel so secure and confident knowing that Anna and her husband helped ensure that our kids are safe in their car seats when we drive! Ana is also an incredible person. She spent a lot of time teaching my son (who has an interest in car seats) about car seat installation. She brought him so much joy! Thank you, Ana, from the bottom of our hearts for your kindness, warmth, and expertise, and for having a store that is an extraordinary resource for all parents!! I am a seven-year-old customer of Tadpole and I think Tadpole is the greatest store in the universe! After I first discovered Tadpole, I asked my mom whether we could go there every day because we loved it so much! Tadpole not only sells incredible toys but also has the best owner in the world: Ana. Ana is so friendly and kind and is also an expert on toys, car seats, strollers, and everything related to children. My family needed a car seat for my new baby sister and Ana spent hours talking to me and my whole family about car seats. She is a Child Passenger Safety technician (CPST) and an extraordinary expert on car seats. She and her husband were so kind and patient to help my family install our car seats safely and correctly (which is a very difficult task). Ana is so kind and knowledgeable and her store is so amazing that if it were up to me, I would live at Tadpole! Thank you, Ana, for providing your incredible store to kids like me who live in Boston! We adore your store! The team at D\u2019Tails from daycare to grooming have been taking care of my baby girl since we got her over 3 years ago.  Unless I move out of the south end I would never choose anywhere else to go.  They take such good care of her and make her look beautiful every time. Melissa is truly the best groomer I've encountered! My little doodle has never gotten a better haircut. So thankful to have found her. And the customer service at D'Tails is great, 10/10 overall experience here. We send our frenchie Sofie to D\u2019Tails for daycare and she LOVES it! She starts sprinting as soon as we turn onto the street. I am always so impressed that everyone on the D\u2019Tails team knows her name and recognizes both me and my husband when we come in to pick her up - even the owner! They treat her like a princess, carrying her up the stairs when she is too tired from a day of playing to climb up them herself. They even send her home with a bag of goodies on her birthday! They text picture updates in the middle of the day which I love to get while I\u2019m at work. She recently started getting groomed with Bertha at D\u2019Tails and Sofie smells fresh and clean for weeks after her bath. Sofie is obsessed with Bertha! The entire team is professional and just wonderful - it\u2019s clear they love our fur baby and take great care of her! We only have great things to say! I will always take my dog Pippin to D\u2019tails. I cannot say enough good things! The staff is amazing and always goes above and beyond. You could not find a more professional and experienced team! I always know my dog is in the best hands and is safe and well cared for when she is there. I will always recommend D\u2019tails! Five Stars and a Tail Wagging Recommendation for Dtails\n\nI've been bringing my dog, Rose McNugget to Dtails for years now, and I can honestly say I wouldn't trust anyone else with her grooming. Over the years, Bertha and Dawn have become more than just groomers \u2013 they're like family.\n\nRose McNugget is now a senior dog, and with age comes a little more sensitivity and a need for extra gentle care. Bertha understands this perfectly. She is incredibly patient and always prioritize Rose\u2019s comfort. She knows her quirks and how to make her feel completely at ease (me too!)\n\nWhat truly sets them apart is the genuine love and care they show every animal that walks through their door. Rose McNugget loves her visits! She is always happy and relaxed when I pick her up, with a perfectly groomed coat and a big smile.\n\nFor a senior dog, or any dog for that matter, finding a groomer you can trust is invaluable. Knowing that Rose McNugget is in such capable and loving hands gives me complete peace of mind. If you're looking for a groomer who is skilled, compassionate, and truly cares about your furry friend, look no further than Dtails. You and your dog will be so glad you did! Celeste is amazing!!\n\nI am so so happy that my roommate found Celeste online because I just had my haircut with her a few days ago and I am absolutely in love with my hair! She made my vision come to life even though my hair was much shorter from the inspo pics I showed.  She retained the length of my hair when I asked her if it was possible and gave me the layers that I wanted. She also fixed up my bangs and blended it nicely with the layers.\n\nShe was so welcoming which made my nervousness go away as it was my first haircut outside of my mom doing it for years. She was so patient with all of my questions about hair and our conversation just flowed so nicely and before I know it, my haircut was done! I absolutely love her and the haircut she did on me.\n\nI will for sure come back when I need to get another haircut and will for sure be recommend her to my other friends.\n\nAlso, everyone from the Blackroom Salon were super nice! I definitely enjoyed my time there. Lex was AMAZING!! Have already recommended a friend to get her haircut by them. My main concern was my HEAVY THICK hair that would give me intense headaches. My hair still looks so voluminous but with half of the weight. No more headaches! A true miracle worker. Prior to this I hadn\u2019t gotten a haircut in about 8 years, but now I will definitely be back. My expectations were exceeded and I was very comfortable! 10/10. Had my first appointment at Blackroom this week. Kori was an absolutely wonderful human and I love the haircut she gave me! I\u2019m also super pumped to come back to have her color my hair.\n\nCould not recommend this salon enough - the vibes are great, the staff are great. It\u2019s all around good vibes. Went to Blackroom looking for a hair consultation and cut and am so happy I did! Brooke was super talented and took time to listen to what I was looking for and answer all of my questions. She gave me my favorite haircut I've had so far\u2014100% recommend! My favorite salon! I\u2019ve seen Jenn for my last three appointments and she is fantastic. She was realistic with me about what levels my hair can lift to and she exceeded my expectations! The salon itself is super nice and well decorated, and the people who work there have been nothing but kind, funny, and welcoming. Thanks for helping me love my hair again, Jenn!! The owners of the Picture Store were great to work with.  The shop has a large stock of options to choose from and the owners were very knowledgable and thoughtful in helping us choose the right frame for a very large oil painting.  The framing was beautifully  done and ready on time and they offered to go above and beyond to help us with some logistics of dealing with this large canvas.  We recommend this shop very highly. I worked with Adam on a custom project for my wedding (photo attached) and they were professional and kind throughout. The finished product is exactly as I envisioned. Highly recommend this shop. They did a great job... advice, execution, etc.  Felt good to support local business.   Happy to do so when the quality & friendliness is there. I stumbled upon the The Picture Store after many years working with other frames in the city. I have completed two significant framing projects, for my clients, working with Adam, and the results have been outstanding. I highly recommend The Picture Store for all of your framing projects. Store is easily accessible, they have a large inventory of products to go through to find exactly what you are looking for for your project, and Adam is wonderful to work with. And finally, your project is ready when they say it will be ready! Incredible attention to detail! The owners are friendly and know their stock intimately. You can get an amazing framing job done at a superbly reasonable price! went this past weekend to see N\u00fcwa in Fairyland!! such a good show and cast, it was Queer AAPI night so i got to see lots of other queer AAPI in the audience \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c loved the atmosphere and their blackbox theater! I attended a fiber show inside of this space a few weeks ago and it was lovely. It\u2019s spacious and has beautiful architectural details within the interior. I volunteered at the Boston Art Book Fair and it was a great experience. The environment is really positive even when it\u2019s busy and I got to chat with some of the exhibitors and there was so much cool work to see. Great space for a small theater performance hats off to the Evil Dead Musical HD There are gender neutral bathrooms here. Masks are required. There are stairs and a wheel chair lift. The Booth Theatre at Boston University has great acoustics and seating.  Audience members get a good view from any seat in the theatre.  The location is more convenient for BU students than the old space at the Huntington. This theater is across from Boston University. It's intimate inside. We were there to see my son perform in an opera staged by Boston University's Opera Institute. There are lots of restaurants and bars nearby on Commonwealth Ave. Support the arts! What a beautiful theater! Small, but acoustically perfect. The performances were wonderful. Every bit as good as the famous opera houses in New York City. Look forward to seeing more shows here. Bravo! Marcus; Or The Secret Of Sweet was amazingly performed by Boston University CFA School of Theatre. Hats off to a great cast and director. This is a great space, with wonderful performances. I saw \"And jesus moonwalks across the Mississippi\" and loved it. The space has great sound and flexibility for set designs. I wish it was equipped with screens on the sides of the stage to dosplay subtitles for those who are hard of hearing. They have Broadway \ud83c\udfad quality shows .  They have a parking garage within walking distance .  They have snacks for sale on a cart along with alcoholic beverages.  This place is immaculate on the cleanliness level , Including the bathrooms. Outside of the establishment they have many restaurants.  The show we saw was spectacular \u201c stand up if your here tonight \u201c.  The prices are great for the quality .\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc The staff are very accommodating. The ballet dancers were phenomenal. I am looking forward to seeing scream Queens. Great little theate. Parking garages within 5 minutes on foot.  Decent prices. The \"bar\" was more of a cart with cans they will open for you for 10-15 dollars. Multiple food options across the street including chains like panera dunkin and five guys. The bathrooms were downstairs and extremely clean. Plenty of staff and volunteers guiding people in and to their seats. Definitely a place I would go again. This is a great theater. Small enough that most every seat offers a great view. Awesome professional performances. Beautiful show. Wish it was longer. Dancers were amazing! Very disappointed to find out that performances at the BCA Plaza Theatre do not regularly offer audio descriptions for performances.\nAlthough it is clear on their website that they place the responsibility of AD on the performance company to make those particular arrangements, it is below expectations that at least one performance is not supported this way (as done by other theaters in the greater Boston area).\nBecause this is show-to-show dependent, we will be avoiding any show that takes place at this theatre.\nI would also encourage the BCA to clarify their accessibility options, or lack thereof, to their box office regarding this particular theatre. When I reached out regarding this, they had no relevant information on this topic. Went to see the Evil Dead Musical. The venue is small, so it really doesn't matter where you sit. you'll have a great view from everywhere. Show was halirious! We sat in the \"splatter zone\" but did not end up getting anything on us, so I wouldn't spend extra money just for that unless you get  front row seats. We ordered wings and pizza.  The pizza was meant to be pepperoni, Bacon and fresh garlic. (They only list roasted garlic as a topping, but did say they had fresh.) The wings came, which could have done with additional seasoning, because I tasted pretty much none. The pizza came, but we were informed there was a misunderstanding, and it didn't have any garlic in it. They gave us the pizza anyhow, and then remade one with the garlic on it. They were very pleasant and we loved the pizza.\n\nWe arrived when they reopened for their afternoon restart, and we were with the first \u00bd dozen customers. Place filled up quickly after that. Not inexpensive, but very tasty. Would repeat.\n\nThey're opening another site in Marlborough(?) Next month. Not sure if their new location will support the same pricing. Both the pizza and the mac and cheese were great. I liked the Sausage, Fennel, and Ricotta more than the Alsatian, but both were packed with flavor. Some parts of the crust were too charred to eat, though.\n\nI appreciated the half size for the mac and cheese\u2014anymore and I would have gotten sick of it due to how rich/heavy the cheese was. First I\u2019ll start by saying how excited I was to read the description for the pizza \u201cextra crispy with char\u201d. However, that is NOT what I received. I expected an extra crispy pizza, charred. No, I got a barely well done pizza, cold. Not to mention the pepperoni was sweet and not the way pepperoni was supposed to taste. If you plan on ordering and want an extra crispy pizza, you might want to request extra crispy.. also, not worth $25\u2026. A lovely and unassuming pizzeria and ice cream parlor. Both pizza (mushroom, Swiss chard, and fontina) and ice cream made in-house (chocolate malt with dark chocolate chip, not pictured) were amazing!  I will definitely be back! Picco is always great. Usually a little crowded but thats a good thing for business. This time we decided to order to go so we would not have to wait. The pizza and mac  is usually always on point but this time we ordered chicken wings and was completely turned off. Maybe it was on oversight when washing the chicken but the question i have is, is this normal for their chicken. Why is their still feathers! Did you not see them when cleaning, seasoning, cooking, saucing or even when younplaced them in the box or is this normal! Charges like a fancy restaurant, feels like a fast food place.\nFood came extremely fast - too fast. I felt like I was rushed as dishes would appear so quickly. At an average of $20+ per dish, you want to be able to enjoy it but because food came so fast and the portions where bite size, we all felt rushed. All the flavors where on - Dan Dan was odd without the spicy oil but it was spicy (as I asked). I added one star for flavor otherwise I would have given it 2 stars Service and atmosphere were great, but the food was very average especially for how expensive it was. Everything we ordered had hoisin sauce on it (scallion pancakes, pork bao, octopus) to the point where it all had the same flavor. The octopus was also oversalted. We also ordered the lettuce wraps, but the lettuce was cooked for some reason, resulting in a soggy and disappointing wrap. Beautiful presentation and atmosphere, but the food just wasn\u2019t up to par. Such a cozy and vibey place! The decor and music was on point! The theme is banyan so the decor matches that completely. A lot of the dishes can be made vegetarian so its a good place if you have vegetarians in the group as well. The food was pretty average nothing great for the price. Banyan has unique takes on fusion with dishes like fried chicken bao. I thought that all the food tasted pretty good. I liked how the crispy rice with the tuna was crispy on the outside but gooey on the inside. The pork noodles were wayyy too salty though and you were just overwhelmed by salty ground pork.\n\nThe cabbage wraps were flavorful but hard to eat given their size, however, the pork ribs came right off the bone and were delicious. As for desserts, the chocolate cake was interesting but not bad and the cr\u00e8me Brielle was also decent. All in all I had a good experience here and it\u2019s a pretty cool spot with some dishes shining brighter than others. I say this as a Southeast Asian American\u2014 I RARELY find Asian fusion spots that I enjoy, as they usually cater towards white Americans. The food was delicious with a  twist while paying homage to the cultures in both texture and taste. Banyan hit the nail on fusion, and that\u2019s what sets them apart.\n\nEvery drink I tried I enjoyed (again\u2014 rare), and pairs well with many of the dishes. The dandan noodles aren\u2019t spicy as I was hoping but still yummy. The larb cabbage wraps were super comforting to eat (mind you, its a steamed cabbage not raw), and the salt pepper shrimp were surprisingly amazing (the best part was how sweet and tangy the paired sauce was). the bulgogi frites is sweeter than i expected, but my friends loved it.\n\nGreat ambiance, cozy lighting and intentional vibes. New favorite spot, I will 100% be back here. Sunday brunch had a nice vibe, we were seated pretty far from the live band but still a fairly good atmosphere. The Sweet Nuthin cocktail was the best I tried here, not too sweet with good flavor!\n\nThe coffee cake was okay, not a must try. The honey butter was very frozen and did not melt at all sadly, won\u2019t get again. But, the Shakshuka was pretty good, different than the typical Mediterranean ones you find around, really enjoyed the polenta with it! Overall, food wasn\u2019t very impressive, but the music and cocktails were lovely! Would have been a 5* for the music; loved the venue and we got great seats. My lamb chops were burnt and inedible, so overall have taken a star off. I\u2019d go again and just have cocktails with the fantastic live music! From the moment Juan Paolo welcomed us to our last cocktail, this was an extraordinary experience. The food is elevated and sublime. Flavors complex and well balanced. Best margarita of my life, and I\u2019m rethinking how we make espresso martinis.  Genial service, and a lovely atmosphere where the staff clearly enjoy their work and each other. You will enjoy every aspect of this delightful restaurant. Went here for Valentine's dinner and had an excellent time. There was live music when we went, starting at around 9pm. The appetizers came out about a minute after we ordered, which is probably owed to the prix fixe menu they had for the night.\n\nThe Jamon and Machego Croquettes were tasty and gooey\nThe whipped feta dip with vegetables was fine, a bit plain but nothing wrong with the dish\nThe butternut squash truffle risotto was very tasty, decent portion and the butternut squash was a nice addition. Also a bit spicy which I liked\nThe prime rib was excellent, it came with mushrooms and truffle and mashed potatos. One of my favorite dishes anywhere.\nThe passion fruit cheesecake was tasty, had a nice crisp crust\nThe chocolate mousse cake was decent, it was fine but not special.\n\nWe also got a bottle of red wine for 60 bucks.\n\nThe final price was 350, with 20% tip. The base prix-fixe price was 105. I thought it was a very good meal with nice atmosphere and staff, but the food items should have been about 70-80 per person at this caliber of restaurant rather than 105. But there's not much better experiences I've had in Boston so if you have the money, definitely go! Bitter brisket. We came here for a birthday to enjoy some live music and good food. The vibe in the Beehive is very cool to start. We got sat in the area closer to the stage, which we wanted, but it was a bit cramped. I was excited to try the brisket as it sounded delicious, but was sadly disappointed. It was bitter to the point I couldn't eat it. Espresso level bitterness. It was clearly over smoked and that was quite unfortunate. I didn't particularly enjoy the sauce either. The potatoes I had on the side were the best part of the meal, although I didn't enjoy them much either. The service was good and I didn't have any issues dining here with my gluten allergy. Unfortunately, I probably would not come back. What a fantastic place for breakfast! We were a party of 4 adults and 4 kids looking for a place to eat breakfast on Sunday morning.   It was about a 30 minute wait but they let us hang out at the bar and served us some very fine coffee.   Such friendly staff with great ambience!  Food was enjoyed by all 8 of us.   Everything was fresh and served warm.  Definitely will keep this place on our list the next time we visit Boston! The drinks were on the expensive side.  I ordered the Lobster Benedict special and give it 4 stars. The eggs were cooked perfectly and blended well with the rest of the ingredients on the plate. My only criticism was that the biscuit was a little dense.  The standard eggs Benedict with chorizo was also a delicious option.\nIf you have a sweet tooth, the chocolate chip pancakes with a delicious, mango butter was an excellent option.\nThe tequila and cilantro cured salmon cream cheese quesadilla is another excellent option with a deciduous arugula pico salad on top. It was a unique take on the classic bagel with lox. I love their brunch menu. It was reasonably priced. Dinner is also great but my salad had a random pepper flakes that caused my date to choke. \ud83d\ude05 It was a nice place to have drinks and dinner with friends. The bartender was very friendly and drinks were good. The food was very delicious. The service was very friendly and satisfying. Came for the brunch, stayed for the tequila! Definitely recommend the pomegranate tequila sunrise and the scrambled eggs! The tequila/mezcal menu is outrageous in the best way possible. Can't wait for my next trip to Boston so I can visit again Sunday brunch had a nice vibe, we were seated pretty far from the live band but still a fairly good atmosphere. The Sweet Nuthin cocktail was the best I tried here, not too sweet with good flavor!\n\nThe coffee cake was okay, not a must try.

But there's not much better experiences I've had in Boston so if you have the money, definitely go! Bitter brisket. We came here for a birthday to enjoy some live music and good food. The vibe in the Beehive is very cool to start. We got sat in the area closer to the stage, which we wanted, but it was a bit cramped. I was excited to try the brisket as it sounded delicious, but was sadly disappointed. It was bitter to the point I couldn't eat it. Espresso level bitterness. It was clearly over smoked and that was quite unfortunate. I didn't particularly enjoy the sauce either. The potatoes I had on the side were the best part of the meal, although I didn't enjoy them much either. The service was good and I didn't have any issues dining here with my gluten allergy. Unfortunately, I probably would not come back. What a fantastic place for breakfast! We were a party of 4 adults and 4 kids looking for a place to eat breakfast on Sunday morning.   It was about a 30 minute wait but they let us hang out at the bar and served us some very fine coffee.   Such friendly staff with great ambience!  Food was enjoyed by all 8 of us.   Everything was fresh and served warm.  Definitely will keep this place on our list the next time we visit Boston! The drinks were on the expensive side.  I ordered the Lobster Benedict special and give it 4 stars. The eggs were cooked perfectly and blended well with the rest of the ingredients on the plate. My only criticism was that the biscuit was a little dense.  The standard eggs Benedict with chorizo was also a delicious option.\nIf you have a sweet tooth, the chocolate chip pancakes with a delicious, mango butter was an excellent option.\nThe tequila and cilantro cured salmon cream cheese quesadilla is another excellent option with a deciduous arugula pico salad on top. It was a unique take on the classic bagel with lox. I love their brunch menu. It was reasonably priced. Dinner is also great but my salad had a random pepper flakes that caused my date to choke. \ud83d\ude05 It was a nice place to have drinks and dinner with friends. The bartender was very friendly and drinks were good. The food was very delicious. The service was very friendly and satisfying. Came for the brunch, stayed for the tequila! Definitely recommend the pomegranate tequila sunrise and the scrambled eggs! The tequila/mezcal menu is outrageous in the best way possible. Can't wait for my next trip to Boston so I can visit again Warm, friendly, and lively atmosphere.  Great service.  We had 2 to 3 servers and it was easy to get someone\u2019s attention when needed.  Food was delicious and reasonably priced compared with other Boston restaurants in this area.  Highly recommended. This is a very lively place with delicious food, cocktails, and wine. It gets very busy and the music is loud and sounds like you are in a club. The staff was excellent. Our servers Geronimo and Danielle were outstanding.  They were personable, helpful,  professional, and made great recommendations.  Overall it was a terrific experience and we will definitely return when we are back in Boston. Just tremendous variety on the menu. There were 7 of us and we must\u2019ve sampled 20 different items and all were excellent.  Great drinks and super friendly and attentive service make this a 5 star and a great change of pace downtown. Definitely will be back. I\u2019ve been to Barcelona Wine Bar a few times and have always enjoyed the vibe \u2014 it's got a great atmosphere and has been one of my go-to spots. However, this recent visit was really disappointing, both in terms of service and food.\n\nService was surprisingly lacking. Our waiter only came by once to refill water and didn\u2019t really check in otherwise. It felt like we were mostly left to ourselves, which isn\u2019t what I\u2019ve come to expect here.\n\nWe ordered 7 dishes, and unfortunately, most of them fell short. The *Squid Ink Fideos* was especially bad \u2014 the noodles on top were dry and flavorless, and the dish came with only 4-5 tiny pieces of squid. At $29, it definitely didn\u2019t feel worth it. The *Wagyu Cecina* was another letdown. It didn\u2019t taste like Wagyu at all \u2014 more like flour or filler than beef.\n\nReally hoping this was just an off night, but given the price point and how far the food has slipped, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be back anytime soon. This place seriously never disappoints. We came for dinner on Thursday and came back today for brunch. All I can say is WOW. First of all, the food is outstanding. We got the broccolini benedict, olive oil pancakes, smoked salmon montadito, house made ricotta, and the potato tortilla. We devoured every single dish. Even after we were stuffed, we NEEDED to keep eating because it was just so tasty!! Second of all, the service was top notch. Anything that we needed was tended to immediately, the food took barely any time, and everyone was so kind. Brandon, the manager, made sure to stop by a couple of times just to make sure that we were being cared for. He was so sweet and I could tell that he genuinely wanted to make sure we were having a nice time. Overall, this restaurant is a 10/10. I\u2019ve taken multiple out-of-town friends here and every single one of them agree, it is a Boston must-do. Highly recommended!!  Cosmica is the place to go for Mexican food. Food and service are amazing!!! Alan was in charge of our table. We were a party of 5. He was great, he had the patience to explain and describe to us almost every item in the menu and advise us what dishes were good to share or to order individually. He also recommended drinks. He was an amazing waiter!!! The food is really authentic Mexican! We had guacamole con salsas, Birria, Quesadillas. Carnitas tacos, fajitas de pollo, carne asada. Man, this is the real authenticity Mexican flavor. I highly recommend the birria and the carne asada. And highly recommend the spicy maracuya (passion fruit) margarita, If you are more that 2 drinking Margarita I would recommend getting the margarita pitcher.\nThank you Chef for the great food and thank you Alan for your great service!! Warning! 22% tip-included!\n\nI recommend the Tuna Tostada, Guacamole, and the Carne Asada (which is really just skirt steak). Chicken and enchilada big plates were dry and not very memorable. Ceviche was a bit too salty and the Duck & Pork Carnitas is mostly pork.\n\nLike a more up-scale, Mexican-version of  Barcelona Wine Bar, this restaurant\u2019s interior is even darker and slightly jungly in a fun, chaotic way. The ambience felt ideal for our group of 5 as the place can get pretty loud.\n\nService was solid, but don\u2019t let the waitress fool you. 2 small plates and 1 large plate (as seen on menu) is plenty enough for 2 people. Ended up ordering too much and had to take some home.\n\nAll the food was pretty good for Boston  standards - definitely not authentic but had a slight twist in ingredients to traditional flavors that made the steep price feel slightly more justifiable.\n\nCocktails were quite sweet and not very strong but pairs well with the salty/greasiness of the food. Not bad.\n\nOverall, glad I tried it out, but it\u2019ll probably be a while before I come here again. I enjoyed the C\u00f3smica experience. Good tacos and guacamole. The atmosphere was conducive to talking. Music was on, but not distracting.\n\nService was great.\n\nStreet parking is a challenge. Tacos are amazing! They come with authentic tortillas. Pro tip: You can ask for one taco of each filling instead of the standard order of two tacos with the same filling. I ended up with three different tacos - score!\" This is a lovely hidden gem next to the Revolution Hotel. The food was quite good. I recommend the cauliflower with the pineapple and the sotol ranch water. Alan was our waiter and he was very informative and kind. I also appreciated that the menu was very clear about the gluten free options. Imagine a small neighborhood Cafe this is that. Is quite cozy but very busy.\nEverything here is delicious.\nI especially love the pastrami sandwich. It comes on a bulky roll with mustard, Swiss cheese and grilled onions.\nI generally don't like fries, I love these fries. Men everywhere and everybody has a smile on his face. They all say the food is great. I\u2019ve been here 2 times. As a woman I also think the food is good. The quantity of food Billy served is overwhelming. How can I finish it. I need a big doggie bag. I looked around and all I saw were empty plates and satisfying looks. The steak bomb is huge and is loaded with beef with a bit of grilled veggies and it\u2019s really delicious. You just need a little sprinkle of salt. The fries are big portions. They give you a lot. The breakfast plate is enjoyable too. Roast potatoes with lots of paprika work really well for me. Toasts are pre buttered.  Take a drink from the fridge or order a coffee. The coffee is not too bad although not to be compared with Starbucks.\nThe food is really priced reasonably. Check the most recent menu with price from their website. You can\u2019t find any food that is so affordable at Backbay or anywhere else.\n5 stars for sure. Freshly made breakfast and lunch items. Visited several times for breakfast while I was staying in the Revolution hotel. Can\u2019t beat the prices! Amazing French toast with real (or fake also available) maple syrup! Fantastic bagel and donut selections as well a a variety of muffins. Clean, simple and tasty. Most importantly all are welcome and will feel comfortable here! Best freaking food in town! If you\u2019re visiting Boston, this place is an absolute must. The most delicious food spot ever\u201410/10 would recommend! This place is truly next level\u2014not just for the amazing food but also the incredible service. Chris and the entire Billy\u2019s family go above and beyond to take care of me every single time I visit.\n\nI\u2019ve included a video of their Avgolemono soup below. For those who don\u2019t know, this is a traditional Greek soup that I swear by whenever I\u2019m feeling under the weather. It\u2019s so good, and its healing properties are so strong, I let them know that they can start billing my insurance company directly.\n\nJokes aside, this is hands down my favorite spot in the city. If you\u2019re into cozy breakfast places that make you feel right at home, look no further\u2014Billy\u2019s is the place to go. Im first time here.amazing place . Salesperson is very kind and attentive. Music plays . I ordered capuchino and salmon sandwich, very delicious. I highly recommend.\nCoffe in a big cup feels like at home \ud83d\ude0d Berkeley Perk is a go to breakfast/lunch spot! Great coffee, really good food, and a warm, friendly atmosphere. Definitely recommend coming here! Best coffee I\u2019ve had in Boston! Incredibly rich flavor. Beats Tatte and Blue Bottle hands down! Had the smoked salmon breakfast bagel - pretty good, but not a lot of salmon. Took the kids here they loved it as much as their parents! Fresh, creative breakfast and lunch options and all the coffee choices you can imagine. Great specials: i had \u201cfancy toast\u201d the truffle oil really made this pop! Service by the owners was friendly and attentive. We\u2019ll be back soon! Feels like home. The espresso coffee drinks here are so good. This is hands down the strongest tasting espresso I've had in Boston and anywhere else in the US and for me at least, that's a huge draw. I wish all cafes had the lovely service and strong espresso taste coffee that you get here. You have to go inside the Revolution Hotel to find the coffee shop. There\u2019s usually only one person working there, and it might take them some time to acknowledge your existence. Prices are a little high and surprisingly, they don\u2019t have vanilla as a flavor option. They have counter seating; however, the counters are too high for the stools and it makes it uncomfortable. Plus, they\u2019re too narrow to use a laptop. And this is the only coffee shop I know where the only sweetener they offer is Equal. I prefer Splenda, and hence, will go to one of the many other options in the area. Kohi Coffee has amazing coffee and service! The barista Aziz is always exceptionally friendly and never fails to make me feel welcomed! He recommended the Nola latte and now it\u2019s become my regular go to! He is also really great at latte art which is a definite plus! If you\u2019re looking for a place to have some great coffee and service, I highly recommend coming here! I got the cutie patootie latte which they said to have a lemon note to it. It really just tastes like an oat milk latte with no unique notes to speak of. For the price of 8$ this latte really felt over priced for the quantity, and didn't make up for that with quality. The atmosphere is a 3 just cause it in a nice hotel. Service has much to be desired. I haven't tried the other Kohi location but this one was not a good experience. The options to get good coffee in Back Bay are limited. Kohi easily beats out Greystone, Tatte, and other local spots on quality. It is small though and in a hotel lobby, so not really a place to hang out if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. We ordered a coffee and chai latte at 8:30am. The dude clearly didn\u2019t want to provide any customer service. The chai was completely undrinkable, clotted and burnt. Love the hotel,  but wouldn\u2019t recommend the drinks to anyone. Nero is 0.2 miles down the road. Nice cafe in the South End, a bit expensive but the scones are really nice and a good stop if you\u2019re in the area. The butterscotch scone was full of chips and flavor, fluffy on the inside, and a good size.\n\nCoffee was okay, I prefer the dark roast more than the light. Cafe part gets extremely crowded so be prepared to take it to go or sit outside. A good stop for a quick bite!\n\nOverall not my favorite place in the area but solid! Excellent brunch in the South End! The smoked salmon in the smoked salmon and eggs was amazing. The eggs were pretty good too, but the salmon was really the star. The waiter recommended the guava mimosa which was delicious! Seating is a little crowded but not too squished. It was a rainy day, but the staff were very welcoming. Enjoyed several pastries. Great eats on a less than stellar weather day. My son loved it. Went for dinner and was not disappointed! Food was amazing. We got the Mezze (with all three spreads - the whipped red pepper feta was my favorite), Crispy Calamari & Mussels as well as the Fish&Chips (with truffle fries) to share. We also all got some drinks from the bar which were also tasty. For dessert we did the Affogato with pistachio icecream and that was incredible! The ice-cream itself was super creamy and the cookies it came with were a great bite. Service was fantastic - a little slow but we didn\u2019t mind as we were in no rush. 10/10! I recently had breakfast at the South End Buttery in Boston, and I'd like to share my thoughts for those considering a visit. First and foremost, the venue itself is quite charming, situated in a lovely neighborhood that adds to its appeal. Upon our early morning arrival, we were greeted by a completely empty restaurant. Despite this, and not having a reservation, our request to be seated along the edge of the room was unfortunately not accommodated, and we found ourselves placed right in the center of the empty space downstairs.\n\nAs for the food, I opted for the mushroom omelette. The dish was presented neatly, and while the ingredients were fresh, I found the overall size quite small for the price point. The flavors, though unique, didn't quite harmonize as well as I had hoped, leading to an overall okay but not memorable culinary experience. Also the cheese in my omelette wasn\u2019t melted.\n\nOn the note of value, I felt the pricing was a bit steep relative to the portion sizes and the culinary experience provided.\n\nTo sum up, while the South End Buttery has its charms and the setting is undeniably pleasant, my visit left me feeling that there's room for improvement in terms of seating flexibility, portion sizes, and flavor combinations. It's a decent spot for those in the area who are looking for a quick bite in a nice environment, but manage your expectations regarding the culinary experience and pricing."

    "reviews": "Sydney was extremely helpful. She listened to our needs and offered alternatives. She was never pushy, always helpful. Once home, we heard from her the next day in terms of pricing out our options. She was honest in terms of an expected delivery range. We highly recommend Circle Furniture not only for the excellent products they have, but also because of the excellent service. If all the staff at Circle are as knowledgeable, helpful and considerate as Sydney, we have no hesitation in giving the store a 5 star rating. We worked with Linda Maguire to find fabric chairs for our new diningroom.  See the finished product below, we couldn't be happier! I spent months looking for new tables for our renovated living room.  I found several tables I liked at Circle Furniture.  I worked with three separate associates who all worked together to ensure I was getting the information to make a final decision.  Everyone was patient and helpful.  I was never pressured to order other furniture there even though they knew I was buying several upholstery pieces at a different store.  I was impressed with their professionalism and customer service. We had an amazing experience with Circle Furniture working with James in the Boston location. James was incredibly helpful to me and my husband and worked with us closely as we picked out a couch, a dining room table and chairs that will work perfectly in our new home. James was able to look at the floor plan of our living and dining room and make insightful recommendations on the size of furniture as well as the layout. He understood my taste and design aesthetic perfectly and guided us in a direction we are SO happy with. We can't wait to get out furniture in and see the finished product! I am a designer (new to the area) and Circle Furniture (Linda and James) could not have been friendlier, more responsive or easier to work with when I contacted them for a few client orders.  They carry reputable brands and have been wonderful to work with - especially when trying to get set up in a new area.  I look forward to working with them more in the future! Deli is legit, lots of good options preselected menu items or anything you want custom. Lots of good snack and drink options. Also great options for a last minute gift (wine, crackers, cheese, chocolate) I worked there for 5 years,hard work and dedication. Went above and beyond for this man. I went on Vacation in May of 2024, I came back from vacation and worked a whole shift. During the shift it was the regular as any other day. But at the end of my shift after a vacation from spending money on my kids coming up from Jersey he pulls me in the office and laid me off. There's no trust in this man. Very unprofessional. Communication helps. It was blind sided by me. I would not support this business at all. I recently visited Bacco\u2019s Wine & Cheese with high expectations based on the stellar reviews, but my experience was disappointing, to say the least. The store itself is lovely, offering a well-curated selection of wines and cheeses, but the atmosphere was unexpectedly tense due to the owner\u2019s behavior.\n\nWhile browsing, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the owner speaking to his staff in an unprofessional and rude manner. He was visibly frustrated and, rather than handling it privately or calmly, chose to berate his employees in front of customers. His tone was loud and dismissive, which made the whole experience uncomfortable. I felt terrible for the employees, who seemed embarrassed but continued to work diligently despite the disrespect.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that a lot of effort has gone into the product selection and presentation here, but the owner\u2019s demeanor overshadowed any enjoyment of the visit. I believe that a business can only thrive when there is respect and a positive work environment. Hopefully, the owner reflects on this and considers a more respectful approach to managing his team, as it undoubtedly affects the overall experience for customers. Until then, I\u2019d recommend looking elsewhere if you\u2019re hoping for a friendly, welcoming shopping environment Went in to get a sandwich, told the man behind the counter I'd need a few moments to make my selection. He gave me attitude, and the sandwich wasn't even that good, especiallyfor the price i was charged. Don't trouble yourself.\nThey have other great selections, and other nice staff, but I won't be coming back any time soon. Great selections (a couple very cool liquors you don't see everywhere!) and also super great staff!  They were in super high spirits about the loud and boisterous pride celebration happening outside - felt very welcome as a QTPOC.  Thanks! Sydney was extremely helpful.

This particular boutique carries an in depth variety of the collection. Also the customer service is on point. I suggest to make appointments for a more tailored service and recommend to ask for Asia. I have shopped at this store for over 20 years.  You can never go wrong with the brand of St. John and the people who will assist you!\nSome say much too expensive.  I am wearing stylish pieces I bought over 20 years ago!  Good investment so to speak Great sales team, and beautiful clothing! Great sales and friendly customer service. Awesome service!! If you go here see Cassie!!! So I've visited this store a few times. Today, there was a woman visiting from NYC, named Anny. Anny was phenomenol. Anny was very helpful and knowledgeable. She knew exactly what I needed.  Makes me want to stop at the NYC store next time I'm down there! I love Anne Fontaine. The store has a beautiful display full of timeless French collections. The staff is great. Worth the money. We had the best service! We ended up staying for almost two hours trying on clothes and left with multiple things. Such a beautiful store with amazing employees! We thought this was open on Tuesday! This app says it is... Gorgeous Surprisingly the store was very crowded, so many people. No one pays attention if you need help or assistance. We were waiting for 30 min and no one approached us. We started browsing and went on the second floor. We saw an employee who was finishing up with her client and asked if she could help us. She was amazing, very helpful and I want to recognize her. ( I will post her pic) She spent about 20 min with us explaining about scarf holders. We ended up not buying it because we could not figure out the use of it. I guess it's good to come on weekdays with the appointment. Otherwise the store is clean, beautiful and very well organized. I always have the most wonderful experience at Herm\u00e8s , thanks to Lin. In the past, I didn\u2019t have the best experiences, and it kept me from shopping here. But Lin completely changed that. Her attention to detail, professionalism, and kindness make every visit a pleasure. She\u2019s truly amazing! If you\u2019re visiting, make sure to ask for Lin \u2014 you\u2019ll be in the best hands! Nice and helpful staff. There a line when we got there but the wait time was very short. One of the Hermes locations I\u2019ve been to. My husband and I were visiting from out of state and wanted to pay a visit to this Hermes location. We did book an appointment prior to arriving in Boston for a Monday but we since we had time on Saturday, we decided to stop by earlier. We did have to wait in line for a little bit for the next available SA but this made sense since we did not have an appointment. While we waited, we spoke to the gentleman at the door and he was very friendly and accommodating.\n\nI am very grateful that we had done this because that is how we met our SA, Zachary. There is not enough words to express our gratitude on the service he had provided to us during our first visit. He listened to what we were looking for and went above and beyond to show us different styles and colors for the items we were interested in. He certainly had an amazing eye and knowledge of the brand. He made us feel very comfortable and in turn, we wanted to make sure that our appointment on Monday was with him.\n\nFor the day of our actual appointment, it was relatively quiet in the store which we liked and it gave us time to browse through the store while waiting for our appointment with Zachary. During this time, each staff member was very welcoming and they made an effort to ask if we were being helped, including the manager - which we appreciated.\n\nThis is one of the very first appointments my husband and I had where we truly enjoyed the experience thanks to Zachary. He took time again to make sure we saw different options for the items we were taking a look at such as the blankets and we appreciate his fashion taste and advice when we were unsure on which item to go with. His honesty, effort, and overall happy aura is what made us smile leaving the store. We definitely would recommend him for anyone stopping by the store and he is someone we will continuously visit when there is an opportunity to come back to Boston. Upon accompanying a friend to this wretched establishment I experienced the rudest  customer service ever.\nSelf important\nUnintelligent\nIncompetent\nEmbarrassing\nTruly the worst, absolute worst\nEach of them striving to get the Whale clients\nTreat everyone else like dirt.\nTime to fire this crew of idiots.\nNot a shred of humanity amongst them save the fine gentleman who was working the door I recently visited the Audemars Piguet boutique in Boston to drop off my watch for service and had an amazing experience. Christopher, the sales associate, was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. He explained the service process clearly and addressed all my concerns. Plus, he shared fascinating insights about the brand, which I really appreciated.\n\nChristopher is also assisting me in finding another watch in the meantime, showing true dedication to customer service. If you're in Boston, I highly recommend visiting and working with Christopher. He made my experience truly exceptional! Made a trip to Boston just to look at watches. Stoped in at AP and had a great chat with Patrick about the brand, collecting, and watches in general.  No snobbery what so ever, just a fun chat with a true collector.  Also got to try on a very special RO.   Thanks for the fun and memorable experience. \u201cI had a fantastic visit to this Boutique on Monday, February 24, during a short trip to Boston. The staff were warm, welcoming, and went above and beyond to make me feel at ease. I spent nearly an hour with Christopher, a standout Sales Associate, who patiently walked me through the brand\u2019s history and stunning collections. His expertise and enthusiasm made the experience unforgettable. Highly recommend booking an appointment\u2014you won\u2019t be disappointed!\u201d Went in today and had an amazing experience. Spoke with Nicole and she is a wonderful person. She let me try on different models of Royal Oaks and was very insightful in the process of attaining my holy grail watch. Looking forward to the day where I can attain one of these gorgeous timepieces. A+ customer service. Definitely recommend stopping by and checking out the boutique. Thank you Nicole Christopher has been amazing to work with! Stopped in a few weeks back to gain information about the pieces and the brand. He was so knowledgeable, caring, and personable! You can tell he really enjoys his line of work and did not mind one bit to sit, talk, and show me the pieces they had. Hoping we can secure one of my desired ones in the near future !\n\nThanks again! Jojo is the best! Always patient and recommending the right thing for you. I don't usually leave reviews but in this case I felt like it was necessary and well deserved as Katie, the assistant manager who helped us, was very knowledgeable of the brand and its history. She remembered the previous seasons' colors for the past decade off the top of her head, was friendly and provided fair and detailed advice. Not only did she make the shopping experience a breeze but she also aided us in our tour of Boston by recommending local attractions. She even offered us another set of water bottles before leaving the store to keep us hydrated for the rest of our journey around Boston. This is how luxury shopping should always be. Thank you Katie! Best Bottega Veneta store I\u2019ve ever been to! Katie was super sweet and help us with everything. Items are widely available and if not they can order it for you overnight. Everyone here is super nice and friendly. Stop by check out gifts, bags, clothes, accessories, and more because the service and the experience you get is outstanding. (not this locations fault) I am just so disappointed in the quality of my bag and how this company has dealt with it. Not how a \"luxury\" store should operate or make their bags. My bag looks completely destroyed from 2 months of wear... And they don't care or are willing to do anything about it- essentially blaming it on me. For wearing it? Seriously rethink before you purchase Bottega- invest in so many other beautiful bags out there. Ill never be buying another bag from there again. One of the most wonderful shopping experiences I can remember. Blair was fantastic. Beautiful leather goods and ready-to-wear items. Very family-oriented practice in the city! Dr. Jost was personable and down to earth. The entire clinic staff was warm and welcoming, and especially accommodating of my wife and I bringing our 4 month old along with us. Highly recommend this clinic! Back Bay Eye Care is the best eye clinic I\u2019ve ever been to! I used to have various vision problems, and Dr. Jost always handled them perfectly. He is incredibly patient and professional, making every visit reassuring. The staff is also very friendly and welcoming, which makes the whole experience even better. Highly recommend! Hands down the best optometrist I\u2019ve ever visited! As an eye care professional myself, I\u2019m highly discerning when choosing offices, and Dr. Zachary Jost exceeded my expectations. Not only is he a consummate professional - proactive, meticulous, and detail-oriented - but he\u2019s also a kind and approachable human being. He took the time to engage in thoughtful discourse, making the entire experience both pleasant and informative. Not to mention the front desk was also extremely competent and welcoming! I highly recommend Back Bay Eye Care to anyone seeking an elevated, informative, and personal eye care experience. Dr. Jost was very kind and efficient, and so were the other staff members that worked with me (I didn't catch their names). Everything regarding cost and insurance was explained to me upfront. Dr. Jost made sure that I understood what she was testing and why, as well as the outcomes. Highly recommend Back Bay Eye Care! Phenomenal experience. Dr. Jost gave a thorough exam and he took extra time to walk me through what he was seeing and explained everything in such detail. He is very kind and approachable. Highly recommend! Very pretty!! Nice local area to walk.  Still see a variety of wild birds.  Water is off-limits due to a bacterial bloom right now (Summer 2020).  [It's been a great year] Beautiful park which includes a\nMuseum along the Charles River.\nMoody st Dam has a fish ladder & falls. Quiet and lovely views, place to gather and chat. Great space to relax. Friendly, welcoming staff. Sadly the store lack products. There is next to no product, even worse no variety with the little lingerie they do stock. Very disappointing. Staff was knowledgeable of the product, worked to get the fit and look just right. Took exceptional care of this customer lack of customer service skills As many other reviewers said, he is charming and kind, but I really feel I was cheated, I bought bearings and they were 80 dollars, online they come at 22; and then the spacers he charged me 45 dollars and on-line I saw them at around 20. He is a dear and found me the spacers in another shop and went to fetch them, but really, it overprices a lot. Also, the bearings are recommended for skate boards, and I am a roller hockey player, not sure if I will resell them or use them \ud83e\udd7a I really wanted to like him because he is such a fun guy, but sorry, it was not wise of me not to check the prices before. Such a great experience - Chris brought my incredibly rusty back to life!  Rides better than when I first bought it \u2014 he upgraded my bearings and gave me a few lessons on how to take care of my board (i.e., don\u2019t ride it through snow / road salt).  I would highly recommend.  I hope I don\u2019t need to stop by for repairs anytime soon, but I may need to stop by and say hello when I\u2019m in the area.  Thank you again Chris! The owner, chris, was extremely kind and helpful. I came in looking for a skateboard as a beginner and he helped find the right fit for me. He even taught me the basics of skateboarding; took me right outside the shop and gave me a lesson for about 20 minutes, it was fantastic! I\u2019d highly recommend this skate shop! Oh also I\u2019ll attach a photo of my board! Chris was wonderful - everyone who works there was pretty great. I'm a beginner skater, so they all helped me out with picking a board (which I'm absolutely obsessed with), and Chris even took me out & helped me learn how to ride it! Lots of personalized help and a truly energetic spirit for finding your best fit. Excited to hopefully be back here a lot as I get into the sport - best little joint in Boston. :-) If you\u2019re looking for Outdoor wheels, this is the place. The owner, Chris is very knowledgeable about skates(Recommend RollerSkates), and he gives off a respectable business with great attitude. Highly recommend checking out if you need replacements for wheels, stoppers, or even just new skates. I've stayed here two or three times visiting a sibling who attends MIT and have always found McCormick a cozy, clean, and inviting place! The staff were so friendly and accommodating and were always having casual conversations with the students. It's clear they really took the time to get to know the people they took care of and become friends with them. The rooms were nice, and the views were incredible. I also loved how there was a kitchen on every floor that had an oven as well as a stove top, sink, refrigerator, and freezer. quality country kitchen. literally only thing i go to in mccormick. i guess there's a dining hall too, but the country kitchen is just super convenient This place was super cool but I think I made the wrong choices when it comes to picking what I wanted!\n\nI got the famous Boston Cream Pie (wasn\u2019t a fan at all, I don\u2019t like milk chocolate so that one is on me). The cake and the cream were really good aside from chocolate.\n\nI got that little strawberry because it looked cute, I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say it tasted like medicine! It was super strong in flavor and not a good one.\n\nI walked by the place twice and saw really long lines both days, without having any background about what it is. I simply just wanted to try it but it wasn\u2019t what I was looking for.\n\nThere is waiting for sure if you wanna buy something, but the line goes by so fast because they got a couple employees working. This is a CASH only spot, I had to go to an ATM across the street to get some cash.\n\nI still recommend trying this place out, maybe choose better options and leave a better review:) Mike\u2019s Pastry in Boston is a must-visit bakery, especially if you love indulgent treats. I tried the Boston cr\u00e8me pie donut and the raspberry swirl donut, and both were fantastic. The Boston cr\u00e8me pie donut was perfectly moist with a rich, creamy filling and a smooth chocolate glaze on top. The raspberry swirl donut had a delightful balance of sweet and tart flavors with a tender, fresh dough. The pastries are homemade and consistently delicious, making the wait in line worthwhile. The staff were efficient and friendly, even during busy times. Just a heads-up: Mike\u2019s is cash-only, so be prepared. Overall, a top-notch bakery experience that I highly recommend for anyone visiting Boston\u2019s North End.  Parking is difficult - $5 for most items. Extremely long  lines but move quickly. Decadent cannolies that are a bit pricey, but worth it to try. We stopped while doing the freedom trail. It was a Tuesday night so the line wasn't too long. Had the original, pistachio, and amaretto. The ameretto was amazing with the chocolate coating. Would recommend the place for a treat. Maybe don't go here everyday or you may get harpooned in the harbor... Bakery store for to go, as no seating area. Staff are friendly and service is fast. They have many options including cakes. We only tried cannoli with ricotta cheese, that tastes very good. Assuming other products tastes very good as well! Prices are a little on high end. They only take cash. Tried 2 cannolis and a slice of their Boston Cr\u00e8me pie. The cannolis were over the top good. Flavor, texture and structure were awesome. Still want more after it\u2019s gone good. Too bad it\u2019s cash only. Limited my sample size. :( Grill 23 & Bar is an okay restaurant, but the food doesn\u2019t quite justify the high prices. While I have to give credit where it's due\u2014the steak was cooked to perfection\u2014the sides fell short. The macaroni was uninspired, just buttered noodles with cheese and a sprinkle of Parmesan, lacking depth or creativity. The spinach could have used a bit of heat to balance the acidity, and the grilled onions felt unnecessary.\n\nAs for the shrimp, it was an interesting experience. Growing up on an island, I\u2019m used to shrimp with a firm, fleshy texture. In the U.S., I only find that at high-end restaurants, while most places serve shrimp that\u2019s disappointingly gelatinous and unnatural.\n\nAnd then there was the coconut cake\u2014a true letdown. The cake layers were barely half an inch thick, overwhelmed by an excess of sugary coconut shavings. The filling also had shavings, and the coconut sauce was so sweet that it only resembled coconut when I paired it with my shrimp. Otherwise, it just tasted like caramel. A better approach would be a more refined balance\u2014perhaps a passion fruit filling or even incorporating rum into the cake layers for depth and contrast.\n\nOverall, Grill 23 & Bar has potential, but for the price, I expected a more refined and balanced dining experience. The food at Grill 23 is undeniably good, but the experience didn\u2019t live up to the expectations for a restaurant of this caliber and price point. Out of the six steaks we ordered, two had issues\u2014one arrived cold, and the other was very underdone when we specifically requested medium. For a steakhouse of this reputation, it was disappointing to see such inconsistencies.\n\nThe service was another letdown. Our server brought drinks we didn\u2019t order, and the overall attentiveness and professionalism were just not there. It felt like a standard dining experience rather than the elevated one you would expect from a high-end establishment.\n\nFor the price, I was hoping for a more seamless and exceptional experience. Excellent steaks and food in an upscale atmosphere. Everything was delicious and well prepared. This is a very expensive restaurant but has more reasonable dishes along with the pricey unique offerings. They have private rooms for groups as well as open space for normal dinners however the main room can get loud even on a weeknight when busy. This is a great place for a special night out or a business dinner. Have wanted to experience Grille 23 for decades!! Sadly, never made it until now!!! After reading reviews, I decided to sit at the lounge on the 2nd floor. I will say, I went solo, and my experience is as a single. I guess I was fortunate because I went early without a reservation (at the bar). And was able to get a seat between a pretty full bar.\nI Ordered a Cosmopolitan. It was covered with ice crystals. Outside the glass and inside the drink!! Amazingly beautiful and delicious. I ordered the tuna tartar. The presentation was impressive and it was excellent. I received a bread basket with a variety of delicious breads along with salted butter.\nFor dinner, I chose the ribeye, medium rare. The seasonings were spot on. My side was the carrots. They were smokey and sweet. Absolutely delicious. I never order dessert but decided on the coconut cake since it is their signature dessert. It was fabulous!!!\nService was great. It did get extremely loud as more people filled the space. Food=excellent. Service=excellent. Atmosphere=loud Celebrated my birthday dinner here last night. Gorgeous ambience. Fresh flowers on display around every corner. We sat in the upstairs lounge. It is decorated to give you a feel of being in someone\u2019s home for a holiday dinner. So delightful. Martini was ice cold and well crafted. 1,000 layer potato is a must try. The sauce and caviar on top made each bite an experience. My husband and I agreed that our filets were the most excellent we\u2019ve had in a long time. They were cooked to perfection and the seasoning on it is something else! Mac n cheese was Cavatappi and so good. Thumbelina carrots were sweet from the maple glaze and had sesame seeds for a nice crunch I didn\u2019t know I needed! The grill 23 tots are a must for a side. Fried bites of soft mashed potato. Pairs so well with any cut of steak. I wish I had room for dessert but they were so so kind and still brought me a scoop of ice cream with a candle! Thank you to the team who made my night memorable I\u2019ll be speaking about this marvelous dinner until I return Grill 23 & Bar is an okay restaurant, but the food doesn\u2019t quite justify the high prices.

Thank you to the team who made my night memorable I\u2019ll be speaking about this marvelous dinner until I return Excellent experience from start to finish. 5pm reservation, was immediately seated. Started with oysters on the half shell and two cocktail #32's. We enjoyed the blue fin tuna, the native monk fish, and split a bowl of carrots. The perfect amount of food for two people without stuffing ourselves. Everything was fresh and prepared to perfection. Service was attentive and felt like we were at a friend's house. For dessert we split the almond cake. Everything made from scratch, you cannot have a bad meal here. A true culinary experience and we will not hesitate to make another reservation when back in the area. Very great dinner for my boyfriend and I. Attentive and professional service by Emily , classy atmosphere and fantastic food. We tried both the New England and RI chowder and it was delicious. Warm and filling, we prefer the New England. We got the Rockefeller from reviews and didn\u2019t realize it was baked, very good but will just stick to the Raw Bar when we come back. If you like baked oysters I definitely recommend. Absolutely loved their Sixpenny oysters. Will be back. The food here was perfect. Raw bar was excellent. Roasted oysters were super flavorful. Would highly recommend the tuna entree.\n\nService was fine - a little slow at times, but nothing too excessive. Overall, a really good experience. Had a great birthday dinner at Treehouse. The waitress was so kind and explained everything in detail. She really made sure I enjoyed my birthday! I loved the squash curry soup and the oysters of course. The drinks were divine and the area was very cute. Super close walk to parking area and other restaurants/bakeries/ shops. Loved it here, can\u2019t wait to return for another oyster flight! A friend recommended this place and made the reservation for us and had them put us in the \u201cTreehous,\u201d which is upstairs in a couple levels of decks outside.  It was cold so the eating areas were enclosed and nicely heated with just a little cold air getting in.   It was actually a cool spot and we enjoyed it.\nI started with the New England Chowder which was good, if thin.  I\u2019ve had better but this wasn\u2019t bad just not my favorite.  The daily baked oyster crackers were good but an additional cost and I would have preferred the packaged.  I like the effort though.  They were softer than a regular oyster cracker and larger.\nThe Bucatini in lobster stock sauce was excellent though.  The taste of the lobster in the sauce was sublime and the breadcrumbs added a nice crunchiness.  I really enjoyed it\nMy wife got the cornbread with apple butter and liked it a lot.  It was a very generous portion and we took some home it was so good.  I tried it and liked it as well.\nShe had the Tagliatelle with house made ragu of beef.  That was also really good, seemed like a traditional ragu to me which I appreciated.  I had a decent amount of this too as my wife was full at this point.\nThe menu is not large but there are some other dishes I\u2019d like to try like the empanadas and the mussels.  Maybe next time. Came for brunch on a Sunday.\nPlace was nice albeit a little dirty under all tables (only 1 patron when we came in to eat).\nThe blueberry lemon pancakes were a little overcooked on one side and dry. My son didn't care for them. They actually tasted better the day after when I heated them up. Berries on top were refreshing, but most of the blueberries had stems on them.\nThe lobster Benedict was great! Lobster was a big fail as it was VERY VERY DRY. Never had I had lobster this dry and just hardened. Also my egg was extremely overcooked inside. I did not eat the potatoes.\nThe burger was delicious. Nela and Paula were the sweetest people i\u2019ve ever met in the restaurant business. I had a lovely time chatting with them and they were nothing but kind to me. They made sure I was well taken care of and made me feel like a person and not just a customer- which is hard to find nowadays. I will be recommending this place to all my friends & family! Amazing food- cooked just right, tasty drinks, and perfect attention to detail with everything from decor to ambiance. Everyone should come check this place out for themselves! I ate here three times during my stay, and everything my table ordered was delicious.\nLovely presentation. Very friendly and attentive waitstaff. Dark and moody vibe. Quiet. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc We went for Valentine\u2019s Day. Wasn\u2019t busy at all. Lots of reservations available. Drinks were light and delicious. Our app, the crab cake was 10/10 and honestly the best crab cake we\u2019ve ever had. Our entr\u00e9es were cooked to perfection, flavorful and filling. Dessert was the best. The tiramisu was very good, not too sweet but perfectly paired with the espresso. Would recommend and we will be visiting again! \ud83d\ude04 service was 8/10. Food was very expensive, 30 dollars for homefries,eggs, pancake and sandwich.  Atmosphere was good in a few areas felt very colonial but felt steampunk did not compliment it. Came back a second time after our first visit was absolutely amazing. The place is nicely decorated, clean and their Staff is super friendly so if you plan on eating there, be ready for feeling like you walked into a Greek family home. We ordered the chicken and beef pitas with a few sides/dessert and both times it came out quick, tasted delicious, and we were absolutely stuffed. We\u2019ll definitely come back! As a vegetarian and world traveler, I was so lucky to find Cafe Med in Boston. Cafe Med not only has a wide variety of vegetarian options, they use authentic Greek and Middle Eastern recipes!\n\nI usually order the Spinach Pie and Greek Salad, along with a veggie rollup. Did I mention  that you can stray from the menu and build your own sandwiches and salads? Well you can!\n\nCafe Med also has a great ambiance with soothing Greek music playing over the sound system and Eclectic decor.\n\nCafe Med is also a block away from the MBTA's Arlington station on Green line, so its convenient for me to have lunch there during the week.\n\nEvery time I leave Cafe Med I feel satisfied and refreshed! The chicken rice plate it very good. Bukhlawa dessert is very tasty and fresh in the lunch hours. The red and white sauces add good taste to the food. They end up finishing the food very early in the afternoons that you've to wait for rice or chicken to be cooked. That is the only downside of this place. Sometimes during lunch, some musician plays Persian music with their traditional instrument. Long lines during lunch hours. Prices are decent. Ordered a vegetarian gyro with falafel and got a chicken one instead. I understand it gets busy during lunch but getting your order right isn't asking for much. Also saw an employee with a beard preparing food with no hairnet... gross. Never going back here again. Ordered a spinach pie - it was so so... Not hot, not big either.  Person putting it in a to go container asked if I wanted salad with it.  I asked if it came with it and she said yes, so I said sure, I'll have some salad with it... Then she rings me up and charges extra for salad!!  Grrrr... At least I tried it, now I know not to go back! I just popped in cause it was open and happy I gave it a shot. The food was made on the spot I don\u2019t think I waited longer than 4 minutes for each plate. The shrimp shumai was so fresh and not fried or too breaded. The lunch sushi deal came with soup and 2 rolls for $11! Also fried the avocado salad which was njce and light. 5/5 and the workers were all pleasant and happy to serve. Will definitely visit once I\u2019m back in Boston Friendly, polite service and great food, quickly prepared. I've had the scallion pancakes (comes with a soy sauce type of sauce), spring rolls (comes with a kind of sweet and sour sauce), and the avocado smoothie. I'd definitely recommended all of them.\n\nThe scallion pancakes are fried to a crisp on the outermost layer but otherwise chewy. The spring rolls are savory and moist with a crispy shell. The avocado smoothie is perfectly creamy and sweet but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nIt hasn't been busy at all when I visited around dinnertime, and it's always clean and neat in the restaurant. The ingredients are very fresh, the mango sushi tastes so good and is unforgettable. The street view is very beautiful at night! Nice clean restaurant where you can place your order for takeout online for an easy pickup and beat the lunch rush. I almost always get the Chicken Katsu when I go here for lunch - it always hits the spot. Food is very high quality and you can see the cooks making it behind the cashier. Small and simple Japanese restaurant that is family owned and managed.  Service is excellent: friendly, fast, and accurate.  I live nearby and order from this place all the time.  My takeout orders are always ready when I arrive.  Prices are low - well below any fancy sushi restaurant.  Excellent sushi and low prices - what more could you want? What a treat to dine at Mooncusser!  It's a 7 course prix fixe so come hungry.  They portions are not small.  Beautifully presented and so well executed!  It was a long dinner so keep that in mind.  Two desserts at the end is a bit extra but you're already indulging!  And Moon Bar downstairs so much better than it used to be.  Nicely decorated and the cocktail program is so great!  My only complaint is the bathroom.  They should really make the walk downstairs to the bathroom nicer.  It ruins the whole dining experience.  This restaurant is definitely pricey but special and worth every penny! Went to celebrate my partners birthday. Everything was lovely! Food was great, drinks were yummy and balanced. Would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or celebration. We are big fans of Chef Carl Dooley, a very talented and creative chef! We very much appreciate his efforts in regularly coming up with new seasonal menus. There are very few restaurants in Boston that does what this chef strives to do and he does it well consistently.\n\nOur favorites from the current tasting are the crab curry, crudo, both the cod and hake main courses as well as the almond and pear cake dessert. The courses were fairly light, except for the gnocchi, but one never leaves hungry. His four courses are really more like six since the first course consists of three dishes that are quite substantial in portion size.\n\nService is always friendly and efficient. We like the white table cloth, which many restaurants have done away with. It feels more like a special dining experience and pairs well with the chef's refined food. Our only minor complaint is that it can get quite noisy at times.\n\nWe look forward to his next new menu! With great reputation comes great expectation. Yet I was underwhelmed with what I tasted at this haute cuisine legend. Dishes were pretty on the eye but conservative on the palate. Nothing pushed the imagination with creative twists and bold flavors. It was all safe and conventional, which I expect from lower ranked and lower priced. But not here in the lofty heights of Boston\u2019s culinary elite. Unfortunately it only soars in elevation perched on the top floor of the mini Flatiron building where it resides. I don't usually eat at these types of places so I don't have anything to compare to in terms of \"is it worth it\". The dishes were very interesting to eat and I had never tasted such combinations before, yet they were flavorful and skillfully cooked (example: the fish was cooked just right with crispy skin and flaky meat). My friend and I tried every thing on the menu and the only dishes I would go out of my way to order again are the crab causa, roasted dorade, and the ricotta kiwi dessert, but it was an experience I've never gotten anywhere else (from the few fine dining spots I've been to elsewhere). Maybe the novelty is what you pay for?\n\nThe service was great. Maybe we were just slow eaters but we would finish each course and within a few minutes they would collect our plates and within a reasonable time serve the next course. While on a trip to Boston had to try this popular Restaurant. As you walk in your greeted warmly.  The menu is a Turkish style so most things are meant to be shared.  The salads are very large and filling and any of the special side table presentations are very enjoyable and well worth the show.  I was very happy with the service the food. Nusr-Et Boston has extraordinary interiors, high ceilings, unique restrooms with pheasants on glass panelled doors.  However, I found the menu prices high and the service to be middling.  There is a mandatory gratuity of 18%, regardless of the size of the party.  Within earshot, a server said to another employee that 18% is for average service, after picking up my final credit card receipt that showed I didn't add any additional tip.\n\nI had the Nusr-Et Salad which was appropriately-sized for the $25 charge.  The salad is flavorful and has a good crunch with the pomegranate seeds and nuts.  The menu picture shows the salad as piled high and with large cubes of cheese.  The salad I got didn't have much cheese and looked simpler than the menu photo. The cheeseburger was basic-tasting.  The bathroom is spectacular.  This visit was probably a one-time occasion for me. I enjoyed my visit to this place! The shashlik had an unpleasant odor, but the other steak paired with mashed potatoes was absolutely delightful. Overall, a tasty experience! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f I ordered a Nusr-Et burger for the main course, and baklava and tea for dessert. The quality of the burger was good (7 out of 10 ). Baklava was Perfect !!!! However the money you will be paying is not worth the experience you are going to get. Recommend this place for once or twice a year only. Went out for my friends birthday as a big group. The hostess and waiter/waitress were very accommodating to our party and treated us with a lot of class. Jan, our waiter, was phenomenal and went above and beyond. Drink-wise, this restaurant did superb in presenting the drinks, I got a smoked old fashioned, thus, the drink coming in a treasure chest with smoke all in it did the job. Taste wise, the bartenders out together quality drinks. Now let\u2019s get to the food. Presentation wise, our meals came out in a nice and timely manner, starting off with appetisers. I tried this smashed up rather finely filet mignon ground beef wrap with vinegar and what seemed to be honey mustard on top after they finished preparing it. It contained, crunched up chips, dry cheese and arugula in the inside. Taste was rather different, bearable to eat and but not our cup of tea. The best app was probable the wagyu sushi rolls and the mediterranean salad (for those that like crunch and sweetness in their salads). The wagyu sushi rolls came out nice and warm and tasted just as tender as you\u2019d expect. Finally we got the tomahawks, which again, Salt Bae presentation wise, it was nicely done. Taste wise it was good, tender in the middle, and the salt did its job in giving its flavour. But in all honesty, Steak tasted like a steak from Del Friscos, not worth the price they advertise for. I expected matriculated flavours if we were going to spend racks on a birthday dinner there. Mashed potato was a little bland and the cooked spinach was too moist with no flavour. Thus, a decent experience for Salt Bae. Tasty and amazing restaurant! Didn't take as much photos since I just wanted to enjoy the meal and wasn't planning to write a review. But this place blew me. Everything was delicious and there was so much attention to detail, from chef and staff.\nWould highly recommend the Salt Crust Branzino and Paella.\nDefinitely want to bring my family to dine here next time! This is the kind of place you want to give 6 stars! Impeccable service, beautiful and delicious food, with great drinks and extensive wine list. The atmosphere is perfectly curated. Everything here is thoughtful and well done. We only had two nights in town and I am thankful I have them one of the evenings! This guys deserve 5 stars! Food, hospitality was amazing 10/10. Our server Chris was really amazing and took care all the time about my mushroom allergy! I never had an amazing care like that! Best gnochetti with lobster and the best Ribye that I never had! I\u2019m a Chef and really \u201cpic\u201d so I can tell\u2026.. I\u2019ll come back for sure! Tks so much \u201cOstra Restaurant Boston\u201d This place has beautiful decor and the food was fantastic! The service could use some improvement tho.\n\nThe service felt very rushed and the staff the cleaned our table so very fast we thought they were going to drop plates and food on us. We were also disappointed to find out the kitchen closed at 9pm on Thursday evening (\u201cFriday Junior\u201d) even though we waited 20 minutes to even get any kind of service. Ordered the lobster gnochetti from the appetizer menu and they were able to make it a dinner sized portion. It was great. The bread is tasty too This is my all time favourite restaurant. I discovered it as a student coming from overseas and since then I am bringing all my loved ones here. This time I came with my boyfriend for my birthday and he agreed saying it\u2019s the best dinner he ever had. We started with the meatballs appetizer, which was absolutely phenomenal. For dinner we both got the filet mignon cooked perfectly for the medium rare temperature, the mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious. By this time we were already full but being my birthday I wanted some chocolate cake as well, which didn\u2019t disappoint me. All and all I love this place, the atmosphere gives you an image of the past, Sinatra is always playing as a background music. The restaurant is clean and the service was on point, genuine and nice people. Love love love! We wanted to grab a bite to eat after a show but we only have about an hour and a half left of parking. We decided to try Maggiano's Little Italy because it was close to the parking garage and looks very clean. We got seated right away and the hostess was very nice when my husband requested a booth. Thomas was our waiter and he was very polite and answered all of our questions.  My hubby ordered the Shrimp Scampi and I ordered Chicken Marsala. Joe really enjoyed his meal and said he could tell each layer of his meal was cooked separately and then put together. Everything wasn't sure thrown in the same pan. Each had its own flavor. I on the other hand am what you would call a snob when it comes to Chicken Marsala. I have never found a restaurant that has cooked chx Marsala as good as I until today. Finally! A restaurant that knows what they are doing. Thank you for the great food and the quick service. We came here around 7.45pm on a Monday evening and had a lovely meal.\nThe staff were super friendly & the place was really nicely decorated for Christmas.\nWe ordered an old fashioned and an ice tea both were good.\nThe food was delicious and plentiful so come hungry!\nThe crab cakes my husband said were really tasty. The pasta dish had such a lovely sauce and could definitely feed two! The fish was really nice and light if you wanted a lighter option.\nWe couldn\u2019t fit dessert in but we saw some others and they also looked nice.\nWould highly recommend and the staff again were lovely & friendly. We have eaten at Maggiano's about 4 times. The food is always excellent in our experience. Once a table near us was not happy and I could hear the waiter offer many solutions for them. Our waiter on Saturday, April 12th was Patrick. Patrick was very attentive and pleasant. Patrick inquired if we were celebrating anything. Since we were celebrating a birthday he brought out a dessert (that we ordered) with a candle and coordinated the singing of Happy Birthday. Patrick also offered early on that if anything was not to our liking to let him know and he would make it right. It was a lovely experience. The atmosphere was comfortable. We all enjoyed our meals and desserts. The place has lively and warm ambiance. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, making the dining experience even more enjoyable. We ordered Famous Rigatoni \u201cD\u201d and it was some of the best I\u2019ve had\u2014rich, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The portion size is also great and more than enough for two people to share. The bruschetta was good, though I\u2019ve had it better on previous visits. Overall, a fantastic spot for Italian comfort food with great service. My cousin went to this school. Every time I hanged out with her she always saying how the staffs are weird and rude to students. And how they talk over them while trying to explain a situation that happened to them. (It was a serious situation). She was very uncomfortable talking to staff and having a private conversation. She also mentioned how students vape and smoke in the bathrooms and how there are fights every day. She also told me that she got bullied by these group of girls. Mainly three girls who bullied her. She wasn't able to talk to any staff because the staff would not let her talk and would just speak over her. quite an interesting school, stayed for 1 year, went to an exam school, some bad teachers, independent study was nice! very average, but good school for learning! I feared that one teacher when I was a 6th grader. Or maybe two, or more... I failed some of my projects when I don't understand them D: So yea. And I'm giving it a one star because yes and don't ask.\n\nAlso, there's some really terrible staff. I trust there's still good ones. If you ever heard of the news that happened about a teacher being arrested for the yk, that's what I mean There was this one teacher I had that would just yell at student EVEN if they weren't talking and she'd barely teach because she was yelling at everyone so much. So yea, one star, but the 6th grade math teacher is S tier. It\u2019s not a good school wouldn\u2019t recommend your kids going Invictus is a legendary name in the world of CrossFit, especially in 2023 when Team Invictus took the top spot at the CrossFit Games. They have a couple of locations in Boston, and even though I used to live and work in the area, I never had the opportunity to drop-in with them.\n\nI recently got back into CrossFit this past May after many years away and have been working at going 3x a week. Well, I was going to be back in Boston for a couple of days, and if I wanted to be consistent, I needed to find a gym. Invictus in Park Square was within a 15 minute walk from my hotel (Omni Parker House).\n\nI took in a 7am class. I got there about 15 minutes and the previous class was still in action, so I got a preview of what I was in for as far as the programming. Coach Molly caught sight of me and told me there was another room I could warm up and stretch in while I waited for my class to start.\n\nWhen it was time to start and I went to see the space in full for the first time, it was a little smaller than I was expecting. being long and narrow and relatively shorter ceilings where I wouldn't feel comfortable doing jerks or snatches, but apart from the heigh they make really good use of the space. It was a full class, but no one was in anyone else's way.\n\nCoach Molly was welcoming throughout. She gave clear instruction to the class. Even though she didn't know a whole lot about my time with CF (apart from the fact that I go to a gym in NH and have been going since May), she made sure to let me know where I can find equipment or personal dry erase boards, and she had a keen eye in how she observed my form and gave good feedback. That's important to me, because the last thing I want is to do something wrong and get hurt because of it. The strength programming just so happened to involve a movement I haven't had the opportunity to do yet at my home gym (sumo deadlifts), and between Molly's instruction and her advice on a minor adjustment, I felt completely at ease with the movement.\n\nThe programming for the metcon was a beast, in my eyes. In the best way. Sometimes, I like to feel like a workout has kicked my butt, particularly if I go in the morning (I'm ordinarily a lunchtime or after work guy). This didn't disappoint. Lots of power cleans, lots of wall balls, lots of rowing.\n\nThe other athletes that were there were pretty cool. I tend to keep to myself when I'm in an unfamiliar place, but CrossFit gyms can feel familiar because everyone is sharing a similar mindset. I was cranking out the last of my rowing calories and some of the other athletes that were there\u2014people who don't know me, and in all likelihood will never even see me again\u2014rallied around me to push me to finish the rowing. That's the kind of stuff I love about CF, and it's good to see a big name in the industry still has that sense of community.\n\ntl;dr - Although smaller than the average gym, they make great use of the space. Coach Molly was a great all-around instructor, the programming was challenging in a good way, and the other athletes share that sense of community that CrossFit is known for. I have been a member of this gym for about 5 years now and I love it. The quality of the coaching is excellent. The coaches take you through a warm up before each class, and they demonstrate each movement beforehand. They also coach you if they see you are doing a movement incorrectly. I would usually rather sit on the couch than work out, but once I am there, it is actually fun! Fun people and nice coaches. I believe my fitness has improved quite a bit. If you are feeling intimidated by CrossFit, don't worry, you can \"scale\" the exercises in any workout to your current abilities. Some of the best coaches and programming I have ever seen at a gym. People who really care about fitness, and the people they serve. Highly recommended. (been going for over a year) I just read a negative review of the athletes and coaches. I will say that while yes, this gym has some of the  top athletes in CrossFit, they are also some of the most friendly and welcoming people I've ever met. It doesn't matter if you are starting out or experienced, they treat everyone the same. I\u2019ve been a member here for a few months now and I love it! It\u2019s a few minutes of a walk from the Arlington T stop. It doesn\u2019t look like your typical CrossFit location, it\u2019s inside of a really nice building with a furniture store and deli, I got a little confused my first day finding it. Every single coach is great, they give great feedback and are very helpful. You can check the WOD on an app called SugarWOD and their programming is excellent. I always look forward to their workouts, they\u2019re just the right amount of challenging. I\u2019ve been to many CrossFit gyms and this one I highly recommend!! My wife and I were visiting from Denver, CO for our 5 year wedding anniversary. When we travel it is a ritual that I visit the local gym and she (the garden or coffee shop). Either way I enjoyed my time during open gym. Alex was very hospitable. I enjoyed training in the basement of their gym to continue to prep for an upcoming Powerlifting meet. Thank you for the visit. Ridiculous that both the cover and the bar are cash only. If you\u2019re going to operate like it\u2019s 1995, at least waive the cover charge. Their excuse? \u2018There\u2019s an ATM.\u2019 Yeah, with fees.  My cash that I had was for the drag show. Not for the bar owners to avoid transaction fees. Don\u2019t even bother. Extremely rude bartenders. Didn\u2019t know that the system worked as one transaction not open tab, like everywhere else. We were planning on getting drinks and then tipping at the end, since we were seated at the bar anyways. Bartender preceded to throw our change back and later come over and sarcastically say \u201cthanks for the tip\u201d and preceded to ignore us for the rest of the event when I tried to order another drink. Even when I tried to explain we were going to after getting another drink he purposefully ignored me. Bartender was not only rude to us but every other person who was confused over it as well (which was literally everyone else around us sitting at the bar). Unfortunate too because I really liked the drag show and the atmosphere. After the service I received I\u2019m never returning, definitely killed the vibe. Don\u2019t recommend going unless you\u2019re avoiding the bar. I attended the Cannabis Cabaret event at Jaques Bar on January 18, 2025, from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM, and unfortunately, my experience was deeply upsetting. The bartender, Chucky, was incredibly unprofessional and exhibited behavior that I can only describe as racially discriminatory toward me and another person of color (POC) sitting nearby.\n\nI was trying to place an order and asked the gentleman next to me to get the bartender's attention. Despite the request, Chucky ignored him and continued to play on his phone. Moments later, he served a white patron sitting across the bar, but still disregarded my attempts to engage. Not once, but twice, I said \"excuse me\" to get his attention and place an order, only for him to walk past me and ignore my request. He proceeded to walk up and down the bar, chatting with vendors while I visibly became upset.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I started asking surrounding patrons, \"Isn't he the bartender? Isn't this his job?\" that the other guests began to notice the clear disrespect I was receiving. The people next to me were visibly shocked and even commented on how inappropriate and offensive it was.\n\nI have never felt more unwelcome at a bar, especially when I was being polite, respectful, and spending money. This kind of behavior\u2014treating POC like second-class citizens\u2014is unacceptable and reflects poorly on this establishment. It makes me feel as though POC are not valued or appreciated here.\n\nI do not recommend this bar to any person of color, as the experience was not just disappointing but outright disrespectful. I will not be returning, and I encourage others to think twice before spending their money here. This was our finale for a bachelorette party, and it was a great choice. It's a small bar, with some large, and in charge, entertainment. (It's a drag club, so extra flare.) The ladies performing all had their own style, and it was a lot of fun! One of the women did songs that you knew, but with a dirty dirty twist, and she was hilarious to watch perform! My favorite had some serious 'tude in a great way! She gave grief (in a fun way) to those being cheap and only offering a dollar tip, have some sassy side eye, and other things like it. She also had my favorite performances, too. Most of her outfits had movement to them, or she changed part of the way through, or both. She had some serious moves, too. They pulled all those celebrating birthdays up, and then, they got up all those celebrating engagements. I like that they gave all of the people a second to really shine and celebrate their big event.\nAlso I was in charge of organizing for the bachelorette party, and the guests sucked. I think I called 4 times in one (that day) day to change the number, because of last minute additions and drop outs. They were so great to accommodate me, and I'm really grateful that my cousins bachelorette party wasn't ruined by the guests.\nGreat place for a fun night! This was my first experience at a drag show, and I was excited to see their May 4th special. The performers were a lot of fun and the overall vibe of the club was very relaxed and welcoming. Do be aware that tipping the performers is encouraged, so definitely recommend bringing cash with you to the show! The show was very interactive, with the performers moving around the audience throughout their acts. We had a lot of fun, and would definitely come again."

    "reviews": "When you first enter, this seems like a smaller CVS until you realize there's a second floor. Overall good service but the store does feel a bit messy. I still don't know why they lock up some of their items. Just get better security instead of making the honest people wait around for someone to unlock the shaving cream. I was very sad today to witness a black male being racially profiled by the cashier managing the self check out section, at around 2 pm today. He asked her if they had soap containers, she told him to pay 1st & then she would help him find the soap container, she then accused him of attempting to steal when everyone there could clearly see that he wanted to buy the soap container & everything else he planned to purchase all at once.\n\nWhen the individual walked in the store, he was followed. I could hear the cashier telling the guy, \"I know what you are trying to do\". The guy replied, \" I have no idea what you are talking about\". In the end, he paid for all his items & politely thanked her even though she was extremely rude to him. I've seen this employee smoking cigarettes by the front entrance on multiple occasions so I recognized her. She is a brunette, looks like she is in her 50's, or 60's. This was very sad to watch, I really hope this review will prevent this from happening to other customers in the future. I wish there was a way to give 0 stars. Great CVS! The store itself was standard, but the staff was nice, especially Rita. Welcoming experience and I was able to get what I needed quickly! TERRIBLE customer service upstairs. We went to get passport photos done. There was 2 employees and no customers and despite us asking for help both continued doing what they were doing. Once someone finally stopped to assist us, she couldn\u2019t even tell us the pricing. We walked back out. What a great pharmacy.  I needed a prescription filled pronto and the urgent care was next door.  They were able to process my prescription within 20 minutes and Rubi was super nice Stellar service and a great crew. I walked out of work on a dark, cold rainy night to a flat tire, 10 miles from home, and I didn't have a repair kit. I limped there and they threw my bike on the stand and got to work. I've ridden many miles and visited countless shops and the group here was the most personable and welcoming I've come across. I'll be back without a doubt. As a non-athletic, femme Person of Color, I\u2019ve only had good experiences at Community Bicycle Supply. I\u2019ve come to order bike parts, get advice, and I recently got a tuneup from them. The customer service has always been really warm and outstandingly helpful. I\u2019ve never walked away feeling overcharged or talked down to. Thanks to the CBS team!! Hey everyone, check out My Community Bike store! I've been a loyal customer since I was a young kid, and now as a dad with back problems, I've found the perfect solution with my awesome Gravel Bike! Huge shoutout to the incredible team who helped me build and maintain this fantastic bike, which is not only comfortable but also a blast to ride! Keep up the amazing work, guys! Woohoo! Fast service at a great price. $20 for a shifter cable replacement and gear readjustment. Overall good service with a good price, although they recommended a kickstand that didn't fit my bike. I brought an old bike and Fabian gave it back to me almost new! Changed Stem, fix gears, brakes. Everything! He is explains to you everything that needs to be fix and works right away. Amazing experience I come to this location with my family all the time and there\u2019s 2 reasons why I\u2019ve taken 2 stars off my review mainly because of customer service.\n\n1. There\u2019s a tall white security guard with a beard (Maybe the lead) that roams around with a cart as a \u201csecret shopper\u201d that makes everyone feel uneasy. I understand that he\u2019s \u201cdoing his job\u201d but not everyone is a criminal and that\u2019s exactly how he makes my family and I feel. Loosen up and make the guests here at whole foods feel welcomed instead of criminals.\n\n2. There\u2019s 2 older Latino workers who work in the deli department. With my experiences ordering with them, they\u2019ve been rude. I order the chefs plate quite often and it\u2019s the same customer service every single time. The older Latino gentleman and woman have a nasty attitude. It makes it hard for me to want to order any more food from there with the type of attitude they project. It\u2019s sad because the ready cooked food tastes delicious but now it shy\u2019s me away to order anymore because I don\u2019t want to interact with them anymore. I don\u2019t want anyone to lose their job but please I hope this review comes to light so that you guys can talk to them and potentially retrain them on customer service.\n\nEveryone else has been great and delightful so I don\u2019t want to take anything away from those staff! This supermarket is conveniently located and offers a comprehensive selection of products. It carries a wide range of raw ingredients, fresh fruits, and vegetables, as well as a diverse assortment of prepared foods. Customers can find soups, salads, rice, and meats representing various culinary traditions, making it a one-stop destination for quality ingredients and ready-to-eat meals I loved shopping at this whole foods. It had a wide selection of choices of fresh fruit, veggies,salads,etc. I love turkey cobb salad - my fav to buy at whole foods. Always a pleasant experience at Whole Foods, my comfort grocery store when I'm traveling. Very dependable for generally healthy stuff. I've been a regular shopper at this Whole Foods since its grand opening back in 2015 and have seen many of its changes and challenges since then: from having an in store spa, a fish shack, a cozy in-store seating area next to the coffee bar that is now an Amazon package center, to lining up and waiting through long lines in the parking lot and social distancing because of the COVID era, and even the blacktop stir-fry area reappearing after years of trying other types of pop-ups.\n\nI'm writing this review because I just got back from a quick visit there, bringing in my electric scooter and reusable Whole Foods bag.  I was literally in and out just intending to buy a couple vitamin drinks only to find that they weren't in stock so I just quickly left and one of the security guards who was probably eyeing me quickly ran out through the entrance as I was exiting to stare me down because presumably maybe taking out and putting on my own sunglasses was something I grabbed from the store without paying.  These guards need to be more discerning.  Had I been wearing \"regular\" clothes and looking less like a bum wearing sweats and old sneakers, I'm sure I would've been less of a target for being tracked in the store.\n\nIt's very understandable these days with the news reporting shoplifting has risen greatly, especially with self-checkout kiosks appearing at nearly every major retail store to save costs.  I honestly don't even know the solution to this current societal issue.  However, in addition to many of these unfavorable (in my opinion) changes this store has undergone, I can't shake the uneasiness I feel with regards to the direction this Whole Foods location, and maybe Whole Foods in general, is going.\n\nWhole Foods, especially this biggest location in metro Boston, used to be about community and creativity, where people would go to stay and hang out a bit and chefs were able to try new recipes and have them out at the hot bar.  Obviously the pandemic changed a lot, and then after Amazon acquired Whole Foods, the idea of building community and fostering creativity has been sacrificed towards cutting costs and now we just see the same exact foods at the hot bar everyday.\n\nWhile Whole Foods still has the best produce and a great selection of products one might not be able to get elsewhere, because of this incident and the many other changes over the years, I have become a little more likely to shop at competitors like Shop & Shop and Star Market (they've upped their game a little bit in recent years). Lots of options throughout the store. Competitive pricing too. Seafood and veggie selections are great. Got a nice piece of flounder and a variety of soup dumplings to taste test. I went for the freshly cut pork ribs. Good prices. Clean cut.\nBut they probably have whatever Asian food prep you're looking at good prices and quantities. The right place to buy fresh sea fish, fresh fruits and vegetables in great prices, for Boston. You can take your fish clean without extra cost. You also have the opportunity to experiment with the great and mostly unknown variety of the Asian food products. The only downside is the difficulty in communication. Avoid this supermarket. During a recent visit, we noticed multiple mice in the fresh produce section. The store appears to neglect proper hygiene standards, posing a significant health risk. We have alerted the Boston Public Health Commission about this issue. This supermarket is ok.  It is not particularly dirty among Asian supermarkets although cannot be compared to Hmart.  The product display is a bit messy with things here and there but prices are better than in H Mart.  There\u2019s a small parking lot across the street for shoppers. Again, this Asian supermarket is okay. Is amazing large selection great prices. Seafood was extremely fresh. Highly recommend I have been shopping here for many years. Same convenience, good collection of Chinese groceries, vegetables, fresh fish, seafood, meat,  etc. , the same mess and crowds and the same hardworking people. They also make extra parking lot available during weekends right next to the main parking lot and it is always convenient to park and shop there. Good place to shop. But the people that shop there are very very rude. Make sure not to be in any body's way because they will run you over with their cart. Well let\u2019s not judging the cleanness or the attitudes of the cashiers. It\u2019s Chinese market, we came here for the groceries that we don\u2019t get from Whole Foods or Costco. They carry enough options for seafood, which is a huge plus. Vegetables are fresh. Meats are ok. Need more Asian snacks though. This is our regular grocery stop. Fresh produce with great deals! Parking sometimes can be chaotic. If you come on weekends, try come early in the morning I absolutely love Bootleg Special!\n\nTheir brunch has to be the best in Boston. That Brunch garlic noodle, Bootleg Benedict, and jiggly pancakes are to die for!\n\nThey recently launch new menu items and I am obsessed with the Short Ribs Garlic Noodle!\n\nThe ambiance has a NOLA speakeasy vibe and service is incredibly friendly!\n\nThis is worth making a trip for with your girlfriends, a date, or gathering! Nice cozy place. Take your time to explore the menu for the first time. Nice drink selection. Nice ambience. Unique sea food menu. Don't remember seeing chicken options when we went there for brunch. Noodles and pan cake must try. Passion fruit pineapple mocktail with salt on the rim was amazing. go for big platters. Very tempting This is one of our favorite restaurants in Boston. I'm a shot and a beer guy, but my wife says the cocktails are fantastic. Thursdays are all day dollar oysters, hell yeah. The menu routinely gets new entrees. The must-trys are the garlic noodles with shrimp and the squid ink fried rice. The seafood boils are entree-sized but definitely sharable if you add a few other small plates with it. We've probably tried 70% of the menu and loved every bit of it. Highly recommended. Living in the South End all my life, I\u2019ve been blessed with so many unique restaurants nearby. We even have a seafood boil restaurant! Bootleg Special\u2019s seafood boil is amazing and the garlic noodle is a must! The drinks are super fun and the vibe, NOLA speakeasy. Love it.\n\nYesterday was the first time I stopped by for brunch and it has to be Boston\u2019s best brunch spot! It is great for dates, girls outing, friends and family gatherings. Let\u2019s just say it can accommodate any occasion because it\u2019s such a fun and unique experience.\n\nI really enjoyed their brunch menu which include souffl\u00e9 pancakes, bootleg Benedict, and brunch garlic noodles. They also have MANY gluten free options.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried their newly launched menu item, the ConeNado and my favorite was the lobster clam chowder! Super fun and delicious!\n\nThis is a must visit! A lobster boil has been on my food bucket list for a minute now, and this place came highly recommended for it's pseudo-speakeasy vibe. We loved it! The service was friendly, the Bootleg Special boil was phenomenal, and the signature sauce was to die for. My girlfriend thoroughly enjoyed her cocktail too, saying it was the best drink she's had in a while. Usually love blackbird , however their iced coffee isn\u2019t the same as it was back in 2022/2023 - seems to be a different formula now , which is mediocre and comparable to dunkin or Starbucks.\n\nMy main gripe that made it worth making a review is getting this after looking forward to having breakfast an hour away from black bird I am greeted with what seems to be blatant ignorance by the cook where bacon was put into my sandwich with clear instructions not to put bacon.\n\nNever understood why bacon is a default in these sandwiches. It seems like \u201cno bacon\u201d doesn\u2019t compute for most cafe\u2019s , as if they think I never tried bacon and once I do I\u2019ll be converted.\n\nWhat a why to ruin an anticipated breakfast. I've come to this Blackbird location multiple times over a few years.  The service is always great.  For their doughnuts, they are more on the soft-cake-y side.  I prefer old-fashioned styled which they don't seem to have.  Recently though I've been coming here for the cinnamon roll that they sell for $7 and it is huge and tasty!  It is about 3 times the size of their doughnuts.  A bit too much frosting, but going forward, I think I will only be coming here for the cinnamon roll. I was excited when I learned that the Everything Bagel was the doughnut of the week because I had been wanting to try Blackbird Doughnuts and heard that this was one of its signature doughnuts. With the promotion, the doughnut was $1.93 pre-tax. Unfortunately, it was a huge letdown. The biggest issue was that it was too oily, dry, and tasted like it was fried in old oil, which you can tell from the dark color of the doughnut. The cream cheese and everything seasoning for sure made it taste like a bagel, but I would have rather eaten a regular bagel than a bad doughnut. I don't know if I got a bad batch or if the doughnuts are usually like this, but I'm not sure I'll come back anytime soon. We got chocolate frosted glazed and a birthday cake donut they were absolutely terrible and for the money you pay for these donut jeez wonder how they are still open. This should say something they make Dunkin' Donuts donuts seem like premium donuts Disappointed. I heard a lot about Blackbird so when I got the chance to visit I made an order. So many regrets.\n\nThey messed up our order so badly, and my donut was VERY bland. I got the Boston Cream and for something that simple I expected an ounce of flavor. None. Not even sweetness. It was stale and flavorless. Donuts are the staple how do you mess that up. What a shame.\n\nMy friend ordered the miso tofu salad and marked a meat allergy on his order. Got a full side order of chicken in his salad. Luckily the fries and the hash browns were decent so we got somewhat of a breakfast to start the day. Stop by today at 1pm to get a sandwich for dinner while at work tonight for my 3pm to 9 pm shift. I ordered The Gobbler it contains roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, garlic aioli, gravy on a sub roll. The turkey was fresh tasted good, the stuffing was good moist and seasoned, garlic wasn\u2019t over powering, gravy was missing??????? The sub roll was good tasted fresh. I would have giving a 5 star for this review but Sally\u2019s Sandwich FORGOT to add the gravy on my sandwich! The kitchen staff dropped the ball on this one! Maybe management will contact me after reading this? The sandwich was delicious. I used to like this place. They used to make their sandwiches fresh\u2026.. not anymore. Paid $14 for a tiny pre-made wrap. Didn\u2019t taste good and as a student it was far too expensive for the size and quality. A horrible misuse of a Harvard space and drastically worse food and pricing then every other Harvard student go-to in the square. Needs to be replaced. Clearly the new ownership has dropped the ball completely. Might as well turn it into an ugly empty kiosk.\n\nedit: This review was meant for the Harvard Square location in Smith Campus center -- although same business. I can imagine this location (being more full-fledged) would be much better. I ordered online and decided to try their Steak + Cheese!\n\nstrip steak, jalapeno-cheddar cheese, provolone cheese, caramelized onion, lettuce, pickles, torpedo roll\n\nThe bread was soggy. Steak chunks were way too big and many pieces were more than bite size, fatty and chewy. Steak quality wasn't bad but did taste as if it were just reheated. The sub was doused in sauce and leaking. Sunday , we came here. The line move along with everyone social distancing. I got the honey bun swirl and pineapple Coconut. Both were soft and fluffy. Pineapple coconut tasted like pina colada. The honey bun swirl was way to sweet for me . It was about $3.50 a donut. Worth a try We stopped for doughnuts and got breakfast tacos and avocado toast too! The breakfast taco with barbacoa is a pretty fabulous way to start the day. And it is gluten free! The avocado toast with scrambled eggs was devoured in minutes by my kids. A hidden gem. Whenever I return to Boston, I make it a point to stop and get a slice of pizza here. The crust was thin/crispy and the pizza had the right amount of \u2019flop\u2019. Non-pretentious and friendly. Recommended \ud83e\udd19 We ordered food one and a half hous ago. It was supposed to arrive an hour ago, but it didn't. I also called an hour ago. The man on the phone said he would put a rush on it, couldn't tell me however how long it would take for the food to get to us (aka how much longer I would have to sit & wait in the lobby). Now we can't reach anyone anymore.\nI want my money back. Support locally/family owned and operated businesses, or else the neighborhood will become as sterile as the seaport. Very tasty pizza and most importantly - not overcooked! Pizza is super good haven\u2019t been here in a year there still one of the best pizza I ever had and the fries are super to Yellow Door Tequila was a wonderful experience! While we didn\u2019t even eat, we had all the drinks and plenty of tequila! The service at the bar was immaculate and a wonderful engaging time. Highly recommend a stop here if you\u2019re around the Ink Block area. I typically order take out from Yellow Door Taqueria in Lower Miller. I didn\u2019t realize the menus were slightly different. Overall, I recommend the food and restaurant. We ordered a few different things:\n\nOn sundays, they have $1 oysters\n\nWe started off with some mocktails - presentation was really nice and overall it was a nice drink. It like the ginger beer & lime combo.\n\nThe chips, queso and guacamole are a great way to start your meal. I tried two new items: spicy tuna tartare and carnitas tacos. They weren\u2019t my favorite. I ordered some food items to be delivered. Upon arrival the food was lukewarm only. But the taste was really good. I had a cheese quesadilla, patatas bravas and nachos. The seasoning of the food was quite good in my opinion, however, I did not always understand the dishes and the sauces that came with them, which in the end was not too important, as I ate everything with everything. Honestly love yellow door. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re going out to dinner, grabbing a drink, or catching up with a friend it\u2019s always great vibes. Our waitress Ayah was so down to earth and super fun. She gave so many good recs and made it a great dinner. Ask for Ayah if you go! Skip this spot!!!! & if you\u2019re poc I promise you won\u2019t like it at all. So UNSEASONED\n1. the food was so bad. Literally so UNFLAVORFUL, DRY AND the tacos came COLD\u2026?\n\nWe ordered the chips and guacamole ($13) and they have a SMALL BOWL only half full of guacamole. We had to ask our server about it because it felt like we were scammed.\n\nThe service was fine, server was nice and replaced our guacamole for a proper one after we complained.\n\nThe drinks were sickeningly sweet\u2026 came with spiral straws?? Like for children??\n\nOverall would not recommend this spot, the food was not enjoyable and it\u2019s honestly unacceptable for the price. (6-8 dollars each for a taco). If you wanna go to a spot that has better drinks and tacos go to La borrachito in Seaport instead of this place. Convenient central location, good food (really liked the pasta). The octopus and shrimps were delicious as well.\nIt seems a bit of an upscale restaurant, however they welcomed everyone. Came here before a show at the royale. Website was enticing and the daughter had come for brunch ages ago.  First ordered a manhattan. No special alcohol. Not bad, but they need to up the vermouth quality.  A little too harsh. Had the broccoli rabe arancini. Nice taste but served at room temperature. I would have preferred them hot. Ordered a Nebbiolo. First one was really harsh. The more expensive one was at least drinkable at 16$ per glass. Final course was the bucatini amatriciana.  Really nice but too much sauce. Looking at other dishes this seems to be the norm.  Pasta was perfectly al dente. Service was just right (I sat at the bar). Would come back and try maybe some of the crudo or other items. I think they are four star capable.  Oh by the way I consider the 4% kitchen charge a service fee. Basically a tip.  So I\u2019m figuring that into the gratuity I leave. We went to Bar Mezzana for New Year\u2019s Eve dinner it was one of the best meals that we have ever had. We had the grilled octopus and the orecchiette which were absolutely amazing - an absolute must. We also had the wagyu tartar which we would highly recommend as well Our family had the private room last night at Bar Mezzana for an important family dinner, and WOW, did Heather and Colin Lynch do a SPECTACULAR job!! The cocktails, appetizers, mains, and desserts were uniformly outstanding, and the service and atmosphere were wonderful.\n\nWalking in, the vibe was exactly what we needed on a cold, rainy night. In short, the evening was perfect!!\n\nWe got to know Heather and Colin on a trip to Italy last year, so seeing them at their restaurant last night was a real treat! They take Boston hospitality to the very top!!! Loved everything about our dinner. Food was superb. The service and ambiance was great.  Nice wine list. This restaurant is great for special occasions or just weekend dinner. My favorite was razor clams crudo. Not a lot of places have razor clams.  If you never had them, worth a try. Chiopino was fantastic too. My husband and I found this gem in Harvard square. I had the tomato basil soup, chicken salad sandwich, and blood orange iced tea. He had the short rib grilled cheese. Both delicious! We enjoyed it so much, we ate breakfast there twice after during our stay. We tried the smoked salmon, avocado, and egg sandwich, the prosciutto and parm eggs, and the breakfast sandwich. All utterly delicious. My only big negative was we tried the sweet French toast on our last visit. It was not at all what we were hoping for which was a modern take on French toast. The ricotta goat cheese topping was a big miss for us. I would, however, gladly go there should we find ourselves back in Boston! What a special place! I was in Boston for a business trip and came here every morning for a relaxed and delicious coffee and breakfast. My colleagues and I had amazing meals and service each day. The portions are generous and the food is well prepared, and presented beautifully. I will seek this cafe out whenever I travel to a city where they are located. I\u2019ve labeled my pics so you know what we ordered so you can see how delicious they looked, and they tasted even better! My Daughter loved her pistachio tart and I Had a danish\u2019s cherry and cheese \u201cdelicious\u201d, we like a lot the concept order first and get a table, we got a sharable table, the coffee was good, my Wese breakfast was not what I was expecting, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was bad, it was different. They have a lot of stores around downtown Boston. Be sure to arrive early \u201c Saturday 9 am was perfect by 920 the place was packed \u201c The food was absolutely delicious. The breakfast plate was my favourite. The minted hash browns were great, the bacon and eggs were lovely. Definitely add the beef sausage. It\u2019s the best part.\n\nThe granola bowl with fruit was perfect. So fresh, a perfect start to the day.\n\nThe juices were ok but not to my taste. And the turmeric and honey latte just ended up as a sludge in the cup and wasn\u2019t mixed properly. So it wasn\u2019t very nice to drink.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend. If you get one thing\u2026. Get the black sesame latte. You will not be disappointed. The food was good as well\u2026 zero complaints. You order at the counter and the bring it to you type of place so make sure you know what you want before you come, or you will stand in line forever. The vibes are good here though - come early if you can so you can get a seat. I have been here twice so far and the service is always welcoming. I\u2019ve always wanted a coffee shop I can go to and just chill and do my homework. Great atmosphere and the music is definitely my vibe, this just may be my favorite place to go. The prices are reasonable, I mainly just get a bagel w/ cream cheese and a green iced tea and i\u2019m satisfied! Love this place. I have been to both locations and all baristas have been very kind and sympathetic with me. The owner is really nice, if you go early morning, you might get to see him. Their pies \ud83e\udd67 are delicious and is a nice cozy aussie space that makes me feel like I\u2019m over there. I love every detail from the decorations. I recommend the coffee that has ice cream that is only available in the Traveler\u2019s location. This place is awesome. I love \u2764\ufe0f it... Great Fresh Matcha Latte with Honey and Cinnamon. Elizabeth from Oregon did Amazing job \ud83d\udc4f I don\u2019t know what this place is Paying her but they Should Pay her more... You have a great person on your team... I would highly recommend this place to anyone and I'll definitely be back again. Near but Far. Great job Elizabeth I hope you enjoy Massachusetts living. Good looks. Shane Great cappuccino and other coffee. They\u2019ll make it the way you want. Nice place to sit and sip. You can have your drink in a real mug. Interesting Australian pastry to try, but a bit pricey. If you\u2019re in the Ink Block area if them a try. Fast-forward a few years and I stopped by to see how things were. Amazing to see it just as I remembered, if not even better! Got my favorite Aussie pie, a cup of coffee and took some beans with me to brew up when I'm back on the West Coast. The service was solid, and Todd (owner) still does a great job finding good people full of character to work for him. Look forward to the next visit!\n\nMy favorite coffee shop in the city. I've been a regular for over a year now and highly recommend their espresso drinks and aussie pies. My favorite pie is the Chicken Curry Vegetable, but honestly they are all good. I have to admit that I get a flavored latte, but the espresso is excellent. The owner is an Australian who appreciates the art of coffee and quality service. His staff are all different characters but provide great service. Everyone I bring here has enjoyed the coffee, food and atmosphere. Not a Peet\u2019s. It\u2019s a Capitol One cafe now. Awful I have been here twice so far and the service is always welcoming. I\u2019ve always wanted a coffee shop I can go to and just chill and do my homework.

    "reviews": "Former customer as of today.  Closed my account because of repeated problems caused by there online banking team. Tried to resolve the matter over the phone.  AND WAS HUNG UP ON BY THE STAFF.  HAD TO ARRIVE IN PERSON AND CLOSED MY ACCOUNT.  STAFF IS USELESS. Visited the Cohasset branch to attempt to fix an issue with Online Banking Bill Pay.  Branch Manager opened a ticket and the matter is still unresolved.  Tried to go to the main location and waited for over an hour and the team member then came to us and passed the issue onto another person.  Still unresolved.  It was a no brainer to pull the money from this bank. The service is really going down hill. I received horrible service from the manager Ivonne at Hingham Branch . She hung up on me without asking how can I help you . Gave me no assistance. Told me to go on web page to find the spelling of her name .\nWould never use this branch again . The other branch in Hull was very professional and kind . I was in tears from receiving the Kindness from\nHull branch . Helpful and honest\nThe only bank we need downtown\nMonday, September 5, 2022 CE, 20:42 EST HIFS is a great bank and though it gives you the attention of a small bank, it has the resources of a large bank. We had the best experience engagement ring and wedding band shopping at Laura Preshong! The customer service is unmatched. I was very unsure and set up several appointments to \u201cdouble check\u201d if the ring I thought I wanted was really the one. Everyone we worked with was patient, personable, and helpful. In-person and email communication was timely and informative.  We were hoping to go local with this purchase and find somewhere with a focus on ethically sourced gems and metals. We found all this and more with Laura Preshong! My engagement ring and wedding band are both from Laura Preshong, and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding band will be as well! Not only are the pieces beautifully crafted and the design well thought out, but the team here is 11/10. Warm, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable, my fianc\u00e9 and I couldn\u2019t have had a better experience! We will definitely continue to be loyal customers beyond our wedding later this year \ud83d\ude0a We had such a fantastic experience at Laura Preshong when we bought my engagement ring. I was looking for ethical diamonds, likely lab grown, and I really liked the styles I saw on the website. We had our consultation with Joe who taught us about diamonds and made us feel very comfortable. After that we picked out a few options and had a follow up to see the stones in person before making the final selection. The team at Laura Preshong guided us through the whole process. There was no pressure to choose something we didn't want and the experience was easy and enjoyable. Laura Preshong was the only jeweler I visited for my engagement ring and I am so happy I found them first.\n\nA few months into wearing my ring I needed a repair and I had another good experience with the team at Laura Preshong as they handled the repair. I plan to purchase my wedding band through them as well, as I have been very happy with my experience thus far. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a consultation at Laura Preshong so I could get an idea of what type of engagement ring I wanted. The staff was incredibly helpful and thoughtful, and at no point during our appointment did we feel pressured to purchase a ring. My fianc\u00e9 worked with the staff at Laura Preshong to create the ring of my dreams. Laura Preshong did a phenomenal job from start to finish. I could not recommend them enough. Our experience here was amazing! We went in as a couple and I had previously been ring shopping with my older brother when he was shopping for his now wife. Our ring buying experiences were completely different. At Laura Preshong, we worked with 2 wonderful sales people that walked us through and explained throughly what we would be buying, what impacts the price of a diamond, and what the pros and cons of each setting would be as well as the 4Cs. They stayed within our budget and were not pushy at all - unlike when I went with my older brother to a different jeweler. The amount of compliments on my ring - even people I wouldn\u2019t expect are texting me outside of regular congratulations to ask where we got it and what they can search for! Truly a dream to work with! I usually refrain from leaving negative reviews, but my recent experience was far from pleasant. Working in the beauty industry, I found the service unacceptable. My manicure felt rushed, prompting me to ask the nail tech to fix some nails she had already worked on. Observing neighboring customers receiving meticulous care and hand massages added to my disappointment. When I pointed out the incorrectly painted nails, the nail tech abruptly walked away mid-conversation and hastily painted over the errors. The aftermath revealed the extent of the botched job on my fingernails. This subpar service left me greatly disheartened, especially given my professional background in the industry. I was visiting Boston for a conference and stumbled upon this nail salon near my hotel. Staff was great. Prices great compared to the nail salon 2 doors away. My go-to staff member is Sara. She\u2019s incredibly attentive and excellent at her work. She\u2019s also very kind and even stayed well past closing to ensure my nails were completely dry before I left. Overall it was good but not fantastic. It felt a little rushed the pedicure itself. Affordable though and good place if you want to go regularly and not break the bank. mai did a fantastic acrylic overlay on my hands with such a beautiful design. i also had one of the best pedicures in my life ever with connor! thank you both for doing such a great job, truly in love with my hands and cannot stop looking at them Great food with friendly service\n\nHad soppressata, zucca and broccolini for three people. I really enjoyed soppeessata (pizza) which was savory with hint of sweetness from honey. Zucca was good-olive was a great kick that went well with the overall dish. Broccolini was my favorite;  it was not too strong nor bland. Seasoned well with grinded cheese and spices. Coppa Enoteca offers a delightful dining experience with its charming ambiance and exquisite cuisine. Nestled in a cozy corner, the atmosphere exudes warmth, perfect for a romantic dinner or a gathering of friends. The menu boasts a tantalizing selection of Italian dishes, each crafted with precision and bursting with flavor. From the creamy risottos to the succulent pasta dishes, every bite is a culinary delight. The wine list is extensive, featuring both local and imported wines to complement your meal beautifully. The attentive staff adds to the overall experience, providing impeccable service without being intrusive. Whether you're a food enthusiast or simply seeking a memorable dining experience, Coppa Enoteca is a must-visit destination. Came here to celebrate a birthday dinner and it was quite fantastic. First of all our server was absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe food was also equally delicious. He gave us great recommendations on what to try and what would pair well with what we had ordered. My wife is vegetarian so he was even able to give us the veggie options that weren't on menu.\n\nThe meatballs are extremely good and the citrus salad was so yummy. The pizza was light and crispy.\n\nThe location itself is small but very cozy. A good cocktail and wine list as well. I would highly recommend this place for food! Ladies and Gentlemen, the FRESHEST daily made jam I\u2019ve EVER had on top of their crispy toast which was to die for. Of course it\u2019s Italian so I had to try the brick oven pizza and it was jam-packed with flavor with fresh/clean ingredients. Lastly ONLY on Sunday during brunch did I get to try their yogurt bowl in their special menu that\u2019s only available on that day of the week and that time. Yogurt was good but the flavor is VERY sharp so it may not be for everyone.\n\nJoin me in tracking down the best bites! The food here is amazing! You cannot go wrong with a single thing. I personally adore the celery Caesar salad and you cannot go wrong with any of the pizzas. It does feel extremely cramped in the restaurant but when the tables outside are available, it\u2019s a game changer. They could do a better job at presentation and organizing their products. The lighting is too bright. It looks like a cheap dollar store but they have really nice youthful and trendy clothes. Good store.nice lottery store. I hit for 10 gs there Clean and new guy behind the counter is pleasant! I love this store the people are so nice My guys here are good people Nice cafe in the South End, a bit expensive but the scones are really nice and a good stop if you\u2019re in the area. The butterscotch scone was full of chips and flavor, fluffy on the inside, and a good size.\n\nCoffee was okay, I prefer the dark roast more than the light. Cafe part gets extremely crowded so be prepared to take it to go or sit outside. A good stop for a quick bite!\n\nOverall not my favorite place in the area but solid! Excellent brunch in the South End! The smoked salmon in the smoked salmon and eggs was amazing. The eggs were pretty good too, but the salmon was really the star. The waiter recommended the guava mimosa which was delicious! Seating is a little crowded but not too squished. It was a rainy day, but the staff were very welcoming. Enjoyed several pastries. Great eats on a less than stellar weather day. My son loved it. Went for dinner and was not disappointed! Food was amazing. We got the Mezze (with all three spreads - the whipped red pepper feta was my favorite), Crispy Calamari & Mussels as well as the Fish&Chips (with truffle fries) to share. We also all got some drinks from the bar which were also tasty. For dessert we did the Affogato with pistachio icecream and that was incredible! The ice-cream itself was super creamy and the cookies it came with were a great bite. Service was fantastic - a little slow but we didn\u2019t mind as we were in no rush. 10/10! I recently had breakfast at the South End Buttery in Boston, and I'd like to share my thoughts for those considering a visit. First and foremost, the venue itself is quite charming, situated in a lovely neighborhood that adds to its appeal. Upon our early morning arrival, we were greeted by a completely empty restaurant. Despite this, and not having a reservation, our request to be seated along the edge of the room was unfortunately not accommodated, and we found ourselves placed right in the center of the empty space downstairs.\n\nAs for the food, I opted for the mushroom omelette. The dish was presented neatly, and while the ingredients were fresh, I found the overall size quite small for the price point. The flavors, though unique, didn't quite harmonize as well as I had hoped, leading to an overall okay but not memorable culinary experience. Also the cheese in my omelette wasn\u2019t melted.\n\nOn the note of value, I felt the pricing was a bit steep relative to the portion sizes and the culinary experience provided.\n\nTo sum up, while the South End Buttery has its charms and the setting is undeniably pleasant, my visit left me feeling that there's room for improvement in terms of seating flexibility, portion sizes, and flavor combinations. It's a decent spot for those in the area who are looking for a quick bite in a nice environment, but manage your expectations regarding the culinary experience and pricing."

    "reviews": "All the staff member are very professional, friendly and kind. Excellent visit every time I go to the eye clinic and dental department. 100 out of 10. Always thankful. Can you guys please train your reception staff to not start their tone and attitude with the intention of getting defensive with patients? I\u2019ve made a couple of appointments to this place and I\u2019ve been received with a receptionist who clearly has a micro aggressive attitude. She starts off sounding annoyed from the start, almost like she\u2019s bored or tired of her job, but nothing that can\u2019t be overlooked, however when you start asking questions, or you don\u2019t know certain things, she starts to sound condescending and rude, but makes it very subtle so you can\u2019t just point it out to her as easily. This has happened 3 times with the same person. I noticed she becomes more reactive towards me when I get more assertive, almost like she\u2019s just actively waiting for someone to get snappy with her so that she has a reason to be rude to you. Feed into her energy and she will gladly give you the attitude she intended to give you in the first place. She seems to be a Latina woman with a deep voice. Everyone else I\u2019ve spoken to here has been lovely, but this lady in particular sounds like she gets a kick out of taking her anger out on patients. I can\u2019t say enough good things about Neighborhealth! Every experience I\u2019ve had here has been excellent. The care is always top-notch, and I get fast responses through MyChart. Every provider I\u2019ve seen\u2014whether for medical, mental health, imaging, or dental\u2014has been amazing. The entire team is compassionate, professional, and truly dedicated to their patients. I always feel well taken care of, and I\u2019m so grateful for their outstanding service. Thank you, NeighborHealth south End I am new to SENH and I have been truly impressed with the staff and accommodations at this facility.  The friendly atmosphere, very clean waiting areas, location of various sanitary stations and mostly the extremely short (almost no) wait times are a PLUS!\nEveryone was knowledgeable , helpful and efficient.\nKeep up the great job!\n\nKudos! Dr sharma is an excellent doctor but equally is kind and compassionate.  I\u2019m very grateful to have her as my Dentist. Mom loves this brand, so when we were in town visiting, we made it a point to stop by. This is a nice, cute little store with cool running gear inside. It's definitely a spot to visit if you're looking to pick up some fashionable gear. So, here's the deal: my friend and I signed up for the Boston Half Marathon, convinced that our combined experience of playing lacrosse in college nearly 15 years ago and watching a lot of TikTok videos would somehow get us through it. Spoiler alert: It didn't. Fast forward to the night before the race, and we were essentially two panicked humans wearing old college gear, asking ourselves \"Do we even own running socks?\" (One pair between the 2 of us.)\n\nEnter Heartbreak Hill Running Co, our last-minute heroes. We walked in and the team there acted like we were their most important customers\u2014imagine a group of people who just get it. They swiftly figured out what we were missing (which, apparently, was nearly everything). From suggesting the perfect cold weather long sleeve to helping us select the right gels (because who knew there were so many options?!), they were on it.\n\nThe real MVPs were the staff who explained, with infinite patience, that \u201cno, we cannot just eat a granola bar halfway through\u201d and \u201cyes, we do have an entire wall of socks.\u201dThey even explained the difference between hydration and just drinking a lot of water like we weren\u2019t completely clueless. And somehow, despite our lack of preparation, they made us feel like we could run the race without collapsing at the 5-mile mark. (They were right again.)\n\nSo, thank you to Heartbreak Hill Running for being the calm in the storm of our pre-race panic. You may have saved our race day. We will be back again to discuss proper gel opening / eating mid race. Came here with my husband who have been looking for a pair of running shoes that happened to be sold out in a lot of places and countries. We managed to get the pair and Gabby/Abby (cant remember her name) was very attentive and friendly. She is definitely knowledgeable about running shoes and give recommendations/feedback for us. I am a social runner and i didnt feel intimidated going into this store. Definitely carry spot on shoes and running attires. Will return again when we visit Boston! Thank you Staff is super knowledgeable and will help find the right shoe for your foot, also clothes for all conditions, great advice if you need it too, all without any pressure.  Also supper supportive of the local running community, organizing free weekly runs and workouts. I purchased a pair of sneakers about a month ago and they proved to be defective.  While they were past the 15-day return period, Justin, the owner, emailed me and told me that they would exchange them for a different pair.  Awesome customer service! Nothing to look at. And before across the street, wasn\u2019t that great either I have call several times to request an housing application and to ask a few questions and my call it's never answered. It's okay A cool Puerto Rican community Woman closed the door in my face, I asked nicely if she could help me out. My package was pre-labeled. She yelled at me and said I should have walked faster. I asked if she could accept my 1 small package and she yelled and said she gets paid for closing the door at 5:00 and not a minute later. Some kindness would have been appreciated- this world needs more kindness. She was the rudest person I\u2019ve encountered in years. Unionizing her was a bad move. Most absolutely miserable people here. The attitude from the clerks is mind blowing. Simply went in inquiring (not demanding) about a refund for a package that was quoted at 6-8days and still hasn\u2019t been delivered 3 weeks later. Large women behind the counter berated me in front of a line of other customers telling me it\u2019s not her problem, asked me if I knew what the date was because I said \u201calmost a month\u201d as if i had said \u201cexactly a month\u201d. I ended up walking out why she was still running her big mouth while the other customers shook their heads in disbelief and apologized for her. I\u2019ve never been treated this way at what should be a professional establishment. At this point I\u2019m disputing the charge on my CC and I\u2019ll use UPS going forward even if it\u2019s more expensive. Post office is closed during business hours, employee will put sign up and never actually come back. We have been waiting since 2:20 and now it is 3:40 and no one is back from \u201clunch.\u201d Line is out the door and no one is here to help. Insanely unprofessional and irresponsible. Very helpful and kind staff the morning of March 19. Great work! USPS will give you a pink notice in your mailbox if they want you to go to post office to pick up a package. Nowadays I want to measure the size of my mail box and buy accordingly. For example, if the mail box is 6in x 16in, I buy item that can put inside the mailbox. Why? To avoid a trip to Boston South End post office.  Yes, it is that bad. The post office is seriously understaffed. And lack of management beyond comprehension. Everytime I wait at least 40-60 minutes in line to get my package. And it requires only 30 seconds. Please call for backup, I screamed inside my mind. I get better service in cities like Shanghai and Bangkok.\n\nMarch 5 2024 \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f\nI am here to pick up 2 packages. I have 2 notices.\nI can only give you one, the one in the front, but not the one in the back because I am the only staff here. That one, come back tomorrow. Due to rain, customer is less than usual. I wait until the lobby is empty and hand the notice to her the second time. She still refused to go get it. (The one in the back)\nYou are here to serve customer, I am the only customer here. I am not in anybody 's way.\nA nonsense argument last few minutes.\nI go home with 2 packages. I think her name is k, only one alphabet. This review is specific to how good the food was\u2026 I\u2019m not someone who appreciates atmosphere/vibes. If you re someone who loves great food, keep reading. Otherwise, I suggest reading someone else\u2019s reviews:\n\nOne of the best meals of my life. I was so in shock I went again. Go here and follow my order:\n\n1. Zucchini chips - incredible.. sauce is so good\n2. Short rib - perfection\u2026 whoever is making this dish just know I think about you\n3. Feta honey pita thing\u2026 forgot to take a photo but was insanely good\n4. Lamb chops\u2026 perfectly done. Big. I like to meat.\n5. The desert yogurt might be the best thing I ate which makes no sense since it\u2019s yogurt\n\nSince I ve been there twice\u2026 these dishes were good but not really what I ll get again:\n1. Lemon potatoes\u2026 I think I personally don\u2019t like too much lemon. Could be me.\n2. Full fish\u2026 it was good but the other meat is better.\n3.

It was packed when we went for lunch, but the atmosphere was cheerful, everyone having a good time.\nWe tried their 2 best-seller appetizers: the zucchini chips (which I HIGHLY recommend, I get the hype now) and the feta psiti wrapped in phyllo with honey.

Original Greek food all prepared very welll and with top ingredients. Impressive. Tsipouro drink really good. Excellent service reasonable\nprices. Cute little shop.\nUnfortunately at least half of the produce is imported produce sold at an enormous markup. The photo included of a small bag of produce cost $40.\nMany of the items were old. The cabbage hardly has any color, the potatoes are full of growth. They probably should be planted at this point.\nThe popcorn on the cob is fun though. A cute little shop but I have to agree with other reviewers on their treatment with elderlys and specifically Asian people. I don't have time to go into the details of such disrespect from the employees, but want to warn others that our EBT foodstamps benefits were recently stolen after coming here. Whether it be skimmers placed on their devices or the way they process transactions merely just by entering the EBT card number. I can only narrow it down to here because we don't use our EBT foodstamps at a lot of places. A lot of my parents' friends has also experienced the same after coming here. Please be aware of how your family is using their EBT cards here as it is not the most trustworthy way of doing business from what I've seen. Siena Farms is a cute, quaint little shop. Great place for fresh flowers, produce, jarred apple sauce, cheeses, and other local items.\n\nI wish Siena Farms was in every neighborhood, what a great way to support local farmers. \ud83d\udc90 Came here looking for locally-grown leafy greens, maybe for salad, maybe for braising.  Found none.\nOpted for snow peas, cabbage and tomatoes, they are no different than those at my nearby supermarket for 2~3X the price.\nCA-grown asparagus and mangos shipped from afar.\nOne bunch of oyster mushroom does look beautiful.\n5 stars for the store looking so so cute. I purchased 4 Sunflowers and they were very big, bright and vibrant and soo beautiful..I put them in my kitchen and they looked absolutely Lovely and gave me a happy feeling..I would definitely go back to Siena Farms and also try different purchases..the young lady working in the store was very nice and made you feel welcomed in the store. Came here before a show.  Early and sat at the bar. TBH I was planning to get oysters but all they had was wellfleet and they\u2019re only ok to me.\n\nService was super friendly as they were quite empty.\n\nI wasn\u2019t that hungry so while a lot of items looked interesting I had to be judicious.  I first ordered a cosmo.  Only ok.  Weak and tasteless. I\u2019ve had much better.  Two stars.  Then decided on the mussels and a side of fries.  Got a glass of (very nice) rose with them after being offered a taste.\n\nMussels were excellent. Cooked perfectly and the pepper-based sauce was so good. Fries?  Not so much.  Soooo soggy.  The flavor was nice but they were clearly precooked.  I wouldn\u2019t come back here solely on that disappointment. And the \u201ccrostini\u201d or \u201cgrilled bread\u201d that was served with the mussels was very sad.  Even though I loved the sauce I didn\u2019t bother dipping.\n\nThey got busy before I left, and then I was ignored.   Oh well. On to other restaurants in the area.\n\nBill for that - one person - was 70$ before tip. Also they charge a 3% kitchen fee.  Fine. But to me that\u2019s a tip and part of the 20% I would normally leave. If they want to give part of my tip legally to the kitchen then fine - I factor that in. And their suggested tip on the bill includes both the tax. AND the kitchen fee?  Really?   That\u2019s double tipping. No way. To be fair they do state that the tip amounts are after tax based. But this is wrong. First time here today and it will definitely not be the last. Such a great space to have brunch as their vibe and aesthetic feel is on point. Sat in the back, in their little green house section, absolutely loved it. Had some drinks and delicious meals that were absolutely, melt in your mouth good. I highly recommend the duck confit hash & also their steak and eggs. For my sides I had fruit and they were definitely fresh as you could taste it; they were not from a can but cut. A little pricey (depending on what you order) but in all honesty it's all well worth it because you cannot beat the high quality of the food. Also, loved our waitress this morning. She was so sweet and very accommodating; also had great suggestions to help with final orders. Will definitely be back soon! Went here for lunch during a Boston weekend trip and it was such a cute restaurant. Saw on an Instagram reel they have a cute greenhouse seating and we asked to sit there. Food was delicious! Ordered the escargot toast (very yummy) and my friend and I shared the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, while she got a salad. Good soup, well-plated entrees, and charming desserts in a quaint setting. While it may not convert non-enthusiasts, it's a delightful spot with delicious food, excellent service, and a nice location.\n\nExtended Review:\nNestled in a cozy locale, Frenchie is a delightful dining experience with its good soup, well-prepared entrees, and charming desserts. While it may not be the type of restaurant to convert those who are not keen on this style of establishment, it certainly has its own distinct charm that makes it worth a visit.\n\nDuring my recent visit with a party of four, we were all impressed by the quality of the food and the attention to detail in its presentation. The desserts, in particular, stood out for their balance of sweetness without being overly gaudy. We opted for two selections that we doubled up on to enjoy a variety, and both were excellent choices. The chocolate sprinkled on the pastry was a nice touch, and the creme brulee had a perfect crumbly texture.\n\nThe main courses were equally impressive, with the pastas cooked to perfection and the proteins juicy and flavorful. Each dish was plated with care, showcasing the chef's skill and attention to detail. The service was also commendable, with attentive staff ensuring that our dining experience was pleasant from start to finish.\n\nThe restaurant's location added to the overall appeal, providing a nice backdrop for our meal. While Frenchie may not be a place that will win over those who are not fans of this style of dining, for those who appreciate good food, excellent service, and a charming atmosphere, it's definitely worth a visit.\n\n---\n\nYou can find me on Insta: @imdanielyoon In summary I would give this place a miss. The food is barely edible, and the presentation looks like college cafeteria slop. If you want more details read on. There are far better French-style restaurants all over town.\nHere's the scoop!\nTwo of us, we wanted to try the place out. We are French so very familiar with French-style cuisine\nArrived at 6:00 PM\nAppetizers:\nBrussel spouts, and steak Tartare: Brussel sprouts were baked, charred, good flavor and texture but lacked any appreciable sauce.\nThe Tartare arrived looking GREY, with a cracked qual egg, and a few very sad-looking potato chips out of a bag on the side. We had serious doubt about the meat freshness. It was a collection of large strips of raw meat, again not red; gray! Meat was very chewy and lacked any flavor. We asked for bread with the meat. \"Sorry\", the said \"we ran out of baguette\" The brought over a couple of slices of toast. Again we arrived at 6:00 PM, first customers there, and they ran out of bread. Theres a bakery around the corner, perhaps pick some up???\nOk main event:\nWe ordered the Duck Magret, 1/2 boneless chicken, and a side of ratatouille.\nThis was arguably the worst duck I've ever been served. It was tasteless and chewy, and presentation sad. It was served on veggies that had too much moisture. About a minute after the plate arrived the water from the veggies was all over the plate like a runny tasteless soup.\nThe chicken was slightly overcooked, had no flavor whatsoever. Also lots of runny water from the vegetables making the plate look soupy and gross.\nThe  ratatouille was a collection of stacked eggplant slices, tomato slices, and squash slices in a tasteless pink soupy liquid. Again no flavor.\nThere was good entertainment though. While sitting at the back section of the restaurant overlooking the back garden, the front cover of the air conditioning unit fell on the table underneath it, smashing the glasses on the table, sending glass all over. Fortunately, nobody was sitting at that table.\nSo all in all, I would call this experiment a big fail. Will not go there again!

Original Greek food all prepared very welll and with top ingredients. Impressive. Tsipouro drink really good. Excellent service reasonable\nprices. Oh my gosh! What a wonderful dining experience! We couldn\u2019t get into a Spanish restaurant on a Friday night, and randomly found Metropolis. Of course, we did not have a reservation, but the host was very kind. They took time and looked into their booking system, checking in with other staff and made us feel welcomed. They were accommodating and sat us at a bar. The bartender knew their drinks and food well. They were also very attentive to their guests\u2019 needs. We enjoyed our food very much as they were fresh and tasty. Couldn\u2019t have asked for a better meal on our last night in Boston! Highly recommended!!! Cocktail was phenomenal, chicken risotto was excellent (why isn't there more chicken in risottos?) and it was all served very quickly. Very glad I stopped in here to dine at the bar. Good for brunch! I had the Smoke Salmon Eggs Benedict here and really was satisfied with it. The poach egg was perfectly cooked with great Hollandaise sauce, very creamy and went well with the toasted buns. Needed to wait for a bit too long, but it was busy hour so it was understandable. I was wandering around the streets after dinner with the biggest peach cobbler craving. We stumbled in here and of course they had it. ATE. 10/10. Our waiter Mikey was a joy. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe Small, intimate atmosphere. Came here for brunch got the huevos rancheros with a buttermilk pancake. Everything was excellent. Service was fast, approachable. Food was well seasoned. Comfort Mediterranean food!\nWe were looking for all plant based options and then we found it, it was such an amazing experience. Food was so comforting.\nAmbience was good, they even had a display of all the spices and grains at the front. Staff were amazing and knowledgeable, they answered all our questions.\nTheir hummus was amazing, I have never tasted such an amazing humus! Bowl was warm and delicious. We loved our food!\nVibe of the place was good. Amazing place and comfy food. The hummus was outstanding and fresh. There were multiple flavors in the hot grain bowl we ordered and they were all amazing. If you\u2019re in the mood for delicious Mediterranean food that\u2019s both flavorful and light, Anoush\u2019ella is the perfect spot.\n\nBowl/Panini: The food here is fantastic\u2014packed with Mediterranean flavors, but not too oily or deep-fried. The dishes are satisfying without making you feel heavy, so you genuinely feel healthy while eating. It\u2019s the kind of meal that leaves you feeling good, not sluggish.\n\nLabneh: The labneh is an absolute standout\u2014creamy, tangy, and perfectly balanced. It\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve had, and I highly recommend trying it. It\u2019s a real treat that adds something special to the whole meal.\n\nService: The service was top-notch. The staff were attentive, knowledgeable, and answered all our questions. They were really helpful in suggesting the right items, making our experience even better.\n\nAmbience: The ambience is charming, with a cute cafe vibe. The setting is unique, offering a cozy, relaxed atmosphere that\u2019s perfect for enjoying a meal. It\u2019s a comfortable space where you can sit back and savor your food.\n\nOverall, Anoush\u2019ella offers a wonderful dining experience with great food, attentive service, and a welcoming vibe. Definitely worth checking out! The food is delicious, affordable, healthy, and refreshing. There's a calm atmosphere and beautiful furniture.. I brought my girlfriend here expecting tasty but greasy food, and instead we were left feeling refreshed and happy with every craving satisfied. Food was delicious, but service was a bit weird. I had initially expected a sit down restaurant, but the seating is more like a CAVA or chipotle style of dine in experience. The Chef Mezze platter is a great introduction to Armenian cuisine, and the rice pudding is a must try! This place offers high quality coffee and food! We had a delicious egg sandwich. French toast had an unique flavor. We also tried cheese cake and chocolate chips. Everything fresh and made with care,  high recommended! The place can get busy over the weekend. Grabbed desserts with friends as I had heard good things about the place. Learned today that they served more brunch/lunch menus than actual dessert. It was mostly confectionery than drinks or cold (eg frap or ice cream). Found them a little sweet for me. The server was polite and efficient. Inside was clean and very crowded. It was almost Impossible to find seats even on the stands near the window/wall. Seemed like a very popular place. I personally found it noisy and not as easy to talk. They had water taps with cups for free water which was accessible. I appreciated that a lot. Very pleasantly surprised by how delicious the sweet potato sandwich was!\n\nFlour is known for having solid pastries, so I initially was worried getting a vegetarian sandwich, but they blew me away! The goat cheese and apple worked so well with the sweet potato, especially with bitter arugula to break it up, I devoted it so fast I could barely take a photo. Highly recommend and will be getting again! Good food and nice place to hangout. Free WiFi. Clean and big windows for natural light. Use the app and refer a friend for 10% off. Quiche is so good. Food was delicious (gluten free orange poppy seeds muffin and cauliflower melt) and staff was friendly.\nIf the management sees this, please consider switching the plastic cups to paper cups for self-serve water. It will be as good and less damaging to environment. I take my  toddler son here r saturday morning play  me/story time. It is very nice, very friendly and helpful staff and really interactive activities done by teachers. This is place is amazing! It's a welcoming place with home friendly atmosphere I love it looking forward to be there again. Great place for the community. Salsa in the Park on summer nights is an absolute blast \ud83d\ude4c Friendly staff that care about the kids. Always great to see Several activities for kids and adults. I use the fitness and the pool. It is really good."

    "reviews": "I\u2019ve been with the \u201cBarber Magnate\u201d Anthony since 2012-well before Skip\u2019s opened up.  I\u2019ve been with my barber Paolo since ~2016 (shortly after Anthony went to Skip\u2019s south end and P stayed in Southie for a period of time) and when P went to the South End, I had to follow.  For me, the barber chair is my \u201cspa\u201d and place of solace and once you get a barber that you like-don\u2019t give him/her up for anything!  I\u2019m at Skip\u2019s once a month religiously.  The service is top notch, it\u2019s old school barbershop family time.  Don\u2019t sleep on Skip\u2019s but make an appointment!!   Shave and a haircut every time I walk out of there feeling like a new man!! I\u2019m new to Boston and was looking for a Skull/skin tight fade and Marc Jacob did an amazing job. Welcoming environment, coming back for sure ! 10/10. Best cut I\u2019ve had in a long while; great people  too. Roberto was on point with the scissors and the conversation. I have long, difficult hair, and it was (or at least appeared to be) a breeze for him. Will be back. Great service.  On my first visit, I brought a picture of my last haircut from a barber that I was very happy with and been cutting my hair for a couple of years.  Roberto studied the picture and asked a few questions and then cut my hair better than my previous barber.  I was extremely happy with the cut and he's cut it 3 more times since and it continues to get better.  The shop is also a great barber shop with good guys working there.  It has an old school barber vibe and lots of good conversation going on, I highly recommend! Don\u2019t sleep on these boys, excellent haircut every time I go. These guys are professionals and take their craft and careers seriously. They listen to you and deliver every time. Atmosphere and vibe in the shop is correct. Paolo is detail oriented and takes his time to get it right. I won\u2019t be seeing any other barber in the Boston area if Paolo is cutting, Facts. Great little store. Love it Tons of lines to select from, and they even gave us a tasting. Super knowledgeable staff. The Wine Emporium is fantastic! The wine specialist is an absolute encyclopedia of knowledge\u2014she found exactly what I\u2019d been searching for but couldn\u2019t find anywhere else. I emailed her last week about a special order, and she made it happen seamlessly. Very helpful staff all around. Highly recommend! Nice nice people, but inconvenient hours and INCREDIBLY overpriced - reds are 50%+ more than at Whole Foods or other liquor stores (60% more than usual total wine). Happy to support local businesses over national chains, but this is simply price gouging. Honestly they every type of Wine in the world \ud83c\udf0d they are well stocked I definitely recommend buying your wine from there they will definitely have it whatever wine you are looking for you should be able to find it there I guarantee you can find it there the selection is endless!! Boston\u2019s largest wine cellar. Incredible selection. Jenn, the manager and wine buyer, is so knowledgeable and kind. I don\u2019t trust anyone else to suggest wine for me. Every suggestion of hers is pure gold. Won\u2019t shop for wine anywhere else in the city \ud83d\udc95 The Wine Emporium is a true gem for wine enthusiasts and novices alike. From the moment you step in, the ambiance exudes elegance and warmth, setting the perfect tone for a delightful experience. Their curated selection of wines from around the world is impressive, ensuring there's something for every palate and occasion. The knowledgeable staff members are passionate and always ready to guide you with personalized recommendations. Whether you're seeking a rare vintage or a daily sipper, The Wine Emporium's commitment to quality and customer service shines through. Each visit is an enriching journey through the world of wines, making it a must-visit destination for any wine lover. The selection here is truly incredible. They have multiple bottles of difficult to find whiskey favorites like Hibiki and Yamazaki 12 Year.\n\nStaff is knowledgeable and on point. Haven't been in the area for too long,  but The Wine Emporium is my current go to.  They are a little pricey when it comes to wine and spirits but what they miss out in price they make up for in information. They didn't try to oversell, in fact the contrary and Vu helped me choose some great spirits and canned cocktails. We love this shop!  They\u2019re so helpful and knowledgeable- feels like such a perfect neighborhood spot in a busy city. Always friendly and our dog loves the treats \u263a\ufe0f Do not shop here unless you are trying to infect yourself with Covid-19.  Clueless employees. New ones every day. No effort to sanitize shop. No masks. High prices. Used to be a good shop. New owners could not care a bit about the neighborhood. The city should shut it down until they clean up their act. We\u2019ve tried lots of pizza and this place has our favorite pizza in the city! My kids and I are regulars and Monica always takes care of us and knows exactly what we like! Upper Crust is our go to place for pizza. The crust, tomato sauce, and cheese are all fantastic! Monica from Upper Crust on Tremont St always helps me with my big orders and all dietary restrictions! She is incredible at making sure our orders are correct and food is delivered in a timely manner. We always go to Upper Crust based on the great service from Monica and her team! Monica was so sweet! Will be back to see this wonderful young lady, we need more people like her, she helped me and my family out! Very clean workplace, great food & nice staff! Keep up the good work! Online ordering is a breeze! They've been on time with their estimates for multiple visits, and my pizza is always still piping hot by the time I get home. One of my favorite spots for a not so basic pizza. Great variety, looking forward to trying them all! Their calzones are also excellent. This pizzeria was highly recommended by a local.  I visited them and  I was delighted with the taste of the pizzas.  As I walked in, I noticed they have pizzas by slices and I ordered the regular cheese.  It was delicious! The customer service is as outstanding as the tasty pizza.  We decided to dine in and the server took the the pizzas to our table.  They have all seasoning:  olive oil, red pepper, oregano, and pecorino cheese.\n\nThey have a washroom on premises.  Paid parking is outside in the street . Loved the ambience of Aquitaine. Our server was able to recommend some wines for us to try before deciding which bottle to get. The escargot was the highlights of my meal. The duck breast was also very good. Chocolate chip bread pudding was to die for. The experience at Aquitaine is always top notch. The servers are extremely attentive and professional. The food is simple, delicious, and high quality. I\u2019ve been twice for dinner and will be back for brunch! Beautiful seating and ambience. Great for lunch and dinner. The service and food was excellent.\nThe bacon arrived a little overcooked and they replaced it immediately.\n\nThe croque Madame was very filling. Too heavy for me.\n\nWe prefer the malted Belgian waffle and french toast. Amazing waiting staff by a lovely lady with a Frida Kahlo mask\n\nThey missed to mention it was restaurant week as I would have adjusted my choices\nI had to find out in the restroom\nI personally did not appreciate the clubby music for a restaurant with fine dining\n\nSteak au poivre market price was $80\nI also like their county pate from before better than the creamy pate they had now\n\nLastly I ordered a side of fries and it was a small bowl with unfortunately only short  (1 cm) long fries\n\nLastly I would expect a more real chocolate sauce on the profiteroles We enjoyed a fabulous experience and meal at Aquitaine. We had exceptional service from our server, Julianna, and the entire staff.  Our duck and steak were cooked exactly to our liking. Their escargot is on point and the profiteroles were a delicious ending to our meal. All of the food was flavorful and served in a timely manner. Not to mention, they offered a very reasonable and solid bottle of bordeaux.  After all these years, Aquitaine does not disappoint. Highly recommended. Loved the ambience of Aquitaine.

Small with a limit selection of beers on tap. You can order food from the Tremont 647 restaurant. Bartenders are friendly and the music is good. Bar side can be quite fun. Some apps good, others tend to be overdressed. Cornbread is amazing, as is the rice and beans.\nTaco Tuesday is a great find. Much like people born into wealth each employee is reliving their ideal high school experience while expecting the customers to buy into this fantasy (it's an ugly story that ends with a bartender's daughter growing up to become a stripper. This and it's sister restaurant next door can be summed up in 1 sentence: high school with (depending on what you order) slightly better food. If you're shallow this is the ideal eating and drinking spot for you. The fish tacos, pulled pork tacos, and chicken tacos was generously flavored and delightfuly satisfying. Very good price and atmosphere. Will definitely visit this place again. Great neighborhood hang out . Not pretensions made us feel very comfortable\nGreat value , music and the revolving local art was awesome"

Thank you so much. Keep being so awesome.  It is very much appreciated. Yesterday, I had to be rushed to the ER for kidney stones. I\u2019m in severe pain and reached out to my pcp for pain meds. No one had the decency to return my call today. I called 3 times, and through crippling pain had to provide the same information multiple times. This is not compassionate care. I\u2019m extremely disappointed in their lack of professionalism. They didn\u2019t even have the decency to simply provide a yes or no. Now I must go through the weekend without pain meds, and will possibly have to pay another fee to see urgent care. I've been a patient of HV for several years now and I wanted to take a moment to thank the staff for being so wonderful! A special shout out to the pharmacy. For a while now I've been seeing two pharmacists working in the pharmacy. An African-American woman and an Asian man and these two work really hard. Always very pleasant and on the ball \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb The staff at this place are phenomenal. Front-desk, medical assistants, phebotomy & X-ray techs, pharmacy team, and physicians/NPs - they are all courteous, helpful, and make me feel welcome and listened to. Best patient experience I've ever had. I have never felt so comfortable & cared for at a medical facility. Every staff member is kind and invested in you, even those at the front desk! The central Boston location is phenomenal and I\u2019m always able to easily make an appointment when I need one. Highly recommend Dr. Kate Durgin in the OB/ Gynecology department- she\u2019s wonderful and comfortable! Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. When you first enter, this seems like a smaller CVS until you realize there's a second floor. Overall good service but the store does feel a bit messy. I still don't know why they lock up some of their items. Just get better security instead of making the honest people wait around for someone to unlock the shaving cream. I was very sad today to witness a black male being racially profiled by the cashier managing the self check out section, at around 2 pm today. He asked her if they had soap containers, she told him to pay 1st & then she would help him find the soap container, she then accused him of attempting to steal when everyone there could clearly see that he wanted to buy the soap container & everything else he planned to purchase all at once.\n\nWhen the individual walked in the store, he was followed. I could hear the cashier telling the guy, \"I know what you are trying to do\". The guy replied, \" I have no idea what you are talking about\". In the end, he paid for all his items & politely thanked her even though she was extremely rude to him. I've seen this employee smoking cigarettes by the front entrance on multiple occasions so I recognized her. She is a brunette, looks like she is in her 50's, or 60's. This was very sad to watch, I really hope this review will prevent this from happening to other customers in the future. I wish there was a way to give 0 stars. Great CVS! The store itself was standard, but the staff was nice, especially Rita. Welcoming experience and I was able to get what I needed quickly! TERRIBLE customer service upstairs. We went to get passport photos done. There was 2 employees and no customers and despite us asking for help both continued doing what they were doing. Once someone finally stopped to assist us, she couldn\u2019t even tell us the pricing. We walked back out. What a great pharmacy.  I needed a prescription filled pronto and the urgent care was next door.  They were able to process my prescription within 20 minutes and Rubi was super nice The store is good and I was able to get the items I needed. My comment is about a female employee.  Last Thursday I was in the store and she passed by me walking very fast, nearly bumping into me.  As I approached the self checkout once again she passed in front of me very quickly.  She should have said excuse me or I need to pass by.  She has done this several times when I was shopping there. Learn some manners! My dad was at the CVS pharmacy. He was originally served by a young guy who I believe is a new employee but afterwards, a Chinese lady named Karen (not sure if I spelled her name right), the other pharmacist co-worker, came over. My dad asked her how long the wait time will be because of his leg problems he can\u2019t stand for long periods of time. Karen said to my dad if you can\u2019t wait then you can go to somewhere else and she\u2019s the one who\u2019s in charge at the pharmacy. My mom heard what she said to my dad and was obviously very upset because is that how the pharmacist treat the elderly!? My mom was trying to argue with Karen, but Karen refused to fill the prescriptions for my dad. Does the pharmacist have the power to refuse to fill my dad\u2019s prescriptions just because of his medical disability of not being able to stand for a long time!? What happened if my dad\u2019s condition becomes life threatening because Karen refused to fill my dad\u2019s prescriptions that he needs to take on a daily basis? Will she be responding to this review? DO NOT GO HERE! Never has my medication on time. SEVERAL TIMES IN A ROW!! God forbid you have a life threatening situation\u2014 i hope your medication isn\u2019t at this cvs. They are inconsistent and rude\u2026 why would you order a medication the day AFTER it was supposed to be filled, then blame the customer!  WOULD GIVE A 0 STAR IF I COULD. Everything is all locked up and they make someone unlock everything\u2026 makes you feel like a criminal. I to CVS a the time back at home to buy essential items.  But this CVS has something that I have never seen before and that is most of the items are locked up behind glass making it hard to read ingredient lists and to compare products.\n\nI assume this CVS must have a problem with theft as I could think of no other reason to lock things up.  But I asked and the cashier said that was the case.  So sad that a tourist arae like this has a bad problem like theft.\n\nAnyway I purchased one item I needed and will wait until I get home to stock up on other essentials. My daughter went to pick up an antibiotic after a strep positive throat culture at urgent care, was told by the tech \u201cthe pharmacy closes in 5 minutes you\u2019ll have to come back tomorrow\u201d We were on the way to the airport when we noticed this store. I called to check if there was anyone inside to let us in because regular open hours didn't work for us. Special thanks to Yasha for accommodating our request. We got all our questions answered by a true expert. \ud83d\udc4d I got the best deal, what a great store.  Terri  was so kind and honest, helped me get just what i needed.  The staff work well together to make you feel valued. The couches were delivered the next day, at the time we agreed. Beautiful & unique furniture, great staff.  Looking forward to buying more. Highly recommend. We bought our couch from Europe Today and we love it!! Terry was extremely helpful in helping us pick it out, and making sure it would go with the rest of our living room. It was delivered on our move in day as promised! The delivery guys went above and beyond to fit the couch up our tiny staircase. Definitely recommend Europe Today to anyone buying furniture in the Brighton area! Although the site forces me to give one star, I actually give this place zero stars.  I purchased 6 dining chairs in January 2017, and as of today April 6, 2017 and I still have not received the chairs nor a refund.  If the business cannot supply the furniture, then they should at the very least supply a refund.  Instead they took my money and didn't provide anything in return.  I have the paid receipt from my purchase.  When I try to check on the status of my order via phone or email, I don't get a call back nor an email response.  Terri keeps giving me excuses as to why the owner hasn't called me back yet, but the excuses have gotten old after months of not getting a response. Based on my experience, I don't recommend buying anything from Europe Today Furniture.  You're money will simply go into a black hole. Amazing modern furniture for amazing prices! Perfect modern furniture for smaller spaces. Staff is wonderful as well. Terri and Oleg are great! Terri helps you pick furniture as if she was a personal design consultant.  Came in for a coffee table and left with a full living room set that all matches beautifully and is so unique. Will be buying from them again! Highly recommended I have a few IRAs that I have opened over the years, distributed around to different banks. I had one at Eastern Bank, which I lost track of after I moved out of Massachusetts. I recently tried to deal with this, with no idea of the incredible frustration that would ensue.\n\nI had to visit the branch in person, because their validation system over the phone didn't take into account the possibility that a customer might have updated their ID since opening an account. The people involved were friendly and tried to be helpful, but I was given a lot of incorrect info, and in the end it took weeks, and multiple visits and emails, to resolve the issue. The account had been losing money due to high fees, and ultimately, when I was finally able to close it, they wanted to charge a $50 \"liquidation fee\" on top of all the money the account had lost. I'd never had this happen anywhere else.\n\nI'm not sure what customer base Eastern Bank serves. They are certainly doing their best to be helpful and welcoming in the branches, but the policies and incredibly high fees make it a losing proposition to bank here. I think that almost any alternative, whether a credit union or a brokerage, would be preferable. Staff are very nice and helpful but be warned, the Eastern ATM machines are not at all reliable. Twice now the ATMS have straight up stolen my money, taking in large cash deposits then issuing an error code and not depositing the money nor giving it back. Took 10 days (7 business days) after I issued a report to finally get my money back. Today I warily tried to deposit cash again and the machine counted my money wrong, undercounting it by $10, so I just canceled the transaction. It\u2019s not worth it to lose your money, don\u2019t repeat my mistakes and just wait until the banks open. Crazy that ATMs can\u2019t be trusted to do ATM things This is not a reputable bank. They nickel and dime you at every opportunity - including charging a $1.50 fee for EVERY loan payment made.\n\nThey provide NO options to avoid this theft beyond going into a branch itself. I have a relationship with Bank of America, Amex banking, Chase, Citi, Citizens, Santander, and MIT Federal Credit Union and NONE of them charge a fee for making a payment.\n\nEven worse, they don't even own their own ACH platform. It's a 3rd party running that for them. So, no only are you giving your most sensitive information to a 3rd party vendor you have no contact with, you're actually paying Eastern Bank to send it to them.\n\nThe early 1900's called, and they want their bank back. In this day and age charging fees to BE PAID is absolutely and all the way absurd.\n\nMy recommendation is to do business with any bank over Eastern. A quick look at their rube executive team online with their cheap suits and poor hair will tell you all you need to know.\n\nAvoid at all cost. This review is long overdue so I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s taken me this long to write it. I always have a pleasant experience at this branch of Eastern Bank. On one particular occasion, my (new) husband and I came in to change my name on all of our accounts to my married name, add my name to an account which was previously just my husband\u2019s, along with depositing money and getting new bank cards printed for our multiple accounts with my new name. It was a long tedious to do list! The Operations Associate, Christopher, took all of these tasks on with a smile! He was so kind and friendly (even recommended a good place to grab breakfast sandwiches). He had to have spent at least 30 minutes to an hour helping us and was patient and helpful the entire time! I\u2019m sorry this review took so long to get written, but I wanted to make sure he gets the recognition he deserves because he\u2019s an all star employee! I wish all bank associates could be as friendly, helpful, and outgoing as he was! Thanks Christopher!! The Back Bay Branch of Eastern is excellent.  Great Manager and Great Associates. They are always well stocked. However, the staff is condensing, murmurs microagressions, doesn't ask if you have questions about your medication and oftentimes doesn't meet deadlines on when they claim prescriptions will be ready. The culture is incredibly stoic with an unapproachable staff who demonstrate no bedside manner with customers. This Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy has been holding my 3 month old daughter's prescription hostage. They left a generic message for me telling me I needed to call them back about the prescription. I tried calling back and was on hold for over an hour before I gave up. The hospital (where my daughter was seen for this prescription) pharmacy then attempted to fill the prescription since I was getting nowhere with Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy. The couldn't refill it because Walgreens already run the prescription through my insurance. The hospital pharmacy tried calling Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy to cancel the prescription and they also couldn't get anyone on the phone. I called my local Walgreens who tried to help and they ALSO couldn't get anyone on the phone. I now have to drive an hour to and an hour back from the hospital just to get a sample of the medication for my infant because Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy can't answer their phones. TAKE YOUR SPECIALTY PRESCRIPTIONS ELSEWHERE! This used to be one of the best pharmacies around now. I've already tried to call a few times over a 30-minute wait both times and still not able to get through through the name changed and so did their service. Unfortunately not for the better This place told me I could let the pharmacist fill me prescriptions automatically when they were due! I have nine prescriptions every month and in the last six months, none of my prescriptions have ever been filled! Like who woulda known! I literally have no choice but to order my sons medications here, he has a pulmonary disease and this is the pharmacy that insurance will cover for delivery\u2019s and i have to sit on hold for 45mins to an hour just to speak to someone to fill his scrips because if I do it online it never comes through correctly, it\u2019s ridiculous that y\u2019all don\u2019t have anyone to answer a simple phone call and that I have to wait 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR just to speak to a tech If I could give this wine store and the entire staff a million stars I would. We recently hosted my friends bachelorette here at this incredible establishment and I was blown away by the support, kindness, and professionalism Urban Grape displayed from the moment I reached out to the actual night of. The overall team and event organizer (Brittany!!) were the best to work with throughout the whole process and helped to make the night oh so special. Above the impeccable customer service, the catered food and detailed (&customized!) wine tasting menu were out of this world and our bride to be (&all of our dear friends) are still talking about how wonderful it was. Thank you to the entire team at Urban Grape for making our night so memorable! You are the absolute best and cannot wait to come back!! The Urban Grape isn\u2019t just a wine shop\u2014it\u2019s a community, a family, and a place that truly changed my life. I first walked in as a customer, drawn in by the incredible selection and welcoming vibe, and I kept coming back because every visit felt like a new adventure. The staff always took the time to share their knowledge, recommend the perfect bottle, and make wine feel approachable, no matter your experience level.\n\nThat passion and warmth inspired me so much that I eventually joined the team\u2014and spent over two incredible years learning, growing, and falling even more in love with wine. Working at UG showed me firsthand just how special this place is. The progressive scale system makes choosing wine easy and fun, but more than that, the people here create an environment that feels truly welcoming to everyone.\n\nSadly, I\u2019m moving and have to say goodbye, and leaving is bittersweet. The Urban Grape has been such a huge part of my life, and I\u2019ll always be grateful for the memories, the friendships, and the incredible wines I discovered along the way.\n\nIf you love wine, this is the place to be. You won\u2019t just find a great bottle\u2014you\u2019ll find a place that feels like home. UG, I\u2019ll miss you more than words can say! I was extremely excited to come and explore the store. Chip,  greeted my sister and we shared that this was our first visit to the store. he gave us an amazing experience! I must say he wasn\u2019t the first person to great us and we were so glad he stop us from leaving ! He truly turned our experience around and quickly. he explained the how the store was set up and even educated us on a lot of wines. he also recommended a lot of wines (I purchased one)  He even got me signed up to receive weekly newsletters from the store.  I also spoke with Emily and she informed me about the special Tuesdays, let\u2019s just say I can not wait to come back. I\u2019m excited to be apart of The Urban Grape Community.\n\nMy favorite part of this visit was the staff weekly pick. How amazing is that! The owners value their employees opinions.  It\u2019s also the perfect pitstop in the store for when you just don\u2019t know what to try next! Recently worked with The Urban Grape team for a corporate networking event and had a fantastic experience! Not only did Brittany have a great handle on all aspects of our event but she has a great relationship with another local vendor (Boardeaux) that streamlined our vendor management tenfold! Everything from our first meeting, thoughtful wine selections, through to day of execution was wonderful! I also have to highlight Alyssa who was our wine educator for the event and received great praise from our attendees. Thank you UG team and hope to work with you all again in the future! Socially conscious and highly delicious. Best part of the experience here? The staff. Highly knowledgeable, personable, kind and helpful! Learning about the progressive drinking scale is a treat and the selection is insane. Everything is intentional, from the lighting fixtures to the counters. Big bonus: you can order online and they deliver on the Boston area! Can\u2019t miss here, and can\u2019t wait to go back again. Ordered flower delivery for my mom's birthday today and the flowers are stunning! She's been raving about the beautiful bouquet (designer's choice) all afternoon and she posted a picture on Facebook and all her friends are commenting how gorgeous the bright blooms are. Will definitely order from this shop again - they nailed it! What a wonderful floral shop.  Thanks for being open when others are closed for the holidays.  Thanks for the call back to make sure you understood my floral request.  Thanks to the great delivery driver who took a picture of the arrangement at the point of delivery.  Thanks for this stunning floral arrangement.  It made my sister's day.  You are beautiful!!!!!! We ordered the designer choice flowers for our friends white coat. Fresco flowers was extremely accommodating and used colors of our friends school and preferences. Can't recommend them enough! The arrangement was beautiful! There was a little hiccup with the order. Fresco was wonderful about being in touch and went behind expectation stop try and remedy/make-up for the issue. Their flowers and service are great! I will be ordering from them again for sure. It pays to shop local and get that personal service. Can't say enough about this place!! Same quality as Winston Flowers for half the price. I use Frescos regularly to send my fianc\u00e9e flowers and she's blown away every time. The evil wrought this entity haunted me for a dozen years. Back in 2012, I defaulted on my loans. I went through the rehabilitation program which was being outsourced and the outsourced third party promised me the moon should I actually complete the rehabilitation program. That included reversal of fees and penalties and so forth. At great personal sacrifice at the time, I completed the program successfully and my loans are rehabilitated. It appears I was lied to about the reversal of penalties and fines regarding the default. Though the details are rather hazy 12 years on, I know this organization was involved and they did nothing and the person I contacted sounded like an aggrieved victim who enjoyed getting back at College grads. It was disgusting and it made me think that not only should the death penalty be brought back, but it should be brought back and applied to people who made me false promises that adversely affected my life. The funny thing is, and this has propelled me to write this review, it didn't matter in the end. I became smart and negotiated things to such an extent that I never had to make another loan payment until they were written off recently! I do have the email exchanges and records of the telephone conversations of 12 years ago. Not sure if they're still working for the organization, I haven't checked, but I hope they rot in hell and all for nothing. Their abuse of power was an exercise in futility in the end We need to put this place out of business. I ended up having to pay an additional $980 on top of the principal I had. They don't communicate with you - they said that they do not email, and I received none of the hardcopy letters that they claim to have mailed. So, for 6 months, I had no idea that they had taken on some of my loans and I ended up with a letter from a collection agency, stating that I had defaulted on the loan by not paying for 6 months. My loans used to all show up on my Navient account page, but after ASA took over the loan, the balance showed up on Navient as \"$0 due\", which made it seem like they've entered the forbearance period that I had also applied for. Apparently, such was not the case, and instead of having all of my loans show up on Navient as they had been, they were now on a different account/website that nobody told me anything about. So, because of ASA, not only am I in default with a lowered credit score, I actually owe a $1,000 extra than had I not fallen for their scam. ASA and debt collection agency both get money at the expense of a college student. I came here because their company's consultants said that they can give us guidance about go to college. they were very sincere at that time, I also thought they unconditionally wanted to help us. The company is in downtown Boston's library, Where it is difficult to find parking spaces, the subway is quite backward, my place of residence is far from the city center, and I am usually  very busy. Then I thought This is for my future, so it\u2019s worth to go. Finally, I found  a Free day, I spent about 45 minutes to drive there and found an underground parking near their company, spent 38 US dollars parking fee, finally find a hard to find subway station, and finally Arrived in the library, and turned a big circle to find their company.They are good service attitude, but I feel they did not give me any valuable information, the only one sort of have a little bit of value information he said he would email me right away. The whole process did not take more than 15 minutes. After I got home and saw the email they sent me. At that time, I felt they had fooled me and did not know what the reason was. My all day was wasted. The worst student loan servicer to have a working relationship with, so I decided to consolidate. I went here today to get a problem resolved. I bought a monthly pass several days ago and mistakenly bought it for the wrong month. I wanted it exchanged and loaded with the same value. The person at the reception was very kind and resolved my concern even though I was several days late with my complaint. The process was smooth and quick. Four stars because their online resolution system is poor and I had to set aside several hours to visit the office in person. Very helpful at this store,  but the mbta needs to update the location and signs etc in downtown station because it still says the store is underground Quick and prompt service. Very happy with outcome for transferring stored value from expired Charlie Cards to new replacement cards. Very helpful, fast service. Kind employees.\nTransferring my credit to a new card was free and fast. Less than a minute!\nThere is no fee. Not sure what that other one star review was about. Don't trust the MBTA CharlieCard! I have two CharlieCards that worked fine last year. This spring they suddenly stopped working. I checked with MBTA customer service and was told that the cards had a $0 balance. This was totally untrue. I then checked with another source and confirmed that there was a balance of over $10 but it was expired. This is ridiculous because the cards have \"Expiration Date: 6/20/2028\" printed on them. How could MBTA let them expire more than 4 years in advance! One of my cards is a Senior CharlieCard and I can renew the card online. MBTA posted that \"If you renew current or expired [senior] card, your balance from your old card will be automatically transferred to your new card.\" However, when I received the new senior card, it had $0.00 transferred into it. So, the CharlieCard issuer has fooled me (the customer) at least three times in a short period of time (card expired 4 years before the printed date; told me the balance was $0; claimed the balance could be transferred when it actually couldn't). The CharlieCard is a transportation debit card. When customers made a deposit into their bank accounts, no bank dares to wipe the money off for no reason. However, the CharlieCard issuer dares to do such illegal things. Amtrak Ticket Office Review\nRating: 3.5/5\nI recently visited the Amtrak ticket office, and while the building itself could use some renovation \u2013 it's a bit old and rundown \u2013 the service I received was top-notch. The staff were friendly, helpful, and pleasant, making the experience much more enjoyable than the surroundings might have suggested.\n\nService\nThe staff were knowledgeable and efficient, answering all my questions and helping me with my ticket. They were patient and courteous, making sure I had everything I needed for my trip.\n\nAmbiance\nAs mentioned, the building could use some updates. It's clear that it's been a while since the facility has seen some renovation. However, despite the dated surroundings, the staff did their best to make the experience welcoming.\n\nOverall Experience\nWhile the Amtrak ticket office may not be the most modern or visually appealing, the excellent service and friendly staff made up for it. If you're looking for a hassle-free and pleasant experience, this ticket office is a good choice. Just be prepared for a bit of a dated environment.\" My wife came from Wilmington, Delaware. Excellent to Washington DC. Perfect. When she come from Washington to Tampa it went from scale to 10 to 0. No help at all and it was on the boarding pass they needed to help my wife and they didn't at all the people from Tampa. That's why it's a zero in Tampa Wilmington Delaware. They got a 10 plus Washington DC. Get a 10 plus Tampa. Get a zero bad. Very bad Not bad but could use some TLC! Staff was friendly. My Amtrak experience at this location was mediocre. The train was late, and there was no information about the delay. Announcements were shouted, which was difficult for anyone who couldn't hear or understand clearly. I bought a round trip ticket, and both my trips were severely delayed. The evil wrought this entity haunted me for a dozen years. Back in 2012, I defaulted on my loans.

My all day was wasted. The worst student loan servicer to have a working relationship with, so I decided to consolidate. Stopped by for dinner after hearing great things about the place, and it definitely lived up to the hype. We kicked things off with a couple of drinks.\n\nFor the main course, I went with the Half Roasted Chicken. It came with a generous serving of perfectly seasoned greens and roasted potatoes. The chicken itself was flavorful, tender, and juicy. I also had a taste of my wife\u2019s Bucatini, and it was just as impressive. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce had a nice flavor.\n\nThe overall experience was fantastic, and the service was top-notch. The staff was friendly and attentive. Wowwwwwwww im so impressed!!! The pizza crust was perfectly cooked and everything was so amazing!!!!\nThe board was delicious as well i was continually digging it.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy and nice. Open kitchen concept so you get to see the doughs tossed around. They said they take Apple Pay but it failed when I tried to pay (like not even registering) so that was weird.\n\nThe food was awesome so will definitely be back for more! I highly recommend this place if you\u2019re around the area Excellent service and delicious food. If you are expecting spaghetti and meatballs, check them menu before dining. Delicious as always, smoked shallot marmalade is amazing.  Charcuterie board and pizzas, Salty Pig & Soppressata I loved the pizza we had in the Salty pig! The pizza tasted amazing. The amount of salt, crispy bread, cooked dressing and everything was fantastic. First time and definitely I will go back again. Great atmosphere and very good host and service. The food is tasty and relatively French authentic but delicious. Appetizers were good and a good size as well as the entries. This is a place where you leave and you are still hungry, portions are generous. I was expecting a little more choices for wine by the glass and actually better selection. Many options to select from the menu, and not the usual \u201cBoston menu\u201d finally. I came here with a friend of mine. The French onion soup is as good (if not better) than the ones I\u2019ve had in Paris. I got the duck and my friend ordered the lamb. Both were delicious. The profiteroles were absolutely delicious, paired with pistachio icecream and chocolate. Beautiful restaurant and super elegant ambience. Lamb chops were tender and juicy and the sauce complimented the lamb so well; prob best lamb chops I\u2019ve ever had. Beef tenderloin pizza was unique and crust was super thin and crunchy, which I liked. Truffle mac and cheese was also really unique with a really rich sauce. Overall really good food. Celebrating a birthday with a friend\u2026 Every dish is a work of art, but I will tell you the dessert was lemon tart with blood orange reduction\u2026 kudos to the pastry chef! The French onion soup was out of this world! The macaroni and cheese with truffle is a dining experience in and of itself! Service: 10/10 - My table was ready when I arrived, my coat was checked in and our waiter and servers were all so incredible. They even plated out to go containers for us \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAtmosphere: Went in the winter and it was warm and cozy. Loved the music, it was a mix of instrumentals, not loud and great for conversations.\n\nFood: the selection was incredible. The appetizer menu was incredible. I\u2019ll be back for more. We were going to split our entree as we were so full from just the appetizers and they plated it as a split.\n\nPrice: Impressed by the price. The appetizers were between $25-35, entree\u2019s were between $45-65, drinks were a bit pricy around $18. Dessert $16-18. They do not include tip automatically. Great place for lunch or dinner. We sat a window table. Very cozy. Loved the pictures on the wall. The Limoncello Spritz was a perfect lunch drink. Arancinis with the tomato sauce were delicious. Rigatoni sooo good. Pollo di limone was very delicious as well. I probably would have liked some more veggies or something else on that plate but regardless I would eat it again. Staff super friendly. This place is very popular, we had to wait 45 mins for a table (went without a reservation).\n\nThe rigatoni pasta was good. The cocktails were fine. Probably not the best decision to get a margarita in an Italian restaurant. But the vibes are great for a date night! Gigi delivers solid Italian food with perfectly al dente pasta and well-balanced sauces. The tuna tartare was just okay, but the Hugo Spritz was refreshing and well-made. Service was also great, making for an overall enjoyable experience! We made a reservation because we saw the tik toks that showcased amazing looking food. Literally it was just that! The pasta was fresh, the sauce was sweet and the staff is very nice. Great choice of red wines, where\u2019s the Cali wine tho? Overall, it was a great experience. The restaurant is chill vibes, good for a third date. The Caprese Salad was amazing, the tomatoes reminded me of the flavor of Sorrento (not as sweet like candy but still fresh and delicious) Matthew was incredible! The service at Gigi was professional, attentive, and kind. The food and service were outstanding, the atmosphere was perfect, and the music added to the ambiance. The restaurant\u2019s layout made for a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience. This was easily one of the top restaurants we visited in Boston, and we will definitely be returning This place offers high quality coffee and food! We had a delicious egg sandwich. French toast had an unique flavor. We also tried cheese cake and chocolate chips. Everything fresh and made with care,  high recommended! The place can get busy over the weekend. Grabbed desserts with friends as I had heard good things about the place. Learned today that they served more brunch/lunch menus than actual dessert. It was mostly confectionery than drinks or cold (eg frap or ice cream). Found them a little sweet for me. The server was polite and efficient. Inside was clean and very crowded. It was almost Impossible to find seats even on the stands near the window/wall. Seemed like a very popular place. I personally found it noisy and not as easy to talk. They had water taps with cups for free water which was accessible. I appreciated that a lot. Very pleasantly surprised by how delicious the sweet potato sandwich was!\n\nFlour is known for having solid pastries, so I initially was worried getting a vegetarian sandwich, but they blew me away! The goat cheese and apple worked so well with the sweet potato, especially with bitter arugula to break it up, I devoted it so fast I could barely take a photo. Highly recommend and will be getting again! Good food and nice place to hangout. Free WiFi. Clean and big windows for natural light. Use the app and refer a friend for 10% off. Quiche is so good. Food was delicious (gluten free orange poppy seeds muffin and cauliflower melt) and staff was friendly.\nIf the management sees this, please consider switching the plastic cups to paper cups for self-serve water. It will be as good and less damaging to environment. Dude!! I regret not getting that five dollar special on a Tuesday. We just popped in for a quick snack and drink. Immediately loved the vibes, very chill but divey\u2026 but not. The titos and soda was very balanced, hit the spot. The blonde waitress with cute nails was so sweet and gave us great local recommendations. The wings were bomb af! Def going back. Went on a Saturday for a Gergia Bulldawgs game with some friends. It was packed so service was pretty slow. One of the TVs had a horrible gren hue to it, one was running about 10 minutes behind of the others. Nothing tasted fresh, the fries were either frozen or had been sitting out for a while and were cold, but the seasoning was really good. Fish also had the texture of pre frozen fish but had a nice light batter. The nachos were very soggy by the time they got to the table and were not hot. Biggest issue was that in the women's room the locks DO NOT WORK. They unlock if someone turns the handle from the outside. Had to ask for water multiple times and at some point our server stopped showing up so we had to track them down. The hostess was leaning on the podium smacking gum with her mouth open. If you into a loud sports bar atmosphere this is your place. First time here on on a Saturday evening ( before a Northeastern hockey game) & the place was cooking!\nOne observation- from an insurance liability standpoint- coming through the front door, bearing left and then bearing right DOWN a step towards the bar\u2026 be careful. Lighting not good in that area highlighting that step down. My suggestion- my suggestion is new strips on the floor.\nGreat selection of beers! The bar had a deal on pizza & wings and I wouldn't pay anything for what I was served. Unfortunately both were inedible. The bartender never asked me if I needed another drink and that's probably for the better, because drink prices were insane. The only thing I enjoyed was the music and the sports on TV. Clerys, located at 113 Dartmouth St, Boston, MA 02116, is a popular haunt for young professionals and college students alike,  just a stone's throw away from Back Bay Station. My alma mater hosted an event here before.\n\nOverall Service: 3.34/5\nFoods: 2.5/5, Service: 4/5, Ambiance: 3.5/5, Cleanliness: 3.5/5\n\nWith multiple bars, including a separate dance floor on the lower level, it can accommodate a sizeable crowd of up to 393 people (according to the staff). The place tends to get packed post-9pm on weekends, but it maintains a more relaxed vibe during weekdays. The friendly staff, especially the bartenders, add to the welcoming atmosphere. A tip: if you're yearning for a seat, scout the areas with large TVs; most patrons prefer to queue up for the dance floor.\n\nWhen it comes to foods, unfortunately, Clerys didn't quite hit the mark here. The chicken wings, despite their reputation on the menu, were a disappointment. Overcooked and dry, they left my taste buds longing for more. The garlic parmesan sauce, too, fell short, barely coating the wings and leaving the flavor flat. Maybe it was my bad luck. A silver lining was found in the Bee Sting sauce, boasting hot honey, garlic, and red chili \u2013 a tantalizing combination. My wish is that they'd be more generous with the celery and carrot accompaniments given the portion size.\n\nThe potstickers, well, they were just okay, nothing that set them apart from your average Chinese takeout. On a brighter note, the cocktails at Clerys did manage to salvage our evening, offering a tasty respite.\n\nAreas of improvements: (1) Clerys could benefit from some quality control in the kitchen to elevate their food offerings. (2) When the place gets crowded, the restroom can become less than appealing. Brunch was great! I would recommend making a reservation as it was quite busy. The food was delicious. I got the grilled blueberry muffin, the egg sliders, and the breakfast potatoes. Mimosa was good too! We went there for brunch, and even though the service was very long because of a mistake with the waitress machine, we were very well taken care of. They offered us 50% discount for the mistake which eas really appreciated, since we waited an hour for our plates.\nFood was really good, staff was very friendly and the place is charming. We did not book in advance and still manage to find us a place.\nI recommend! We had brunch reservation for 5, December 8, were seated just fine at 11:15 but they are sorely understaffed. After 40 minutes Four meals arrived and one was so late to arrive he could not eat it aside from it being late it was cold. Rock hard cold toast on every plate.  No one took a coffee order. I had to get up find a waitperson 2x to ask for water, coffee, and the bill. The party next to us shared similar comments. In total it took over 2 hours. Went in last minute brunch with my friends this past weekend on Saturday 3/22. We were sat quickly. Our server Mia J was really nice and had great table manners. As a server myself I found her service awesome. Food was good too. No complaints from anyone in the party. Brunch was the meal I ate at the Boston. MA location.  The location is convenient because a parking lot is next door, and it is close to other shopping or experiences in the area.  Our server was great , she was pleasant, patient, and friendly.  The food was served hot, and it came as they were described on the menu.  The Check-out process was easy because the server has a handheld device to accept your card payment.  While the food was fresh, all but the egg sandwich lacked seasoning;  so it makes me wonder if this place only has a cook and not a chef cooking/supervising its preparation.  Most restaurants regardless of who is serving the customer make it so every server can respond to or follow-up when your assigned server is overwhelmed but at this place although I was waiving my hand to get the hostess attention she ignored me until I got up from my chair to ask for more napkins and my check.  Eventually, I got both, but the hostess appeared frustrated that I asked for this help.  If I had to eat here again, I would if I had to stay local, but I would go with the egg sandwich because that did have a flavor that my mouth enjoyed. Brunch was great!

Zuchinni noodles with eggplant meatballs and ginger beet lemonade is awesome I am so happy that the Dartmouth St., Boston, B.GOOD location has remained open during the pandemic.  I have always enjoyed the food at this location - always excellent and the people are warm, friendly, courteous and efficient.  I was so happy to see that several of the employees were still employed.  Whenever I am in the area I order food through their app - which is easy and informative.  I can even customize my order and it is always prepared exactly as requested.  Healthy food so well prepared and delivered by the best team.  I would HIGHLY recommend. I order lunch from B.GOOD  very often ( Boston -Dartmouth st location).\nTheir phone app is easy to use.\nThe food is always the same good quality and quantity! They pay attention to my gluten allergy and they have a good selection of gluten free options on their menu! I highly recommend this place! True to the name, B.Good delivers on real food fast. They're supporters of local businesses, responsible agriculture, and has one of the most friendly staff I've ever seen at a fast food restaurant.\n\nI eat here regularly and the quality and service is always top notch. They have gluten-free burger buns and lots of options for toppings. While the Chicken isn't gluten-free I'm always reminded by the staff when I accidentally order it *love*.\n\nThe salads are seasonal and always knock my socks off with a perfect combination of salty, sweet, and crunchy.\n\nOh, and try their shakes both the fro-yo and ice cream ones are superb! If you're looking for something fresh and fast--- this seems like a good option. The juices were delicious. Loved them and they had an assortment of unique flavor mixes. The salad was quite expensive for the quality and ingredients. It was supposed to have beans, corn and avocado and there might have been once piece.  It was fresh and there was a nice assortment, but not quite the quality I was expecting for the price. The place is phenomenal in terms of the overall design and space itself.  While it's dimly lit it feels very spacious but doesn't feel like you're out of space even if you go in there with shirts/shorts (which I did...).\n\nThe service was fantastic.  In fact our sushi came out so fast it probably took less than five minutes.  Granted, we did go there around 4pm on Saturday so it wasn't crowded at all.\n\nNow the 1-star deduction is the sushi itself.  Unfortunately for the price (I get it, it's Boston), the overall experience of the sushi was around 6 out of 10.  The rolls were beautifully presentation wise.  A bit too much on the rice that wasn't as plump and one roll had rice packed so tightly it made the bite rather strong.  There was more vegetable and rice than the the actual fish itself.  The fish was very much underwhelming.  We've had much better sushi in other places in that sense.\n\nTheir Korean BBQ was one of the best we had though.  VERY tender and seasoned just right.\n\nOverall, the experience and the staff were very professional and we had a great time.  A little disappointed with the sushi but we are a bit of a sashimi and sushi snobs so take it with a grain of salt.  It is fresh so if you're not picky you cannot go wrong. This place is a great vibe for a dinner. Great place for big groups. The lighting is perfect and the music is kept to a low to enjoy group conversations. The ambience in general is good and the decorations inside are super cool.\n\nBeer collection is passable. The service just took a really long time and portions were huge. Average choices of vegetarian food. They'll customize the food according to how you want it. Upsacle restaurant. Very nice ambience. Food is served hot and on time.\n\nWe tried: island mai tai, bamboo juice and Bombay jewel.\n\nApps: lobster rangoons, veg spring roll(best veg spring roll ever had), scallion pancakes.\n\nMain: crunchy roll sushi, green monster(best veg sushi). Tik tok chicken and house fried rice. Food and atmosphere is great. I really enjoyed the sushi and other appetizers that I had there. Also great music and place turns into a club at night. Great food, solid hospitality (thank you Armani!). Really enjoyed dinner here. Food quality, doneness and freshness are splendid. Would definately recommend to friends. The only downside was how long we needed to wait to retrieve our car from the valet, so if you're heading here on a weekend, I suggest giving the claim ticket to the valet a good 20-30 mins before you intend to leave. The restaurant offers a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Service is exceptionally fast, with staff demonstrating great attentiveness to customers. It is a popular spot among locals, adding to its authentic charm. The food is well-prepared, perfectly seasoned, and thoughtfully curated, offering a harmonious blend of flavors. Highly recommended and will come back A fun brunch spot with great food and friendly service. We were able to walk in and be seated quickly. The menu has a lot of options and our waiter was kind enough to do four separate checks. I got the chorizo Benedict and it was great! Would definitely come back and recommend if you're in the area. Stumbled on this place by accident but glad I did!! The restaurant is fun and welcoming and staff members are extremely friendly. I got the breakfast burrito with turkey ends and it was AMAZING. Highly suggest coming to this place. It was slightly busy when I went so make sure you plan ahead of time and possibly get reservations if they offer it We stumbled upon this place in a Google search, waited 30 min to get in on a Wednesday - no regrets! Best meal we had in Boston. Amazing food and service! It was okay \ud83d\ude0b The food was satisfactory for us, perhaps because we have experienced a significantly better breakfast restaurant in Massachusetts, which serves as a basis for comparison. Additionally, there was a gentleman, possibly one of the hosts, positioned by the entrance, whose personal hygiene was notably lacking. I hope he will take steps to improve this aspect. I apologize for mentioning this, but I hope it will be constructive feedback. Thank you. We came in pretty late, so it was quiet. The atmosphere was really chill. Our server, Eric, was so charming and friendly.\nI had a mocktail called The Oasis. It  was absolutely divine. Their cocktail and fries were really good.\nHappy hour oysters were such a good deal which is only available on Monday and Friday 4-7pm. The wait and bar staff are always prompt, kind, and accomdating. I love that you can order an off menu cocktail and it's actually made correctly (good margaritas are hard to come by in Boston but Merchant never disappoints). The food is great especially for the price. Highly recommend! We had a group dinner at The Merchant, and while the food was pretty good, the service really missed the mark. Even though the place was only about a third full, our drinks took forever to come out, so much so that we were almost done with our appetizers by the time the first round finally arrived. It was a bit frustrating that we weren't checked in on often, so we ended up not ordering much more. The food did make up for it to some extent\u2014it was definitely tasty\u2014but the slow service put a damper on the experience. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth a visit if you\u2019re in the area, but just be prepared for a potentially slower pace. Probably my favorite restaurant I had on my work trip to Boston. It was a group dinner and we had so much food. The calamari and wings were amazing! I got the Palomina (?) drink and the burger and a wedge salad as my meal. Our service Makayla was amazing and knowledgeable about the food menu and the drink menu. This is my SECOND time eating here - - liked it so much LAST WEEK I made special trip this week.  Had cheeseburger last week - - one of the VERY BEST I have ever had.  The onion rings - - - thin-sliced PURPLE onions - - are the absolute BEST.  This week I tried the Crispy Chicken sandwich - - - GO FOR THE BURGER - - similar at McDonald's is better - - still GOOD, though.  The Raspberry Lime Rickey was nice.  Thanks, team. Stopped here while waiting for a train.......food took almost 15 mins and it didnt appear that busy.  Honestly one of the worst burgers I have ever been served.  Not only was my burger basically raw the other we were served was half raw half medium (didn't even think this was possible).  We also ordered tots and they were flavorless and unsalted.  Will not be back. Great food, and a quick stop. We wanted something fast and good. This place had food, good food, to us in less than 10 minutes. Waiting for my train, I decided to grab a bite. The smash burger was tasty and good. The fries were hot, crisp, and good. The store has its own style, is inside but separate from the train station, and has a full service bar as well. I'd def make another purchase next time I stop thru that area. I enjoyed my meal! \u201cThis is a Tasty Burger\u201d (in the voice of Jules Winnfield). Really impressed by this place. Was pleasantly surprised by how good the burger was and that a small bar existed in there. Staff was extremely polite and responsive and the price was perfect for what I was looking to spend for lunch in Boston. Right between Copley and Back Bay MBTA station - I\u2019ll be stopping in more often on my Boston trips going forward. Best customer service EVER! I was rushing late to a train so I got my food but not my coffee, and a minute later one of the employees runs down with my coffee! Bless this man and I hope he gets a raise! Trash, waste of calories. Beyond disappointed. Told the manager it was the saddest wake up wrap i\u2019ve ever seen. He was kind enough to offer to make another wake up wrap but no way are you playing with my food twice. I just walked away with such disappointment in these employees, a woman bought a homeless man a coffee and bagel, and he shortly after dropped his coffee, when he went up to ask for a new one, the employee behind the counter said you didn\u2019t pay for that, I spoke up and said yes someone did buy that for him, he then went to open his bag with a bagel and cream cheese in it and there was no cream cheese, the man said he didn\u2019t get a cream cheese and the employee started speaking arabic, the homeless man started to get upset and said you just called me a bad name in arabic, then the employee started raising his voice and swearing and myself and another customer started defending the man resulting in him being given his strawberry cream cheese. To add some details to this story, the homeless man had no fingers and was clearly struggling with mental illness or was developmentally delayed. What a disgusting show of zero compassion for another human being. I will never stop at this dunkin\u2019 donuts again and i truly urge the owner of this location to do some sensitivity training for your staff because they are seriously lacking. Also, the fact that they swore in front of at least 7/8 customers with such ease is a huge red flag. Long queues and the sausage egg croissant I ordered was unpleasant. The croissant was hard and stiff like it\u2019d be reheated multiple times over.\n\nConcerned about the cleanliness due to the sheer number of pigeons fluttering around. Come here only if you have no other choice like I did. I always go there when I\u2019m on my way to my job, and I get a quick breakfast. It\u2019s an okay service expect today I asked for a glaze donut and I finally open the bag and I get this. It\u2019s covered with some hair or something Best customer service EVER!

It\u2019s covered with some hair or something Club Caf\u00e9 is one of my favorite go-to spots in the South End, especially for weekend brunch. My friends and I come here often\u2014whether we have a play to see at the nearby Lyric Stage or not. I believe the restaurant gives a discount if you have a ticket. Check with your server as rules may change.\n\nThe atmosphere is always lively, the brunch is consistently wonderful, and the prices are a great value for the quality and experience.\n\nI personally recommend the Eggs Benedict and the Maryland crab cakes\u2014both are absolutely delicious. One of my friends always gets the buttermilk pancakes and loves them, and another friend is a big fan of the Cobb salad. They\u2019ve also tried a couple of the cocktails and said they were very good.  Highly recommend the berry pies with ice cream.\n\nOne thing to be aware of: the bathrooms are unisex, and while that\u2019s not a problem, there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve. Most women head straight to the first restroom\u2014which happens to be the one with urinals. Men, in the know, usually skip to the second bathroom without urinals. It might help to label the doors more clearly (e.g., \u201cBathroom with Urinals\u201d vs. just \u201cBathroom\u201d) to avoid any confusion.\n\nThere is a step outside that either one of my friends or I trip over. Every. Single. Time. We do this even though we are careful.  Just be careful.\n\nService here is friendly and relaxed\u2014not the fastest, but warm and welcoming.\n\nAll in all, Club Caf\u00e9 is a hidden treasure. Those who know it, know it\u2014and once you do, you\u2019ll likely be back. I highly recommend it for a fun and flavorful brunch in the South End. Came here for drinks on election night so please keep this in mind. The atmosphere was good and included people of all ages. Plenty of screens to watch the election. The drinks were fun but could be a little sweet. The food is your typical bar food, but the burger was pretty good. It took a while to receive drinks and get our order in, it did make us wonder if no one had been assigned to our table. However, as soon as we spoke to someone about it, they were helpful. In another scenario where this night was not terrible and marked by fear and despair, I could see coming back here for a drag show or trivia. However, I might need more space since the election. This was a very unexpected \ud83d\udc8e.  My sister and I found this place just by luck.  I can tell it's amazing.  The drinks are on point.  The bar tender has some skill.  The food, just yum.  I am a sucker for sweet potato fries and these are \ud83e\udd24. It's very low key. Great music and if you really want they have a ton of tvs you can watch something.  We will def be back for an early night \ud83c\udf78 I have lived in Boston for 15 years and have been to club cafe numerous times. Recently though the security staff has been very aggressive. It makes the concept that club cafe is a safe haven for queer people, specially people of color - a joke. This has also been noted by various reviews here. I am not one to go bash a business online but sometimes accountability on how your organization is run is necessary.\n\nWe were at Club Cafe last night and my husband went out to smoke a cigarette. When he tried to enter back after smoking, he was denied entry by a security guard stating they don't let people enter the establishment past 11:45 pm. I begged and pleaded the security guard to let my husband in so we could finish our meal and head out. He refused so I decided to walk out. While we were both outside waiting for our friends to finish their meal, my husband and I decided to light a cigarette. The security guard then walked up to me outside on the sidewalk and hit me unprovoked throwing my unlit cigarette on the floor. I told him that he cannot assault anyone on public property so he got two other security guards - one of whom was wearing black shorts and black t shirt and had tattoos. He was very aggressive and decided to push my husband onto the sidewalk and he hit the concrete floor necessitating calling an ambulance and spending the night at the emergency room. I pushed the security guard back and the other security guard hit me in my face sending my glasses onto the sidewalk and breaking them.\n\nThe cops were called and an ambulance was called for necessary medical attention. I have left a voicemail to their security manager asking for a footage from the night but I doubt I will get it. I have meanwhile filed a police report and will be following up with assault charges due to the use of excessive force.\n\nI would tell everyone who is queer and thinks of this space as a safe space to be very weary. They target people and use excessive force on patrons. I am doubtful any of these 'bouncers' have received any training to de-escalate. There is no reason a patron in a business should be going to a hospital in an ambulance because they were assaulted by a member of that business.\n\nWish I could give zero stars I went to club Caf\u00e9 for the first time since I\u2019ve been living in Boston for eight years. I went for the fundraiser the Belmart and supporting the fundraising over Christmas for the gay bear boston community.\n\nI went outside to hang out with one of my friends and chat, and we noticed that a lift driver was blocking the bike lane and had ran over a cone or one of the metal stations to mark the lane.  One of the patrons kindly went up and said, sir I don\u2019t know if you notice this, but you\u2019re blocking the bike lane, and you\u2019ve run over one of the Lain metal dividers and we just wanted to let you know. It came out of concern for not damaging the vehicle and just letting the individual know not to pop his tires rolling over a metal piece attached to the road while he\u2019s working.\n\nThis is what ensued afterwards. I did hit emergency record twice on my iPhone that did not record the first 30 seconds. the last minute security finally came out of the bar. The fist photos is actually a video that Google won\u2019t allow. But it\u2019s a straight up gay hate crime what he said and how he treated every patron who was at the club cage.\n\nBy the way, the security staff at club Caf\u00e9 is a joke.\n\nThey don\u2019t even have a gun, they don\u2019t have a taser, they have no ability to control anything, yet they still kicked the gay patrons out of the bar and left the Uber/ Lyft driver alone. When your own establishment won\u2019t stand up for a gay hate crime, why do we even go to the bar?\n\nThen after patrons who were sober were kicked out of the bar. The Lyft driver moved the car to be legally parked. That is the 2nd photos.  20 minute between video and photo."

    "reviews": "Have nothing but wonderful things to say about Venus Nails and Spa. This is my 3rd time coming and I will keep coming back. I have been looking for a new nail salon for a while now and I finally found it. Everyone is so kind, thorough, friendly and overall fantastic. I would high recommend! I have seen a few different techs and all of them were phenomenal. This time I had Kristine and she was great. I feel sometimes walking in a new salon it can be awkward but when walking in I feel very welcomed. When I call to schedule an appointment, the owner answers \u201cHi Krystine\u201d which I find awesome. Thank you Venus nails and Spa! I heard great things about this place! Love my nails! Kristine was amazing, super sweet, and we talked the whole time! Definitely recommend coming here! :) I'm thrilled I tried this nail salon, especially after a disastrous experience at my previous salon. The owner was warm and welcoming, even offering me a parking spot in the back when Main Street was full.\n\nMy nail technician, Kristeen, was exceptional. With over 20 years of experience, she's a true expert in her field. Not only did she do an outstanding job, but she also took the time to explain why my previous set didn't turn out well.\n\nI was impressed that the price to fix the previous salon's work was very reasonable. Kristeen used tap gel, a natural product perfect for weak, brittle nails like mine. I highly recommend trying it out, and be sure to ask for Kristeen \u2013 you won't regret it! I really love this place. They really care about you and want to provide customer service and make sure you leave happy definitely recommend. I went a few months ago in the winter. Got a pedicure with Annie!  She did amazing! Then today, I walked in kind of an emergency as I left another nail salon with a really bad paint job met Kristine! She redid my nails with care and  gave me the french tip I wanted. Thank you Christine. I had a really great experience here. I got a gel manicure and the price was really reasonable ($35). The person who did my nails was very kind and efficient. I am writing this review 5 days after getting the manicure, and my nails have not chipped at all!

The person who did my nails was very kind and efficient. I am writing this review 5 days after getting the manicure, and my nails have not chipped at all! Highly recommend Won't recommend at all ,it's only feast for the eyes but once you taste it all the hype is gone.i feel it's little over priced as compared to other shops around it .would definitely recommend University House of pizza over this Iconic stop on the corner of Mass Ave and Columbus Ave\nLots of tasty options. Great for s quick bite. Authentic NY style pizza in a hole-in-the-wall setting. Pizza was good, I would go back. Good pizza, nice place to eat on lunch break. Not happy at all\u2026. Not sure what is going on the past 3 visits have not been good the Pizza has not been there Signature . Tonight the pizza was dry the crust was over cooked too thin in some spots, too thick in others and extremely tough. Just not good. It smells burnt\u2026think I am heading over to South Ens House of Pizza to grab some French Fries.\nSo disappointed this Pizza isn\u2019t even good enough to be drink food. We originally came in for the Buck for a Shuck oysters (who can resist $1 oysters?) thinking we\u2019d try a few and keep it light. Fast forward a couple of hours, and we had devoured 72 oysters\u2014yes, seventy-two\u2014and loved every single one. They were unbelievably fresh and perfectly shucked.\n\nBut the real surprise? The rest of the menu. We decided to try a few appetizers and mains, and every bite was a knockout. Thoughtfully plated, full of flavor, and clearly made with care. This place isn\u2019t just about oysters\u2014it\u2019s a full-on culinary experience.\n\nHuge shoutout to Angel, our server, who was absolutely fantastic. Friendly, knowledgeable, and made sure we were taken care of from start to finish. We came for the deal, but we stayed (and will be coming back) for the quality and the vibes. A must-visit spot! The portion sizes were quite small, and the risotto was disappointing\u2014especially considering it\u2019s one of the more expensive items on the menu. The lamb kebab was overcooked, which was surprising and a bit disappointing for a Mediterranean restaurant. That said, the ribs were absolutely amazing and would be the one reason I\u2019d consider going back. The atmosphere is definitely a highlight\u2014very aesthetic and perfect for a sunny day out. You have to go here! Every dish was amazing and the service was impeccable. Their wine selection was also great. Our first time trying Moroccan wine. We asked our friend to be with in our wedding here and they were very accommodating to make that a surprise. And overall, the atmosphere is fantastic. Perfect for a group gathering, girls night or a date night. Ilona truly exceeded all expectations. From the creative cocktails to the phenomenal food, every part of our experience was a delight. We shared several dishes from the menu, and each bite was a pure bliss. Highly recommended! I walked in and asked which oysters were available for the happy hour. The waitress told me she would have to double check and get back to me on that. When I was seated at my table, I asked her if everything on the menu was available for happy hour and she sarcastically said ya.\n\nIt was impossible to get additional slices of lemon. For context we got 56 oysters for two people. We already requested for extra lemon slices when placing our order but it didn\u2019t come. Hence we requested once again when the order came. We waited for awhile and was halfway done with our a dozen and a half oysters, still no lemons came. I raised my hand for a good 2-3 mins whist three waiters stood facing my direction, and none bothered to come to me. Finally one waiter came and provided us with our lemons. When we were nearly done with our meal, only did the rest of the waiters give us our lemons slices which were already served. Overall it was a very unpleasant experience. If you\u2019re not going to Darryl\u2019s what are you doing with your life? First time visit and I was over the moon. We brought a friend for a birthday (this is a place you gotta bring your bday person) and they treated her like a queen and were so generous and kind.\nService was great, cocktails were *chefs kiss*, food was exactly what we wanted while listening to the live music. I constantly had chills by how talented and remarkable they were. Host staff was on point and were so sweet. It made us all really happy to be there. I appreciated that we were in the side room area from the stage and could watch on video and hear everything perfectly. I\u2019m a little sensitive to loud noises and it was comfortable! We couldn\u2019t have been happier with our experience and will be bringing people in droves. Great food, super rich in flavor and cooked well that it\u2019s not dry. Comes with live music on weekend, and atmosphere is also lively. Can be loud if someone wants to enjoy the restaurant, it can be hard to hear. Service seems to be unorganized as we had 4 people asked if we ordered already, yet our food and drinks took awhile...Overall would recommend this place to try out! Went out here for a double date. Super great food, a live band and great service with the owners actively present. Would definitely come here again. The Sugar Baby drink is to die for. Beware of running late or thinking it's a game--10 to 20 minutes late from the evening opening and you'll lose your spot already haha. It gets filled up exceptionally quick. Make a reservation or try your chances at your own risk! Denise service was fantastic! She took good care of us. Make sure to make a reservation well in advance. We didn\u2019t and had to sit at the bar. Which was nice too. Good drinks, good food, great service. Music is on point too.\n\nHighly recommend the fish tacos and the sticky pepper wings. The calamari was too sweet for our liking. Shrimp and grits was good Great vibe! Loved the live music but was a bit loud when trying to have a convo.  Wait staff was friendly and provided great service. Food was good. Menu had a variety of items with more seafood options than anything else. My girl enjoyed the jambalaya - said it was the best she'd ever had and was spicy! I enjoyed my burger. Drinks were tasty but not strong.

I was terrified of anyone watching my 15 month old Lucy. She's only been babysat 3 days since she's been born, if that tells you anything.\n\nI was a SAHM and recently went back to work, and they've made the transition so much easier, knowing she is in good hands. The staff and owner are amazing and have been so patient with my little one."

    "reviews": "Excellent service, Se\u00f1or Parache, was absolutely dedicated to making sure the client got what he wanted. With his great energy and positive attitude patiently made it happen. Will be coming for more along with many more. Awesome fade, excellent equipment and know how. Dwayne is also a master either way you won\u2019t go wrong You find yourself in a new town, and you're faced with the problem of trying to find someone who can cut and style your hair just like 'back home'. This time I rolled the dice and came up winnin'! I read about A1 online then happened to walk by their shop on the way to my interview. I was not disappointed when I saw them work in the flesh.\n\nRob did a heckuva job. He listened to what I described for what I wanted then built in that as he said back to me how the cut was gonna go. I appreciated what he said and how he said it, then watched it all come together. I even dosed off at one point, and he was still careful, but creative with the cut.\n\nAnd before that, while I was waiting,\nI noticed something that even today can be rare: a female barber, of another ethnicity than the dominant one of the area, AND, she wasn't no rookie. This seasoned veteran, finished cutting, and styling a young guy in decent time and not too much flair. It not not only looked great, but I heard him express his gratitude and satisfaction as he looked in the mirror.\n\nAll that to say, A1 has some great barbers who listen to you, and care about their finished product. And even if you're not new to town, they're worth a shot. These have been my dudes for over a year. Daniel is a beast. Highly recommended. Just finished getting a haircut here from the Jamaican dude all the way in the back. I never write reviews, but please do not go here ever again. Not only haircut was awful, also cut me up in all areas of the forehead. Found Ismael on Google and for sure he exceeded my expectations with a hella legit fade. Playa playa Went there for luggage dropping. The owner is super friendly and super helpful. I had problems with internet when connecting to uber, the owner was trying his best to help me and finally I can get to the airport. Many thanks to him \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb I've been bringing my dry cleaning here since moving into the neighborhood a few years ago. The guy I usually see there is really nice, the prices are reasonable and I think they do a great job! Soon is super friendly and always has my suits looking new. The only dry cleaner I will go to in Boston, and he always gets everything done super fast! i love this place! I am 3 blocks away and have another 2 drycleaners closer to me but I still make the walk to come to Sue. He is always nice and friendly and always such a clean, neat and fast job! he knows his customers too. he remembers what u have dropped off! it feels good to know he cares for his customers. The worst cleaner ever. Brought my WHITE coat and got a grey one:) Asked before \u201cis everything going to be fine\u201d and the answer was \u201cyes, yes, no problem\u201d. When I get the puffer he said \u201cI cannot be perfect\u201d. My puffer now looks really bad , not white and looks like dirty, but it the color of it now! Great service from Samaria and Katerin. Helped me fix my ripped check. They are very nice and helpful, definitely will be coming back because of then. They have three people working right now at 1:00 am But only one person is at the desk What's the point of the other two. I've waited for about an hour already. Their service here very fantastic also staff are helpful!!! Emily always welcome customers with great vibes! Great place I cash my check there every 2 weeks when I get paid the staff there are the best I will always go there if I need check cashed Franyelyn was very helpful and informative at every detail of my transaction. Made my transaction smoother! I loved it! First off, I didn't feel weird because I'm a woman who went to get her hair cut. And second I had Omar and I love the cut he did, especially since I had my hair dyed and when he faded my hair he made the color blend well. I recommend him. All the men there were nice and professional. I recommend Pedro! He even helped practice Spanish with me. He went above and beyond on every detail. Got my small afro cut here today. My coworker recommended it. He pays 25 but I was charged 45\u2026 but that\u2019s not the issue - prob the worst haircut I\u2019ve ever gotten. Blend in the fade is terrible. Worst haircut I\u2019ve ever gotten. I regret cutting my hair so bad. Would not recommend Bless Got my first haircut in a year here. Guy could tell I was nervous, didn't let me look in the mirror the whole time lol. Reassuring, knew exactly what I wanted based off a vague description and a few photos, did me so right. Love it, will be back. Go see my boy Pedro. Been getting cut by no one but him for over a year. Never dissatisfied. Don't let that sign with $13 on it fool you -- my high n tight was $35. Not complaining, just letting people know it's not $13! Walked in tried to get a quick cut. There was no wait except 1 person currently getting a cut. I was told I was next & waited for an entire hour. Left without a cut. Never going back there again. Omar does my son\u2019s hair . It always turns out great . One of the best barbershops in Boston. Great shop. Come by and check us out. Am lady who needed a fresh fade. Was worried about the reviews that talked about inappropriate conversation but was pleasantly surprised by the politeness of everyone who worked there. Got my cut from Josh and have no regrets. These haircuts at these prices. It's GREEEEEEEEAT. Been a go-to spot for us ever since we moved to the south end 2 years ago. A surprisingly great selection of basics and booze, reasonable prices, very kind staff and dog friendly (so nice to pop in for items on evening walks). Can\u2019t say enough nice things. Great store. Great customer service. Vinny who runs the store is the best and super friendly. Always helpful and he is very knowledgeable helping you pick out certain beer or wine. Been going to this place from over 1 year the Place is Nice & clean staff is always Friendly. Good selection of wine especial from California wines.Love to come here. This store has transformed \u2014 amazing selection of beer, wine, and better groceries and staples than in previous years. Very friendly staff. Such a great store. Very clean and they manage to always have everything you could need. That were nice friendly the machines were Clean very excellent service I use the large machine I had clothes that had been building up since I got to Boston Massachusetts on March 22 ,2022 and I just came in to wash at 3:00 PM on April 15 , 2022 And the  lady that was running the laundry mat she was so courteous nice and sweet told  me what size washer I need it to use and I was using the pods gain detergent and she told me how many pods to put in there and explain to me each little slot where you put the money holds 2 quarters each $7.00 for the large washer and I had a huge garbage bag full and I was amazed that I can only use one washer for $7.00 dollars I will definitely come here again to wash clothes nice and clean in here they do a lot of full-service laundry as well and  self-service laundry awesome thanks so much ladies for your help and hospitality When going to the laundromat I had checked on my clothes frequently when washing them. When I came back 10 minutes later, my clothes was gone, and one of the workers had moved my clothes to the side without even asking  me. very upset about that unprofessional, and didn\u2019t even apologize for moving my things. recommend if you go here to keep a close eye on your clothes can\u2019t even trust the employees. Unfriendly, expensive visit. Cost nearly $20 for two loads of clothes I had to do laundry while on a multi-city vacation. This place is open relatively early (8am) before touristy stuff, and the owner and maybe her son were both there at 8am and able to exchange my $20 for lower bills & quarters to use the machines.\n\nNote that she only gives quarters for customers to use the machines. She does not provide change for other purposes or for non-customers. (If you need a $20 in order to even exchange it with her, you can go across the corner to the southwest, where there is an ATM in a separate room next to the 24 hour convenience store - the attendant will open the door to the ATM room for you. This nearby location of an accessible ATM for people carrying their laundry with them makes this laundromat's location extra convenient for those who come to the city without any cash on-hand.)\n\nBack to the laundromat itself, there are a very large number of machines (some new and some old), and the machines are clean. The floor itself looks a bit dirty, but it might just be because it is old tiling - even when it's cleaned, it tends to look worse over time.\n\nSignage clearly indicates the cost of using the washers and their method of operation. A sign near the front of the store also tells people the costs so they know how much they may need to exchange into quarters. Prices are fair - any less and I don't think they'd be able to stay in business.\n\nIf you live or have a hotel room within a mile of this laundromat, it is where I would recommend going. Stayed at Westin Copley place.  The place they refer to in hotel is a multi chain laundromat with scheduled pickups and next day delivery and signing up for an account. Big hassle. This place answered phone, picked up within a half hour, did the laundry very nicely, folded it  and delivered it back to hotel a few hours later.  All very professionally. Service could not be better at fair and reasonable price and recommend giving them a try . Been a go-to spot for us ever since we moved to the south end 2 years ago.

Service could not be better at fair and reasonable price and recommend giving them a try . Amazing haircut every time from Van. He is consistent, cares about what he does and is an absolute expert at his craft. Would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a great cut in the Boston area at a reasonable price. I make the trip to him from work at DTX and will never get a haircut from anyone else again. Van is the real deal!! Rio is one of the best in the area when it comes to haircut quality, education and overall experience. Great guy who helps you better understand your hair while providing input into the haircut itself. It's definitely on the pricier side, but after my first trip I couldn't go anywhere else. Van is incredible. So fun to talk to and seems like a really big fish in a small pond in Boston. He\u2019s been a barber to multiple celebrities in NY and opened a famous barber shop there before marrying a woman from Boston. I hope he never leaves! Van is an excellent barber and is never boring. Always an enjoyable experience. Staff is incredibly professional and super friendly. The haircut is always on point and they are always giving me great tips on keeping the hair looking good. I use Rio, but both barbers are amazing. Highly recommend. On March 1st 2025 at 8:45 am I came into the resturant before leaving for a ski trip. I ordered a turkey sausage egg and cheese croissant. And shortly after realized there was an advertisement for a Sausage egg and cheese on a croissant, with hash browns and a coffee or tea for $6. I asked to pay the difference to get the advertised deal. I was told yes, but I could only receive a pork sausage.  The add clearly states SAUSAGE EGG AND CHEESE. After 20 min back an forth. I asked for a manager's name and the number to corporate to make a complaint.  I was denied that information as well. I asked the male worker for the managers name and the number to corporate and he followed the lead of the woman who denied me the information.  It was an older Hatian woman, who clearly doesn't know how to handle customers. When I asked for a manager. She said she was the manager. And I asked for HER managers information.  All an all I spent $10 on a sausage egg and cheese and a chai tea and no hash browns i simply wanted to recieve the advertised deal. Waste of time and money.\nI ordered a maple bacon sandwich and got a charred bacon instead, not burnt, but charred bacon!  The coffee tasted bitter. Terrible all around asked to use the rest room asnt about to let me cause I Ionly j,no getting iry spenr 225 the toilet was broken I was only one in the store. One lady doesn\u2019t take order from me, she was doing some food.. Other one stay in restroom for a while.. Bad service. Lady which was in restroom even never ask me if I would like to order something The music is too loud they're bumping it like it's a nightclub at 6:00 in the morning no thank you the staff you know I can't get too mad at the staff because it's the management they're the problem you train your employees you need to do better I just placed an order through Uber eats and I was very unsatisfied with my sandwich due to the fact that it was the wrong sandwich I'm at work which is why I didn't come in and pick it up myself you have to do better as a company for us the community that goes to your place I feel like the manager here is really crappy she should be fired to be honest she's been in that position role way too long and messing up way too much I had plant-based dinner and it was delicious. There are limited options but the servers are nice enough to discuss them and make modifications. The food was great. Multiple dishes had a smoky flavor which added a great taste. Service was great! One of my favorite restaurants in Boston back in 2021. Food quality went downhill a lot. Atmosphere is still great, good for a date night/ gathering. Close to Mass Ave MBTA station The atmosphere of this place is beautiful and the food was delicious and novel. The service was acceptable for this level of restaurant.\n\nCocktails: I loved the 63 fairbanks and it was just as the server described it, fun and flirty. The tawny toddy was interesting like a spiked hot chocolate. And surprisingly I enjoyed the refreshing limoncello even though I thought previous ones I've had were too hard to drink.\n\nFood: The polenta alla milanese was interesting and deliciously crispy. The duck breast was so juicy and good - and there was quite a big portion of it. The bone marrow risotto was interesting but I don't think I would order it again. The dessert options were a little disappointing so we got gelato and I thought the affoghatto didn't use hot enough espresso.\n\nGenerally great experience here. Late review.....\n\nI was surprised to find out that it was a tapas style restaurant. The menu offering for drinks was ok. I personally had the negoni, but I didn't care for the aftertaste. For the meal, I asked the waitress what she would recommend since this was our first time dining here. Her recommendations were spot on except for the gnocchi (for me, it was to ricotta forward, but my friend loved it). Highly recommend the duck and the sandwich starter. For dessert, we had the tiramisu and apple tart-ish, with a complimentary raspberry ice cream. Be warned the tiramisu is big enough for two and isn't quite what you would expect.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable. I look forward to trying again in the spring or summer to see if the menu changes. SRV is a fantastic spot for a family dine-in experience. We had a short five-minute wait for our table despite it being a slightly busy evening, which speaks volumes about their efficient staff. The atmosphere was cool and awesome, making it a pleasant place to relax and enjoy a meal.\n\nWe tried the Tagliatelle with Beef, Venetian Spritz, and a few more delightful dishes, including the Gnocchi with Duck Sugo, Salt Cod Fritters, and their signature Tiramisu for dessert. Each item was flavorful and well-prepared, showcasing their culinary expertise. The moderate pricing added to the overall appeal of the dining experience.\n\nThe staff was outstanding\u2014active, super quick, and exceptionally professional yet friendly, making sure we felt comfortable throughout. Another bonus is the ample free street parking, which made our visit hassle-free.\n\nOne highlight was the music playlist, featuring a mix of upbeat yet soothing tracks that perfectly complemented the ambiance. Additionally, the restaurant is incredibly kid-friendly, making it an ideal choice for families.\n\nSRV offers a great dining experience, though perhaps a few unique touches could elevate it to perfection! Adorable coffee shop! So much cute seating inside, very cozy and comfortable. The staff was incredibly nice, and talked to us a bunch. The coffee itself was so so so good, and came in the cutest little cup. The store is unfortunately closing this week, so go before it does!! Very nice place to stop and have a drink, do some work, or just admire the scenery! The bagel was very nice, plus the jalape\u00f1o cream cheese was absolutely amazing, actual chunks of jalape\u00f1o and super fresh!\n\nMy only complaint is the salted maple latte did not really have a strong salt or maple flavor, but the coffee itself was delicious. Can\u2019t wait to come back when it\u2019s warm and sit outside while enjoying a latte! There is so much to learn about coffee. I just had a cup of coffee that blew me away! This Ethiopian pour over coffee tastes like Lipton tea. It tastes just like tea, not like coffee at all. WOW 5 Stars! Earned it! Coffee shop that appears small at first, but opens into a much larger space. Including a back sunroom and deck in warmer months. Commend them for offering the rarely seen pourover option. Features pastries from pain d'avignon and a variety of lunch options. Also large variety of Mem brand tea. The Costa Rican drip coffee was delicious. Great Coffee, and sandwiches! Cute little shop and I loved eating in the greenhouse! I definitely want to come back when leaves are on the trees!"

    "reviews": "We had a great dinner at MIDA! The short rib lasagna was so good. We started with the duck wings which I\u2019d def recommend. You can\u2019t go wrong with any bottle of wine on their list either.\nMake reservations if there\u2019s a show at Symphony Hall. Cozy spot on Tremont. I got the gluten-free shrimp carbonara and the staff were very knowledgeable on the food safety process! My friend got the gnocchi cacio e pepe which was also very good. The food did take a long time to come out but understandable since it was very busy. They had a coat check as well which was a nice surprise and helpful to manage the space! Definitely recommend the arancini! I recently went to dine at MIDA and my experience was fantastic! The moment I walked in, a vibrant and welcoming bar area full of lively chatter hit me. Service was great, the staff constantly attended to my table, the water glass never ran low, and they were always offered help with the menu. My lasagna was beautifully served with parmesan cheese, and equally delicious.  The manager, Dylan, was incredibly sweet and chatted even though the restaurant was brimming with customers. Anyone out there ready to try great Italian dining in Boston, MIDA will do it for you all! I had the Rock Shrimp Carbonara and Gnocchi Cacio e Pepe, and wow\u2014both were seriously amazing.\n\nThe Rock Shrimp Carbonara was creamy and rich without feeling too heavy. The shrimp added a nice sweetness, the prosciutto brought that salty, savory bite, and you could really taste the egg yolk in the sauce\u2014it made everything so velvety. The combo of grana padano and pecorino gave it this deep, cheesy flavor that tied it all together perfectly.\n\nThen the Gnocchi Cacio e Pepe\u2014honestly, probably the fluffiest gnocchi I\u2019ve ever had. They just melted in my mouth. Super simple but so flavorful, with that sharp pecorino romano and fresh cracked pepper hitting just right. It\u2019s one of those dishes where you taste every ingredient and nothing gets lost. Love dining at Mida, the food is amazing. Each time I been is a great different experience. Service is amazing and love Savannah at the bar! Love the citrus cake. I usually love the gelatos as they have a machine and make it fresh and top it w/olive oil, however the raspberry gelato was more like a sherbet and had ice speckles. Pistachio gelato 10/10. Foods that I recommend: Short rib lasagna, eggplant parmesan, bolognese pasta, shrimp carbonara, roasted chicken (the risotto that comes with the dish is salty) the meatballs, focaccia bread is a must try. The appetizers are also all really good."

    "reviews": "It was amazing. Stephanie was such a sweetheart and very understanding and helpful when it comes to me beginning my spirituality journey. Helped clarify and relieve a lot of worries and things I have going on in life so i would definitely recommend coming here and talking to Stephanie!!! My spouse and I met Stephanie for a reading last year, and our positive experience has stuck with me ever since. In addition, Stephanie recommended that I should consider meditation as a way to further connect with my spiritual self. I started doing this in mid-January 2025, and the results have been mind blowing and of great benefit. Thank you for your guidance Stephanie! I went here for my first reading and Stephanie was very down to earth and intuitive. Her space is very welcoming and told me some scarily accurate events in my life but gave me the clarity I've been needing. Highly recommend! Stephanie has a down to earth personality and very intuitive insights. She read my chakras and opened me up to understanding myself. She told me which chakra had a blockage. I had my chiropractor appointment the next day to go over my scan results and to my surprise the scan results showed exactly what Stephanie had said.  She is truly gifted. Get a reading with her, you will not regret it. My girlfriend and I had our first reading today with Stephanie, from the very start she was very accommodating of us and put our nerves at ease. The reading was very insightful and I feel like it revealed a lot about my life and what I need to focus on. I would highly recommend Stephanie to anyone who is wanting to get a tarot reading! Not open 24/7, false advertising and rude staff, also dirty and they dont have key items False advertising and when I went to purchase their butter, they had taped up a box that had butter stolen out of it and tried to sell it off as full price. Beware, these people are scammers. incorrect opening hours. stuff are more expensive than other 7-eleven stores. I don\u2019t know why you have the info saying you guys close at 12 when your employee close the store at 11 why give your customer fake info, it\u2019s 11:20 and this really rude guy told me he can not help me because the store it\u2019s close, what a lack of misinformation the owner of the store have with the employee I hate this 7-11 all the customers are very rude or homeless. I won't come to this 7-11. What excellent customer service moments before closing over the phone to help my Dad send flowers to his Bride of almost 56yrs while in the hospital. The description given and product delivered put my Ma in tears as she said it looked just like her wedding bouquet. It made the whole medical floor jealous of their decades of romance to see such beauty of love delivered in time of need. Thank you thank you thank you sooo much for such swift service and exceptional product. I received a dozen roses on valentine's from my bf. The roses were wide open when he picked them up, 2 days latter all the petals are falling off. Definitely not fresh flowers. Will never purchase from there again. Ordering delivery for Valentine's Day could not have been easier! Can't recommend Olympia Flower enough!\n\nMost people would joke that if you have flowers delivered to significant other on Valentine's, you need to do it at work to make a scene. Right? I was able to quickly and easily schedule delivery for the Back Bay area to my partner's office with simple instructions in the notes of where to drop off.\nOlympia's delivery arrived perfectly timed during a large meeting with another manager bringing them in from the front desk. To me this was absolutely perfect timing on the delivery person's part since I wanted to be able to make a (thoughtful) scene from over on the West Coast today.\n\nBig Thank You to Olympia for an incredibly easy transaction through and through. And she loved the flowers, the surprise delivery, and had only great things to say about the arrangement itself. 10/10 would order again Ordering by phone, staff was so helpful     Filled our order to perfection with the requested flowers and colors and made the specific delivery window.  Will be using Olympia  Flower Store again. Larry and his team continue a decades long tradition of providing amazing arrangements for any occasion.  Pop into the store, see the history of the neighborhood and the store on its walls, chat them up, and place your order.  You won\u2019t be disappointed!  They\u2019re worth every penny! The portion sizes were huge and the food was delicious! I really enjoyed their rice cakes as well as their fried mushrooms. The fish was also tender and flavorful and the beef stir fry was solid. If you want a more authentic Chinese food experience I would highly recommend this spot. Of course, they have Americanized Chinese food too so there\u2019s something for everybody. Service was fast and the atmosphere was great. Perfect for a late night dinner in the winter! \ud83c\udf5c **Yunnan Kitchen Review - Boston** \ud83c\udf5c\n\n\ud83d\udccd Nestled in the South End of Boston at 1721 Washington St #B, Yunnan Kitchen stands out!\ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83e\udd54 **Yunnan Potato Pancake**: A crispy shredded potato masterpiece akin to a French fry pancake.

You won\u2019t be disappointed! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc63 Checked out this place on a Saturday night with a group of friends after discovering it on Boston Eater. Dimly lit with booths and antique-looking decor.\n\nWe ordered quite a few dishes because we were hungry, but the portions were huge (not complaining)! The sticky rice steamed ribs were a unanimous favorite, and the boiled pork in chili oil was a unanimous least favorite. The boiled pork and the boiled fish dishes had way too much peppercorn, which made them difficult to eat because we could not scoop anything without getting a mouthful of peppercorn as well. However, the boiled fish alone was okay. I liked the stir fried rice cakes too because the texture and flavors were nice: it was almost as if you put mochi in a clay pot to get that burnt, chewy/crispy texture. The coconut delight dessert was not too sweet (which was good) but also not memorable.\n\nOverall, I don't think this type of cuisine is for me, but you'll get the bang for your buck, and I had no complaints about the service when I went. Had lunch with my family at Yunnan Kitchen for the first time. Had some good items on the menu. Food was good and flavorful. My daughter loved the chicken stir fry udon which she ate so much. The Xuanwei ham & potato rice was more on the salty side but was complemented great with the Sweet & sour fish fillet! Also tried coconut delight, eight treasure rice pudding, and fried cheese all were delicious and the overall food experience was different with other Chinese restaurant around Boston and it was awesome. We ate here for dinner while touring Boston.  This restaurant was a short walk from our hotel.  It was great.  The food was authentic and well flavored.  My wife tried the \"first kiss\" drink and loved it.  The meals were wonderful and the wait staff took great care of us.  A refreshing change from the Chinese food that I usually run across.  The meals were focused on the meat and flavors with an assortment of great veggies.  You had to ask for rice as an added side (got it for my picky 9 year old).  The meatballs with sticky rice were a wonderful appetizer. Very cozy restaurant with delicious food and very nice staff.\nAlso, they do serve dessert! It's just not on the online menu.\n\nI had the crispy shrimp as an appetizer which was yummy. Three giant shrimp, which we very lightly fried and had a very savory black garlic glaze.\n\nFor dinner I had the bavette steak. This was  very tasty. Steak was perfectly cooked and full of flavor, which also had a delicious red wine sauce.  Steak came with a hashbrown, which was more of a giant delicious french fry.\n\nFor dessert the had a baked Alaska brownie. This was gigantic. Be aware it's mad for two people. This was tasty as well.\n\nI will definitely be coming here again for the delicious food as well as the warm service We've been coming to the Shawmut Inn shortly after they opened and frequently bring neighborhood friends for their first time.  Everyone leaves really impressed and surprised that they had not dropped by sooner.  While the menu is limited...it does not disappoint.  We've tried everything so far and are genuinely wowed by the selections and quality of the food.  Even if you are cautious your first time and order the burger...you'll be back for more.  The chefs are incredible in terms of quality and presentation and the bartenders are acutely skilled at their trade.  The atmosphere is intimate, fun, and refreshing.  A GREAT addition to the many options in the South End.  Well done, Shawmut Inn!! Lovely neighborhood gem\nGreat service\nNice dishes\nShrimp were delicious\nRisotto was a bit odd (too much sauce and seemingly made with regular rice) the vegetable terrine was original however slightly overcooked in my opinion We just had an exceptional meal at the Shawnut Inn.  The vibe is nice, neighborhoody and cosy.  Our service by Michaela was A+,\u2026friendly, informative, attentive and helpful.  She made us feel welcomed and taken care of.  The food was also exceptional.  We started with the shrimp and the mussels.  The shrimp were large, tempura fried with a delicious black garlic aoli.  Simple but elevated.  The mussels were also excellent, served out of the shells in a delicious smooth, rich green curry sauce with perfect toast points.  We also tried the lobster fra diablo pasta, which was very rich, a little spicy and had a great balance of pasta, lobster, Calabrian chili ragu and a little crunch of toasted panko.  Finally we tried the sea bass which was perfectly cooked and was so well balanced with fresh corn pure and some whole kernels.  We felt like everything we tried was thoughtfully prepared by a chef who was talented and experienced.  We live in the neighborhood and are happy to have a new place that makes us want to return.  Well done and congratulations to the whole team.\n\nAdded 9/21/24:\nBeen here 6 more times and tried brunch today.  The quality is outstanding.  Everything was fresh, unique, well-composed in flavor, texture, taste and presentation.  Everything here is somehow familiar while being completely unique.  At brunch we tried the delicious savory shortrib with beef fat hash, the perfectly fresh and well balanced crab Benedict, the unique Johnny cakes,(like an elevated scallion pancake.  The cauliflower rice dish was nice with a little spice and Thai flavor\u2026 and  The waffles were the perfect sweet bite for us to split as a dessert.  Well done chef Quang, server Michaela, and the whole team! Very cozy restaurant with a rotating menu that hits the spot. Love how the kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant! Would absolutely recommend to anyone exploring the south end. Only had a short stay in Boston, but once we discovered this coffee place, we went every day after the initial discovery. Sometimes, twice. The drinks are amazing. The season peach pie chi lattes are amazing. Highly recommend trying it. I also tried the space jam which was also delicious as well as a few others . They even have some boozy options. Overall great experience and coffee options. In Boston's increasingly crowded craft beverage scene, Jaho Coffee Roaster & Wine Bar attempts an ambitious fusion that simultaneously hits and misses the mark, rather like its automatically over sweetened matcha lattes.\n\nThis establishment's identity crisis is both its charm and its challenge. By day, it's a spacious coffee shop with artisanal brews served in Instagram-worthy pink cups adorned with whimsical designs. By night, it transforms into a wine bar complete with craft cocktails and an impressive spirits collection that would make a dedicated mixologist nod in approval. The \"Matchatini\" \u2013 their signature marriage of matcha and martini, epitomizes this dual/multiple personality.\n\nThe space itself is a study in modern industrial-meets-cozy, with soaring ceilings, wooden architectural elements, and pendant lighting that grows more flattering as the sun sets. The refrigerated display case offers an extensive selection ranging from tiramisu to quinoa salads, though one wonders if perhaps a more focused menu might serve better than trying to be all things to all people.\n\nThe coffee program shows promise, with house-roasted beans and skilled baristas, but stumbles on details: that pre-sweetened matcha latte feels like a decision made for operational efficiency rather than customer preference. The wine and spirits selection, however, is thoughtfully curated, suggesting someone behind the scenes really knows their Burgundies from their Bordeaux.\n\nSuggested improvements:\n- Offer unsweetened matcha as the default, with sweetener optional\n- Streamline the food menu to focus on what works best\n- Consider separate day/night ambiance adjustments (lighting, music) to better distinguish the coffee shop from wine bar experience\n- Add table service after 5 PM to match the evening concept\n\nFor now, Jaho remains an intriguing experiment in beverage fusion that's worth watching, particularly after dark, when the club-like atmosphere finally aligns with its ambitious concept. Just remember to specify \"unsweetened\" when ordering that matcha. Such a cute spot! Love all the open tables and bar seating. The screens to self order are great and the staff is pretty nice. Their bubble teas are extremely sweet even if you request it to be less sweet. However the Vietnamese coffee and Scarlett espresso martinis are fantastic and I would definitely go back again for those.\n\nNow for my standard comments. The interior is kept clean and seating is decent. Fabulous establishment. Ordering on the modern kiosks was a breeze. I appreciated their many unique flavor options.\nThe branding / packaging was also exquisite for their hot and cold drink cups.\nThe location had power outlets build into several tables at varying heights. This would be a wonderful location to work remotely, as I witnessed others doing.\nMark the owner was very pleasant - as were the rest of the staff - and shared some insight on the latest batch\u2019s roasts and take home some espresso in bulk.\nDidn\u2019t have a chance to view the bar, but it looked lovely. Would love to return in the future. I recently visited this delightful coffee spot and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of coffee and cocktail options available. The coffee was smooth and rich flavors. I especially loved the cute coffee takeaway cup, adding an extra touch of charm to the experience. Whether you're a coffee aficionado or looking for a unique cocktail, this place has something for everyone."

    "reviews": "Someone died in a restraint here. Also 3 years ago I was a patient and someone tried to kill themselves and the staff new and told him to do it. I went into his room with someone he liked to help talk him out of it. Then the staff redirected us and told us to leave and threatened to call campus police. I'm currently here and the staff are very lazy and they always argue about why they can't do something like make a phone call to the kitchen or to a social worker. It's better than jail that's the excuse I keep telling myself. I hope you enjoyed my review. I have always had family in Massachusettes and therefore came to visit regularly.  After being invited to come and stay with a potential roommate I found myself in a horrible situation and in the FullerMHCtr, drawn into the court by lies.  Although I met weekly w staff and went to most of the groups there were others who didn\u2019t and what\u2019s worse NO One addressed the abuse I suffered at the hands of the police who crushed my wrists, sending me into pain and tears upon entry.  My doctor called it  \u2018mania\u2019 and used that along w a women who attacked me (scratching my face) to improperly diagnose and commit me even though I was the one assaulted by my roommate.  I don\u2019t recommend this place some staff are very unprofessional and I witnessed countless instances of discrimination, staff yelling directly in clients faces while wearing t-shirts that read \u201cHustle or Go Broke \u201c while interacting inappropriately with them. My name is John McGill. I once stayed at Bay View Inn and have been to the CSU. I want so say hi to a few ppl who generally cared for me ! However, my success didn't begin until Solomon Carter Fuller turned their backs on me. Yes my behavior was poor. But what do you expect when you allow a person with a mental disorder to drink and smoke k2 on your property.  Well it's been 2 years. I have graduated a sober house that I am now employed in. I'm living in a awesome apartment.  I live this new lifestyle with much appreciation because  I hold myself accountable for my actions. If your serious about changing lives start there. If your just looking for a paycheck and want to speak down on those less fortunate  morally you are on the same level because what your doing isn't changing lives. I went to their CSS strictly for a mental health crisis. This place caters to chronically homeless addicts and alcoholics. I got very little support from the nurse practitioner, but it was better than doing nothing. The CSU here is horrific literaly go any where else. They gave me someone elses meds when I told them they werent mine and caused me to pass out hit my head and they had to call the ambulance because they gave me the wrong meds. They never even admitted they were wrong. They have never once given me ANY discharge planning. The staff is rude nasty and very uncaring. Do not go to the CSU ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS YOUR INSURANCE MONEY. I did like this insurance. Suddenly in October they inform me they will be canceling my coverage in December. They said to look for a new insurance through SHINE and because of CCA's delayed timing, I am unable to get an appointment before the Open Enrollment ends, leaving me without insurance and any help in obtaining a new plan. All attempts to find new insurance in my own are leading to nowhere. Thanks Commonwealth Care for spending my sense of any security in my life. They do not care about their clients, and I probably won't be able to get any insurance for 2025. Jerks! Commonwealth Card Alliance has been great for me.  They provide me with transportation to and from my doctors appointments.  I also receive 8 rides for non medical.  They check on my well being, come to my home and go over my medicine with me.  I'mhappy with this insurance. I'm on the Care One plan, and these are the benefits that I am receiving:\n\n1 hour massage therapy weekly\nWeekly laundry service (absolutely amazing, they wash, fold and drop it off neatly packaged)\nHomemaker services for 5 hours every week\n8 free rides within 50 miles\nFree same day rides to pharmacy/dispensary\nHome medical care available in a light situation vs going to the ER and sitting in the lobby for 5 and a half months (bad cough, etc)\nShower chair\nFree unlimited medical rides\nI know that the senior plan has gym membership help, and I may be able to be reimbursed for what I paid on a membership.\n\nMy only complaint has ever been with the care partners I've had in the past, and it just took me a while to find one that was happy to help me. Now I have her, and life is so much easier.\n\nBest insurance ever. The app provides very little info to access.  I was unable to resolve communication issue because with their assigned team member - team member never called me.  Faxed document continues to not be acknowledged because they say they can\u2019t find it.  After issue after issue I filled grievance and the final response slanted on a guilt trip on me.  I truly suggest if you are weighing on another plan: do it Extremely abusive staff, medically negligent .\n\nEdit: CCA, do not contact me via phone for this matter. Member services are responsible for this review- I will be formally documenting a proper complaint. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny.

Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. Heard Blunch had the best chocolate chip cookies, so I had to check it out. I can happily report that the Triple Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3.27) truly was the best chocolate chip cookie that I\u2019ve had in Boston. It had the perfect crunchiness all around while still maintaining a slightly chewy center. The chocolate chips were also huge and nicely melted. Also, as heavy as this cookie was, it somehow wasn\u2019t sickly sweet like other dense cookies that I\u2019ve tried. I do think the price is a bit high, but it\u2019s probably for the better that there\u2019s something to stop me from getting this too often.\n\nUnlike other cafes, this place isn\u2019t open on weekends, so plan accordingly. The inside is very small, but people knew not to block the flow of traffic. There is also some outdoor seating.\n\nThere is a $5 minimum for credit cards. Food: \ud83e\udd6a\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nTried \"The Lower East Side\" at Blunch, and it's an absolute winner! Packed with roasted beef, Swiss cheese, horseradish slaw, dill pickles, and fried shallots, all between pressed marbled rye. The combination is mouthwatering, offering a delightful burst of flavors in every bite. I've explored other items on the menu like \"Bird on Fire\" and \"The Giving Tree,\" but nothing compares to \"The Lower East Side.\" It truly stands out as a flavor-packed masterpiece. I mean look at that cheese pull!\nSweet Treat: \ud83c\udf6a\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nDon't miss out on the triple chocolate chip cookie for dessert\u2014it's a delicious treat to round off your meal.

The staff is efficient and ensures your order is served promptly, perfect for those looking for a quick, satisfying meal.\nConvenience Tip: \u23f0\ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\ude0a\nDuring lunch hours, the lines can get long, but here's a tip: ordering ahead on their app is a game-changer. Whether you're in a hurry or simply want to skip the line, the convenience of ordering ahead is worth it.\nOverall Experience: \ud83c\udf74\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nBlunch Boston is a go-to spot for a delicious and hassle-free meal. \"The Lower East Side\" sandwich, in particular, is a must-try for those craving a satisfying mix of flavors. The fast service, the convenience of ordering ahead, and the delightful sweet treat make it a top choice for lunch. At first sight a little cramped but the food makes it all worthwhile. I always order BLT with chicken bagel and I\u2019m never disappointed. So juicy and delicious I want to get another but, I feel full already. Also a bit pricey but still, worth it! Keep it up guys. Food is delicious, staff is friendly, and menu is easy to follow. Had delicious meals there while working in the neighborhood. The best Bfast Eggwich I\u2019ve ever had in my entire Life. I literally bought it took a bite so I can finish it at home. That first bite sent me to heaven. I had to pull over so I can finish and enjoy the rest. I accompanied it with a Triple Hot Chocolate and finished my hot cocoa with a stuffed Caramel Churro. It wasn\u2019t until I had two bites left, that I noticed I hadn\u2019t taken a picture of this amazing meal. I\u2019ll definitely be back. It was so good!!!  This was my first time there, I came in confused but Hungry and Nikki made my experience so much easier. Thanks Again Nikki\u2764\ufe0f"

    "reviews": "Tom was so patient with me. It took me a while to decide if I wanted to invest in an entry light for my 110 year old home. No duh! The result is wonderful. It's so beautiful. Tom packed everything so well and gave me the correct length of support so it hangs exactly where it should with my woodwork. We love this home and the light adds so much joy. Thank you! Very pleasant experience purchasing lighting from Tom. He was polite and knowledgeable and really flexible about appointments as well as delivery options. We came back to buy additional lighting. We would highly recommend working with Tom at Genuine Antique Lighting\u2026worth every cent!! Tom has a wonderful collection and is a pleasure to do business with. I have use them several times for custom lighting needs, over many years. I would highly recommend Genuine Antique Lighting to anyone looking for superior antique lighting products and great customer service. I look forward to needing their services again in the near future. Genuine Antique Lighting and Tom are the best.   I have been purchasing lights from Tom both in person and over the internet for 15+ years.  Everything is as described, and Tom goes out of his way to find the best fixture for each space and adjust anything if needed.  I wouldn't look for antique or vintage lighting anywhere else. Tom and Genuine Antique Lighting are amazing. We are restoring our early 1900's home and Tom has worked with us to find lights and setup. One of our slag glass pieces was damaged during construction and Tom found a replacement for us. Amazing! Affordable for everyone Tom was so patient with me.

Unfortunately I got a disposable vape that just couldn\u2019t work. The staff was fantastic about resolving this issue. They made me feel comfortable And ultimately pointed me in the direction of something much more suitable. Shout out to the staff they always do a fantastic job. And I\u2019ll be back soon. Affinity is the best place for medical patients, I am so happy I found them  First time stopping by today. Great place, really nice staff (Aramis helped me out). Was looking for a new place and will definitely be back. I stopped by yesterday and I was helped by a gentleman named Jay and he\u2019s great. Knew all the products and answered all my questions. Felt like a one man show but he killed it. Definitely gonna be seeing me more often it was a great experience thanks to Jay. Nychole is the coolest bud tender I've ever met. Super respectful and kind and polite. Knows her buds , very professional. She needs a raise n a day off. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny. I think this place is amazing , true American culture , why and how did we not know about the Bobby brand ? I\u2019m so proud that the legacy still stands ! Can\u2019t wait to tell everyone ! Bobby\u2019s From Boston is a vintage treasure trove and a gem to the greater Boston area. Some of my favorite articles in my closet came from Bobby\u2019s and I can\u2019t recommend them enough. Finding a place like this is truly a rare and special experience :) Fantastic clothes. Great prices Worth the wait. Worth the trip. Worth it.  Got a great vintage bomber and pendleton. So much cool stuff, you could spend the whole day! It is a great restaurant on every level. We went there on a snowy night and we had a window table, it was an amazing setting. The food was very delicious and well done, the desserts were great as well. The bread is so special and you can\u2019t get enough of it. The service was very friendly and knowledgeable. It is a nice place for great food and nice ambiance, highly recommended. Honestly I'm 50/50 on how I feel about this establishment. I left feeling full not able to complete my dinner portion. The one cocktail I order was too sweet, but the red wine blend was good. Fresh baked bread was great, appetizers were good, and the creme brulee was expected. Overall atmosphere was cool.\nBucket list restaurant \u2714\nWilling to  try again, yeah. Food was okay. The duck confit was tasty and probably the best dish of the night. The pork chop was slightly overcooked so it's not as tender. Wished the pork chop came with more jus since it was on the dry side. The mussels were great and so was the escargot. Foie gras was a bit on the gamey side. French onion soup tasted good and had a piece of surprise meat inside that made it more hearty. Service was a little slow and not very warm but decent. Atmosphere was good overall. We liked gaslight while we lived in Chicago before. I came here for nice brunch with friend for a baby shower. The customer service was very good, waiter kept coming back refilled my coffee and made sure we all set as we ate our meals. First it came with basket bread with three different kind of bread in it. I got the prefix price which is about $12, it's come with coffee, fresh squeezed juice (orange or grapefruit), and one of the meal. I picked grapefruit juice which is not as bitter as I expected and scrabble eggs which I find it with no flavor. I tried my friend's food which is pretty tasty. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is very decent. It is classic and pretty quiet the time I went. I would say this place is quite romantic for couples but as for views I wouldn\u2019t recommend. Servers are polite and know what they\u2019re doing. The food and the drinks are a bit on the expensive side and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s big plate. My friend and I spent 101 including tip for one salad two entrees and two drinks. I would say that this place is beautiful and lovely. It is a great restaurant on every level.

Their steak pizza is next-level\u2014tender, flavorful meat piled on top of a perfectly baked crust with just the right crunch. The balance of cheese, sauce, and toppings was spot on. The staff was super friendly and the vibe in the place was laid-back but stylish. Whether you\u2019re a steak lover or just a pizza fan looking for something bold, this spot is a must-try. I\u2019ll definitely be back for Great late night eatery that stays open until 3am . I had the grill chicken roll up this time which is like a huge panini because they grill it some to have that crisp bite. It was very good overall. They are many things to choose from on the menu the wings are good also. Their specialty pizza maybe be their highlight. Pizzas are unique and delicious compared to dominos they have a unique flavor, boom boom pizza is a must try(never had that taste before). Surprised to see the large variety of options and they even taste really good. Chicken alfredo Pastha and salads are really really good Hands down the best pizza shop in the area. They are open late, all halal, they often play with pizza flavors for slices, good prices, staff if friendly and always remember their frequent customers, delivery is always quick. I have had several items off their menu, and have not been disappointed yet. Thank you for being the best in the South End! \u2764\ufe0f Best pizza I\u2019ve had in a hot minute - get one of the specialty pizzas and you won\u2019t regret it! The dine in experience leaves something to be desired (tables weren\u2019t very clean), but the pizza outshines all of that. Giant slices of deliciousness for an extremely good price. They say you\u2019re not a true bostonite if you don\u2019t drink Dunkin\u2019s!\n\nAnd that\u2019s so true because the coffee flavours I had at Dunkin\u2019s in Boston, i never found at any other Dunkin\u2019s in the world! This is the best Dunkin\u2019 in Boston! If you come early morning, the staff are always willing to chat and have a smile on their faces. They\u2019ve always made my coffee great!  I recommend ordering on the app to skip the line. Today is 12/30/2022 5:42am and this is by far the worst Dunkin\u2019 Donuts I\u2019ve been to.\nI usually go in the mornings Monday-Friday and the staff is horrible.\nEspecially the tall guy with the dreadlocks. He has zero professionalism. He uses profanity in front of customers, doesn\u2019t know how to make hot chocolate which is the simplest drink there. He dresses as if he just finished rolling dice and he is rude to customers. Next time I go, I\u2019ll snap a picture of that degenerate so I can make another comment and attach his photo. The staff at this location are extremely kind and prompt. Always asking how you day is, clarifying questions about your order, wishing you a good day.  Very uncommon in Boston! But this staff is great Quite possibly best dunks in mass. Staff is so friendly and attentive, great service, and coffee always made to perfection This turkish restaurant is owned by a turkish family. Adnan kebab was delicious, portion was good and atmosphere is like small restaurant. Staff is friendly and the restaurant was busy at night. They have two branches in boston. This one is a smaller one. Though they have almost all the basic turkish menu and the other branch has more variety in the menu. Would love to come again. Ali Baba Restaurant & Cafe, located in Boston's South End, offers a selection of Turkish and Middle Eastern dishes. Diners have praised the flavorful kebabs and freshly baked bread. The restaurant provides a no-frills dining atmosphere and is noted for its halal menu options. Overall, it's recognized as a decent spot for Turkish cuisine in the area.\u200b Ordered the Adana chicken kebab for lunch. The food was good, tasty rice and the pickles were great. The bread was very good and so was the kebab. The kebab was a little over cooked (dried), need some sort of sauce to bump it up a little. Overall, a good experience. Will definitely recommend. The Shepard salad was delicious, however, I paid $7 to add a chicken kebab to the salad, and received these 5 tiny pieces of chicken. Not a great value for $7 on top of the $13 paid for the salad. Came for the kunefe, But the rest of the food was delicious as well! Restaurant is frequented by many of the Muslim locals. Had the red lentil soup chicken kebab and lamb kebab plates. preferred the lamb kebab just out of preference not for any specific reason. But the kunefe was a star. May be too sweet for some, but with the coffee, it is amazing. Atmosphere gets only four stars because it's a bit cramped and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and the bathroom was dirty. Graduated from here last year, great staff. Good values, great atmospher, positive energy. God Bless. I love it Beautiful place for who want to get out of the traffic in the city and relax have a drink and play pool.\n\nThe management and staff is very friendly and I am glad I come by to check that out.\n\nFirst was okay ops just kidding hahaha, very good turkey melt you need to try for sure.\n\nReally the quesadilla need be good too, I thought my fajitas was better\u2026 but not the quesadilla is delicious.\n\nThe joe the bartender is amazing, I will be back.\n\nHave Lucky Today, like always still my favorite bar!\n\nNow I can go to Brazil I love the spot now. I usually go there for karaoke! Huge space, so doesn't feel like you are on top of each other. Drinks are well made, and the service is friendly. It's definitely my pick now above other crowded locations. \ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udf89 Amazing service ! Tried out the chicken Parmesan and was blown away . .  . Food was quite amazing . Good crowd! Why aren\u2019t there more people at this place . Strawberry lemon drop 10/10 The man at the door was super nice. Told him we were there to eat but the kitchen was closed. He told us to go down the street and feel free to bring food we bought back inside. I\u2019ve never experienced that before. We did as he said and he brought us napkins and picked up our mess when we were done. So kind. We had a great time. Stupidest place ever! They did not accept my European ID card and asked for a passport.  Who carries their passport at the age of 30? Ridiculous!!!\n\nP.s i tried other bars in Boston and all of them laughed at me when I said about the passport thing. They accepted my EU id without a problem. Maybe, this establishment should accept the fact that they are racists and hostile against tourists. Such a shame! If you're gonna visit Boston, put JJ's on your to-do list. It's owned by the same family-five gens!-since 1909. It's got great personality, the staff is awesome and the food will surprise you- pleasantly!\nAfter having clam chowder in several different places this week, JJ's was the best. Yeah, I wasn't expecting that either! And if you order fries, get a side of the curry! Then finish it off with the banoffee pie!\nSee Tony! He'll take good care of you! Awesome neighbourhood pub. The staff works as a team, casual service, lots of seating - great food and drinks! Would pop in here again if back in town, felt very welcoming. I was dropping my friend off at the airport, but since her flight was delayed, we decided to grab food and drinks nearby. This was our first time at JJ Foley's Cafe. When we arrived, the table we were seated at was dirty, which wasn\u2019t a great first impression.\n\nI ordered the Blue Lemonade, and my friend had a Long Island Iced Tea. The drinks were decent but not very strong.\n\nFor food, we ordered the wings with buffalo sauce on the side and the duck poutine fries. Unfortunately, the wings were completely unseasoned, tasting like they had just been battered in flour and fried without any seasoning. The duck poutine fries were burnt. While I didn\u2019t want to make a big deal, my friend decided to bring it up with the bartender. His response was dismissive, he said since we had \u201cdug into,\u201d he couldn\u2019t take the dish off the bill, even though we\u2019d only had two bites.\n\nLater, we spoke with the manager and pointed out that the fries were burnt. His response? \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s gravy, to soften the fries.\u201d While he eventually removed the dish from our bill, his attitude was unnecessary and unprofessional. For the rest of our time there, he ignored us, even when we were clearly trying to get his attention to pay the bill.\n\nOverall, the experience left a bad taste in our mouths. A dirty table, lack of attentiveness, and dismissive behavior cost them a star in my book. Spent the day visiting historical sites and pubs. This was by far the best pub along my journey. It is still family run (going on 5th Gen) and extremely friendly and inviting. Prices are good, beer is cold, and atmosphere is great. A little out of the way, but well worth the trip! Stopped in for a bite to eat earlier in the day. I had about 45 minutes to spare and had great steak tips, mashed potatoes and vegetables. It was great! Service was outstanding too and very welcoming. I highly recommend this place to anyone."

Take a look at the name\n\nRichard Myerson lived for this place @ Cinema Management for the 30 Pack of Budweiser.\n\nGod bless Liquor Land a wonderful store with a huge range of products, I was pleasantly surprised that they have my favorite vodka \"KHOR\". I will definitely be back. 1. All you low review people come to the store ONCE, on a bad day for employees, and write your reviews.\n2. Just because the store does not carry or have in stock an item you want does NOT mean the store is lacking. This store carries over 900 different products, and the staff will happily give customers substitutes on products not available.\n3. Some of the staff from these comments are no longer working here.\n4. Don\u2019t visit a store one time, base your review on that ONE experience and make it bad for companies just because you think your 1 star review matters. Not the best location, but awesome place!\nGreat selection of liquors, and some that I can\u2019t find at other places, also good prices. I always stop here when I\u2019m in the area. Really friendly staff, Emmett is a top man, helped me find something I've been looking for ages \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc thanks a million!! The place was very clean, it was my first time coming in for a cup of coffee. My daughter has appointments next door so instead of going to our regular Dunkin\u2019s we figured it was more convenient to go here so we wouldn\u2019t be late. I ordered through the app as I entered, had a seat and waited to see the coffee appear at the pick up section. It was about 2 people ordering in line, they collected their order and others walked in to quickly collect their orders from the pick up section, then it was just me. I saw the employee (Hispanic) walking to the pick up area with a large coffee so I got up and walked towards the counter, before I got close she stared at me, screwed her face up and grabbed the coffee she had just placed down up and yelled \u201cNAME\u201d really loudly. I was confused as to what the issue could have been, I turned my home around to show my name and she just sat it on the counter and stormed off, my daughter noticed this and was confused as well. This employee has a nasty attitude and lacks customer service skills, additional training is needed  8/21/24 @ 9:50am I wish I could give the service more than 5 stars. I've been here a handful of times, and they're always so kind and hustling. They also keep the space clean! Spacious and clean.\nGreat menu selection! I bought a toasted croissant with butter on it and a hot latte with caramel. The croissant was all burned and had lots of butter very greasy and the latte wasn\u2019t a latte wasn\u2019t a coffee and I went back and retuned it and the manager didn\u2019t even care. What a poor customer service. Staff with attitude\nAnd not friendly at all. Like they get forced to work with a mad face and all. I recommend to not go to this dunkin unless it\u2019s a last resort place the manager really made fun of me for having a disability. She was making me pay for whip cream ok and also didn\u2019t even let me add whip cream after I told her I could give her the 50 cents. She didn\u2019t have a nice attitude and didn\u2019t tell me have a nice day. She has the audacity to hurt someone\u2019s feelings and don\u2019t even feel bad she did it. And then they almost forgot my muffin I paid for. I hope everyone sees this on here as well. The only thing that I was happy about was the gentleman employee understood me and he made the coffees really good and he grabbed my muffin cause the manager forgot. Stopped in today while visiting the Boston area from Jersey. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but I was totally blown away by the interior and friendliness of the staff. This has to be one of the coolest coffee shops that I\u2019ve ever seen. You can chill and relax in the cafe, or you can tour the garage where classic $70,000 bikes are worked on in real time. Will definitely be visiting again the next time in the Boston area! I went to Mad house cafe as an out-of-towner with my fianc\u00e9, since we love to frequent little caf\u00e9s Every time we go to different cities. if I was edgy, and the food was delicious. Coffee and lattes awesome and being of Lebanese heritage made it even better (which I didn\u2019t even know going in)! i\u2019m just disappointed that I didn\u2019t get to see the \ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b cat!! Really quaint little cafe with real food and parking out front.  It\u2019s attached to a car shop, which is so cool!  You can sit and sip while you wait!\n\nThe muffin had real blueberries and tasted like it was made with real ingredients.  Haven\u2019t had the cookie yet. Throughly impressed by the unique vibe, great service, and quality lattes! I\u2019d like to see more in the way of warm breakfast food options (totally fine if they\u2019re vegetarian/not American \ud83d\ude0b). They also have a decent collection of board games. Tahini latte w/ oat milk was so good - not too sweet, and very richly seasoned! Madhouse Cafe is a great spot, be prepared to sit back and enjoy with a friend!"

    "reviews": "Many folks don't know about the Goodwill Outlet located on the side of the building! The entrance is a bit hidden: at the end of the parking lot there's a sign with an arrow pointing to an unlabeled brown door which opens into the outlet. They don't charge by the pound like other outlets but most items are priced at a dollar and larger furniture and such are $10 or less. I shared this before awesome people their attitudes helpful if you need it! Good place to shop if you need clothes good quality clothes! I was there today to pick up some flannel shirts I had given a bunch of way to homeless people so I needed some more shirts! \ud83d\ude4f While the establishment offers a wide range of affordable options, it is regrettable to note that the conduct of the employees falls short of professional standards. I observed  employees instances of rudeness, disrespect, and a lack of basic manners, which detracts from the overall experience. It is essential for any service-oriented business to ensure that its staff embodies professionalism and common courtesy in their interactions. Addressing these issues would undoubtedly enhance customer satisfaction and foster a more welcoming environment for all patrons. Affordable, decent clothing and good home finds. I visit Goodwill In states I visit and this one was better than a lot of them I've been to. The only negative part is when I'm with my daughter as black women we get profiled a lot. It happens even in the state I live in. But rest assured. I often make it known, I can pay. The area not bad but like in most states, there were homelessness and pan handlers. Still recommend the Goodwill in this area. I enjoy going to this store because it\u2019s the biggest of the Goodwill Boston locations, but the employees are SO RUDE it leaves the worst impression every time I go. Today I was trying to do the right thing by putting my hangers back on the rack and the one woman quite literally screamed at me for \u201cnot doing it right\u201d when I was just trying to be helpful\u2026.i can understand it being a busy and potentially overwhelming environment to work in but nobody should speak to customers the way the employees at this location do. Great fresh juices for 2.99 in the cold case! Lots of healthy food choices at very approachable prices, nice work folks. Went in to buy an couple of things two of your employees made me feel uncomfortable because they were complaining about the amount of free sauce cups I took I've been taking 5 for years maybe more because they are free ... Smh out a sign than Arrived 6:55p.m. doors locked, no one at registers.  Sign at the door says it closes at 7:00. I just wanted to grab a couple quick things and I would have been out before then. Even this review is done before 7:00 Great deals, super clean and organized, and I like that there are new items to check out each week. This is a great place to shop on a budget. Also, the people who work here are literally the sweetest. I love shopping here! Im not sure what\u2019s going on at this market. I started shopping here last year and the fruits and vegetables were of great quality, however lately it\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m really disappointed. The greens are so wilted and dry and the fruits leave a lot to be desired. I\u2019m not sure if the employees don\u2019t care. It\u2019s not that busy so perhaps if they did a little cleaning out, add a little water to the greens and discard what is non edible. This store could really be a gem to our community. Please bring back the beautiful fruits, veggies you once had. Thank you. I recently hosted an elegant reception for 55 people at Restoration Resources Circa Room. Every guest described the setting as magical, funky, and wonderful. RR provides a truly unique atmosphere. The room was spacious, filled with vintage treasures, an antique bar, and plenty of seating and conversational areas. Bill was very helpful, accommodating, and a pleasure to work with. The caterers, servers, musician, and party planner all agree. I will return, and so ill some of my guests. It's a gem. Our daughter has shopped here for years, and we were lucky enough to use the back room for her Baby Shower.  Bill & Walter bent over backwards to help us make our event a success.  Perfect atmosphere for a cocktail party! Really cool space for events. Email the owner to set up an event in their \"bar/living room\". Tons of space with restored South End and local furnishings. Also, a great place to pick up supplies for your own project. Things are a little pricey but its free to go look around! Couldn't have been less friendly. I read some reviews that said this place was helpful in determining the value of some antique pieces. I just dropped in to see if I could talk with someone about a handwrought piece of sterling silver. The guy behaved like I was bothering him and was saying, \"I don't deal with stuff like that\" before I could even show him the piece. It's fine if they don't \"deal with antique pieces of Sterling silver\", but why should I be treated as if I'm a bother to you before you even know what I'm looking for? I'll never return to Restoration Resources. Was in Boston visiting family and stopped into the shop to browse for some unique, local items to bring back to the west coast.  I was greeted by Walter, who had an incredible amount of knowledge of local history and artifacts.  I also had the pleasure of speaking with the owner Bob, who was very kind and able to help me dig up and purchase a piece of local advertising for my collection.  As an avid antique collector, I can tell you from having visited all of the other \"antique\" shops in Boston (there aren't many), this place is the best."

    "reviews": "It\u2019s not easy to find berbere, teff flour and other Ethiopian ingredients in the Boston area, so I decided to make a 2-hour trek to Ethiopian Market.  Glad I did!  The owner was super helpful and everything was reasonably priced.  Look forward to visiting again soon. I drive 100 miles round trip just for their injera bread. What can I say, this is one of and the only quality store that provides Ethiopian goods. The most popular item on the menu is fresh ingera and meat. Fre and Tade the store owners, are lovely people with positive attitude. They meet the demands and needs of Ethiopian community and others, by providing key ingredients and supplies we wouldn\u2019t find elsewhere! The customer service is like back home, very homey! Do not expect this store to operate like others. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for an Ethiopian store to provide service like convenience store. You gotta get the Ethiopian market experience \ud83d\ude01.\n\nFYI - for those that go to this store and you can\u2019t find injera, know that you can call and reserve based on your needs. This Store is very clean and they have great Ethiopian product. Like Teff \u2026Meat  Coffee\u2026with profeshional customer  service. I recommend for everybody\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 They have just about anything you\u2019d need for Ethiopian cuisine. Great prices I don't know if these reviews are sarcastic or if these people don't know what NY pizza really is.  It's not exactly cheap and it's not great.  It tastes like boring leftover pizza that you heated up in the microwave.  Was it disgusting?   Is it good?  Not really.  Worth $3.50 a slice?  Not at all. Has to be the best Italian place in Boston, certainly Massachusetts, I would argue it\u2019s better than Italy\u2019s own. The ambiance is unmatched, as well the food being cooked to perfection by authentic Italian cooks, all for a very fair price! This is stop is a must if you are looking for exquisite Italian dining in Boston!! Best homemade style empanadas. It's the size of my hand \ud83d\ude04 I had never even seen a shooting star before. 19 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory I had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky.  But then I ate at Ruggles Pizza, and came to realize there were other things to life that can make oneself feel alive again.\n\nIndulging in the culinary offerings of this cheesy goodness was an unequivocally refined experience. The exquisitely crafted pizza, with its impeccable melding of flavors and an artfully baked crust, was nothing short of gastronomic poetry. My eyes, having been dry for 16 years, swelled with tears of overwhelming joy and appreciation for the craft of mankind.  The service exhibited a level of sophistication that is rare to encounter.  The ambiance exuded an understated elegance that elevated the dining affair. I eagerly anticipate my return to savor more of their epicurean delights. Without question, a distinguished five-star establishment, and the highlight of my career at Northeastern.\n\nMaybe Ruggles Pizza was the shooting star I was looking for all along... Pizza was 10/5 and the mozzarella sticks were out of this world (see pic of happy man). Customer service was great, while waiting for a pizza to be made they offered a free slice to eat in the meantime as it was taking a while. W place, long live Ruffles Pizza and Cafe A tad overpriced but good stop for both emergency groceries as well as snacks. Employees are always polite and store is always clean. I used this Hyo atm for the first time and forgot to take the cash. Only option was $20 . I think that is what happened. I was with my friend and I recommend the other convenience store on Tremont for ATM withdrawal which I went to the same hour and got another cash. THIS IS THE Convenience store for last minute or just necessary groceries and a variety of items that has HANDICAPPED  ACCESSIBILITY.... The owner a very humble and courteous gentleman as well as his family are always  helpful, friendly, and assist me almost every day. I prefer  to go to their store and will do so until Closing time if I  need to, I  feel comfortable,  safe and well served by them even when  the store is very busy they will help me. I consider myself to be pretty much outgoing, friendly, and have chats about weather, current events, etc when the store is not busy.  I prefer to go where there is always a smile, a clean environment and good people. They fit my Bill to the T. I've had the worst experience in my entire life here. Faced disrespect and dishonest. Never going to this store again. Worst store that I have seen in my surroundings. Staff is very rude. Don\u2019t choose this store. They\u2019ll take days and days to process your mail at best, at worst they\u2019ll loose it. Packages can sometimes take a couple days to process and even then sometimes they end up misplacing it, requiring them to spend several minutes searching for it when you pick it up. Takes so long to process mail. Packages take days to process and is difficult to track packages because when it says its there, they haven't sorted it yet. This place is an efficient way to pick up mail and often does not have a line dispute the number of students there.

This place is an efficient way to pick up mail and often does not have a line dispute the number of students there. In a hurry.  Stopped for a quick bite but got more than I bargained for.  I ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel with cream cheese and a turkey, egg and cheese hold the egg.\n\nIt was perfect. Most Dunkins that I've frequented, have tossed everything in my bag no matter how many times I request cream cheese to be spread.\n\nWell this Dunkin morning crew is above and beyond.  Mr. Gilbert was tirelessly and flawlessly cleaning everything behind the counter and beyond.  The foot traffic here makes it difficult, however he does a bang up job.\n\nMy sandwich and bagel, which were expertly prepared by Mr. Andrew, had the correct amount of cream cheese and was spread on my toasted bagel appetizingly and the Turkey and cheese melted perfectly within the English Muffin.\n\nLast but not least, the crew was led by Mr. Marvin an absolute professional with consummate listening, customer service and conflict resolution skills.\n\nThis is now my favorite morning spot when I come thru Dudley. I went in with my father, who has a little accent. They were racist directly to his face. The server ignored us for a while then said Lord give me strength while clutching their fists before seeing to us. We had not even said anything at this moment.\n\nWhen we asked how much a dozen donuts cost he quoted 6.99, but charged us 8.99. We also asked for some hot water for my dad's throat, which is sore from cancerous growths. And they didn't say and charged us for a full coffee. When I asked to return it they said they refunded the amount, but it did not go through on the credit card.\n\nOverall I felt disrespected and unsafe. Would not return. Definitely need to make their workers go through training. After 5:30 pm this location doesn't serve cooked food. Friendly service ! The old Dunks was better all these the younger people are rude . I'm thinking on going on yelp and the manager don't do nothing about there workers. When someone gets coffee thrown that's when he will say something mark my words.that dunks should be closed not Melina Cass Dunks. Only gave one star cause I had too.y I was eating here right now and the light-colored Indian girl disrespected me because I was ahead in line and she wanted to serve the people who arrived last, she said bad words to me while I was in the place Most of the food is mid, but the price is some of the cheapest you'll find in Boston. I always go when I'm in the area, though I'd never go out of my way to go to the area. I recommend the General Gao Chicken with fried rice or white rice (you can ask for white rice even though it's not visible). It is by far their best main. If you get a three item combo, you get more of each item. The two item combo is enough food for me, but if you want three, I recommend the fried dough as your third item Hi been coming here for years used to be tasty but....not anymore the orange chicken that some people call general gaos used to be so good stingy on the chicken but the inside was almost black texture chewy yuck! The two chicken skewers were dry like they were there too long! The worst is the egg foo Yong good portion but it had hard white things inside! It wasn't onions that would've been okay! The quality has gone down! People keep talking about how cheap the food costs true but their using cheap low quality food! No thanks! I rather spend more money from J.P. kitchen which by the way also delivers! I go all the time. Soooo good! The rice is very good and food made fresh. The staff is lovely, the food is cheap, beat deals you can get. The location is eh but the food definitely makes up for it. Always used to get Chinese food from The Great Yok, then found Yummy Yummy and was so delighted. This is not a buffet, you can't even sit down to eat here! The prices are good, but since I am visiting Boston I did not want take out. On to the next stop. This restaurant is a no frills, fast food, take out restaurant. The neighborhood is Very Sketchy.If you know Dudley Station you will understand.\nThe benefits of this place is that for $10.50 a plate, you get 4 ( or 5?) selections.And they are generous with their portions. I ordered an Alfredo pizza and a Super Steak Bomb sub for pick up. It was ready in 15 minutes and both tasted great! Definitely gonna come back again! I ordered a BBQ Steak and Ribs dinner and where the hell are these two things?? Charging me $40 for a whole plate of fries and onion rings?? The customer service guy is rude who just hang up my phone call.A  freaking ridiculous place. Horrible i have been ordering from them for years now today was the worse experience. I paid with card the person Read my card out loud at that and tells me it did not go through when on my side it says my card got charged..then proceeded to say the boss said they cant deliver my food because it didnt show on their side when i stated when the drive comes ill show him i got charge but still got a no so i proceeded to say i pay cash but when he gets here i will show him t i got charged and i will not pay twice. When it\u2019s probably their end that is messed up....WHAT HAPPEN TO CUSTOMERS SERVICE...\u201dTHE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT\u201d i will not order from there again They have great food, great prices, and great people. The menu is excellent with a wide array of things to choose from. They have seafood, pizza, barbecue and more. And to go along with their great food selections? The prices.  They are a lot cheaper than other places I have been. And their staff is amazing. They are so friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to others The rudest place I ever been to, I was ordering a drink and this guy was so impatient that he closed the window on my face. If you are looking to buy food around Dudley or Roxbury I definitely don\u2019t recommend this place. Be safe y\u2019all! I got the fries and chicken it taste like this smell of pee and the guy forgot my drink often times when I get out of work I come down to this place and their chicken is amazing They made me new and fresh food in really appreciate them Just wish they would give me brown lettuce on my burgers. Other then that we good Chicken so good it almost brings a tear to my eye I LOVE YALL I don\u2019t typically write bad reviews but loorrrd. I was looking forward to trying this place out because of the good reviews on social media!! Never again!! There was a whole hairball in my food!! I was disgusted!! Such a disappointing experience! I ordered the salt and pepper fish. It looked good; however, there was more batter than fish. Best Chinese Hot food place in Sacramento!\nI love all the food, the workers are kind, patient  and act like your family there..the food is Fresh! You can smell and look at the Freshness.  Chicken chow mein.. with lots of fresh chicken... pork fried rice looks just like the pic.and taste good even for leftovers.. big portions. EGGFOO YON! DAMMM!! BEST EVER! my son ate the gravy by itself..he thought it was Chinese stew.. he loved it.. the EGGFOO YUN!!! SLAP THE CHEF GOOD! Best Chinese food in Sacramento!! I\u2019m so happy I finally found Chinese food that tastes like New York Chinese takeout \ud83e\udd61\ud83e\udd62. My family and I will be a regular from now on. Fantastic food! Lovely staff. It's take out only but I'm good with that. The limited space would make dine in very difficult. No hot chocolate, minimal donuts, customer service was a joke. I'd never stop there again. The workers acted like I need them to be there. The attitudes on them unacceptable, and if I wasn't with my child, I might have been more aggressive towards them because of their attitudes towards me. In the customer service world, you need to act like you want the customer there. You don't need to act like the customers bothering you like you could be doing something better time. Than go do something better with your time. I know I will from now on and it won't be at that dunkin donuts. I go to dunkin' regularly and sometimes I have to go to Ruggles to get anywhere, so I come here. Every single time I come here either the food is poorly made and/or the people serving are rude. They barely get costumers yet they put absolutely no effort into the food. They always run out of something. They gave me an attitude my bus that comes every half an hour was a minute away from arriving and the cashier was being rude never mind the fact my order was right behind her. And even when she gave me my order she didn't give me my full order, I had to remind her and when I did her expression showed that she knew but wanted me to leave after the drink. This branch never had anything apart from the basic donuts. It rarely happens that I get exactly what I asked for. Might as well close down the branch. The person who works there makes absolutely zero effort to get it right. Absolutely the worst dunkin I have ever visited. Im not even sure why this dunkin is still open. Theres about 8 of yall back there and no one taking orders but they are all sitting there having conversations about person things. There was 3 people in line including me. I didnt even get the chance to order cus i was standing there for about 10 min and no one offered to take my order. Its actually quite rediculus because i myself used to work at dunkin for 2 years and id never just look at a customer multiple times and continue my conversation like the customer isnt there. The manager seriously needs to do something because its actually unacceptable. And its sad because its always the people of color giving they own people a bad image. Id rather take my business to the whites because at least they will serve me with respect. This dunkin should be closed because the people there suck and dont have any concept of customer service. MEM tea, Fazenda coffee, fresh salads (mine had mango), tasty sandwiches, and lots of art and passion!\n\nNot a lot of parking, but I was so glad to get to stop in and experience this place!\n\nIt\u2019s also right next to a major bus terminal, so you can come in while you wait and sip or much!\n\nFully accessible.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t come here for cookies to though.  Those didn\u2019t taste like buttery goodness. Came by for the first time for a quick lunch and enjoyed my experience. The space is bright with a variety of seating options. There were people working on laptops as well as just enjoying their food.\n\nI got the Ayanna Bowl and an iced chai latte. Both were made right away. I really enjoyed the flavors of the bowl and the chai had the right balance of spices and sweetness. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area! Nice, cozy place to sip a drink and do some work. Lots of seating and fairly quiet, bakery selection is really tiny but food is pretty good! My friends and I enjoyed a tasty brunch here last week. We walked into the space and were immediately greeted with the smell of bacon...yum yum yum! The space was clean and Covid safe protocols were be followed by everyone!  They have cozy sitting chairs if you want to sit for a short bit. The artwork is also amazing! I will definitely be back to try some of the the lunch menu items. Really nice staff but a very mediocre sandwich. I am not sure if I was handed someone else\u2019s order but I got the new edition that was pretty much just sweet potato in toasted bread, it was missing all the other ingredients."

    "reviews": "I have been to this Dunkin donuts over 100 times. The food has been good not great every single time without nearly a single exception. The best part is the staff and the speed of the workers. They do a great job and deserve recognition because it is busy but never slow. I do order online every single time, which I highly recommend doing. Only issue is some of the crack heads that linger inside but that's a rarity. Every staff here is friendly and give quick service only issue is their donuts are almost 3 dollars. The portion size has been the same since the 90s except for their coffee roll that has gotten way smaller but more expensive. Dunkin is no longer inexpensive Very rude barista. Serviced us with an attitude and kicked us out immediately. Got my order wrong, forgot straws for which I had to reach over the desk due to lack of attention, and we had to eat on the bus bench outside because he kicked us out. Was it because of COVID that they couldn't have people inside maybe? No, because none of them were wearing masks. The bald guy with the painted nails just doesn't seem to like people very much, trash-talks coworker, too. Not giving 1 star just to be generous (at least one of my two orders was right, I guess). Quick and friendly staff. Some of the donuts were out of stock I went to this Dunkin Donuts and the staff that I had her name was Jenny was rude,not paying attention to my order she was to worried about doing illegal things at work she should be fired for sure"

    "reviews": "The host was very kind. Even thought it was fist come first serve, I had put my name down with my friend being late and he continuously checked in and got us seated as soon as he could.\nThe food was great. We got the morning madness which was  amazing, the portions were great with everything cooked well.\nI was left trying to get all the butter off my plate.\nThe atmosphere was busy but cozy. A great brunch spot for any time. Food was excellent! French toast, sausage, corn muffin - all great. Plus a hot cocoa which was perfect!  Husband had the turkey BLTA which he loved.  It was a bit noisy and crowded but the food and service were great. Came in on a Friday morning to get some breakfast. The service is great however my main issue is that the price doesn\u2019t match the payoff for the food here. $15 for scrambled egg plate, $5 iced coffee, $18 dutch baby pancake. The egg plate was pretty standard but really nothing special. The dutch baby I had high hopes for since it was a whopping $18. However, the pancake was soggy, drowning, and over shadowed by the lemon ricotta and blueberry compote which were very good, but I seek a good balance in a dish. The iced caramel crunch coffee was good but too sweet for my personal preference. The hot coffee was just ok. Now something that was unusual was the strangely thin spoon as part of the silverware. The maple syrup on the table is strangely watery as well, lacking the viscosity that most syrups have.\n\nAll in all, the food is still good but not worth going out of your way for, especially for the price. Not sure if I\u2019d come back. It's just a very average place. The corn beef hash was fine, nothing special, same for the morning madness (both feel overly expensive at over $20). The French toast was yummy (but again, $16 for four slices feels unreasonable). The staff was very nice. Just don't see any reason to come back here, so I wouldn't recommend it. Super cute place to get breakfast or brunch (they also have a dinner menu). The prices are really good for the portion sizes. The breakfast potatoes really stood out and are so incredibly good. The vibe of the place is super cute and chill. Went here before I went to the Museum of Fine Arts!"

    "reviews": "I had an amazing experience at Jamaica Mi Hungry! The flavors are authentic, and the food is absolutely delicious. The jerk chicken was perfectly spiced, tender, and full of flavor. The rice and peas were a great complement, and the plantains were perfectly sweet and crispy.\n\nThe staff was friendly, welcoming, and made me feel right at home. If you're looking for a true taste of Jamaica, this is the place to be. Highly recommend! I had three amazing lunches here while I was staying in Roxbury. The portions were large, food delicious, and dining area clean. Would totally recommend to anyone looking for a good value meal! I drove by the restaurant countless times in the past, and could never find parking. So when there was an open parking spot today- I took it and was excited to finally visit the restaurant.\n\nThe interiors are pretty nice although decor is minimal, but seating is comfortable, the bathroom is decent, and it was nice to watch the Olympics on TV while eating.\n\nThe staff is great, diligent and friendly. But they serve the food in disposable plastic trays with disposable utensils even if you dine in, which compromises the experience.\n\nThe portion was too large and the price was too high. Instead of paying $18 for a large portion that I can't finish, I'd rather pay $13 for a good size portion (like a burrito at a taqueria).\n\nThe food is interesting and tasty, albeit somewhat greasy and spicy, Jamaica mi heartburn. And they don't serve water, you have to buy a drink.\n\nOverall- not a great experience, just okay. I first discovered this place from when their food truck was at South Station, but my office moved so I wasn't able to get there anymore \ud83d\ude22\nI soon learned they had a restaurant by Jackson Station. The food is always delicious and I am glad for the vegetarian options...I especially love the veggie and spinach patties \ud83d\ude0b\nService is friendly and there is plenty of seating to dine-in. Today I learned that they're opening another restaurant on Devonshire St downtown. Now they will be closer to my new office...woo-hoo \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe \ud83c\udf7d Horrible Jamaican food I usually don\u2019t give reviews on Jamaican restaurants but omfg these ppl need to do better we had 2 order curry goat white rice, fries, Mac & cheese, jerk pork shoulder but I got stew pork that was stinks  like it was days old I bought it to their attention they switch with curry chicken it still in my air bnb fridge to be thrown out nasty food that wasn\u2019t cook fresh I peppered the food and i still couldn\u2019t eat it smh Good"

Extremely late on the food waited half an hour for a curbside order and eventually had to go through the drive-through. I also do not recommend they forget food a lot. I purchased a filter o fish sandwich, the fish patty was old and hard, as was the strip of cheese, and the bun. I returned it just to get a replacement, WORSE than the  1st one. Hard and old. Food Quality for a MCD's is mostly on par with other locations. Can't expect much when it's Fast Food but....\n\nIt's the Consistency of service here that could use a little work.\n\nThough it's McDonald's the atmosphere here is inconsistent. All depends on who you get the day you walk in.. Some staff are professional and nice but not all.\n\nThe Fries consistently are having to be made while having the patron wait. Fresh is cool and all ,but short staffing is a common theme at this location. Some people here seem to be half in half out depending on their mood for that given day.\n\nSometimes mobile orders that are placed well in advance are not complete by the time of arrival. Sometimes just being started when you walk in. This McDonalds is a joke. Employees are so rude. Never get my order right and then act like I ordered wrong. This morning first thing I ordered were drinks then my food. Get to the window and the woman working tries to say I never ordered them and I couldn't place the order for them at the window! Like seriously? You messed my order up and now your gonna tell me I can't get what I ordered? It wouldn't even be so bad except the fact I had a similar situation a few months ago where they messed my order up and then wouldn't fix it."

The college boast the most excellent professors in and around the Boston area. The office staff are real time professionals and the students are very friendly and easy to get along with. RCC is the college to be if success is your priority!!! Great college my second degree. Just make sure you keep up with business office because several different times never got my financial aid that was due to me as a student over the years of being a student in the past. Great staff and professors Please be aware of this college. Worst college in USA. Took money out from Income Tax return without even attending any class. Please be very aware before you visit this college or sign any papers.My wife went there to check about the courses they provide and see the college. She never went to that college again and never did any class. After couple of months we received a bill that we owe money. Called the college and the front desk said that you have to talk with the billing department. They told us that you have to come to the college and sign the paper. My wife told that her foot is broken and she have 4 kids so that is why she cannot come. She Also told them that she will send doctor and hospital note that she cannot drive.They hung up the phone on her. She sent so many email and calls but no reply. Spoke with billing department that I really need that money for my kids. They guy I spoke said that i can not return the money. Spoke with HR department and they said that we only handle our employees department. Asked them about the dean and they hang up the phone. They don't deserve any star. I am so disappointed with this school. Very unorganized. Every semester I have had a hold placed on my account from issues with the Business and Financial Aid offices. I'm sick of going to the offices assuming that the problem was resolved, only to have something else come up at the end of EVERY semester! I now have another hold and I spoke with the supervisor and she couldn't even find an explanation for me as to why I owe money that they issued me in a check months ago! I hate this school. I feel like the administration is way too unorganized and constantly hinders me from furthering my education. They just refuse to talk properly. I just asked how long will it take my order to reach as it had already been 2 hours since i ordered. It was also not a big order just 2 medium pizzas. The store said that it will take more 15-20 minutes and when asking whether the pizza will still be fresh said deal with it. Lily from 1400 tremont st said they only deliver to addresses less than 1.7 miles away. Thought that was odd. She also gave me a lot of attitude over a question. Anyway, if you\u2019re 1.7 miles away from this location, please don\u2019t bother contacting them :) If I could, I would give this place 0 stars. It took over 2 hours to get my pizza and no one picked up the phone. I was very convinced the store wasn't actually open and ordered a pizza somewhere else.\n\nThis place is TERRIBLE. do NOT order pizza here.\n\nAlso my delivery guy refused to get out of the car and made me wait out in the rain for 30 seconds to get my food. Great food, I LOVE the pan pizza, order is always correct and ready for pickup when the app says. Great value for the price and good rewards.\n\nSometimes staff ignores you for a while after you walk in even if there's like 6 people working...I get they're busy but they could just say \"Hey welcome, we'll be right over\" and all is well, so one star off for service. Can't speak to delivery. Horribleness. This store is crazy, ordered online for cheese bread sticks w/ marinara and garlic butter sauce. A chicken Caesar salad with a pasta carbonara and they called me. First saying they had no chicken for the salad then not having caesar dressing. So I cancelled out the salad and got the boneless chicken with hot sauce. It's 12am guys. Get it together lol . Mind you I was on hold with the associate for like 30 mins while they was trying to figure out how to do there jobs. I got my delivery @130 but the pasta was wrong and no marinara sauce to be found. Smh life. We called to fix there wrongs and around 1:50 got the pasta back correct but now they have no marinara sauce . This is the worst customer service ever . Don't do it. Yah see the hot sauce with the cheese bread sticks . I'm done Went on Saturday evening, great sized portions, delicious flavors. Lamb shank was very tender. There was a little odor in the dining area though If you're a foodie seeking an unforgettable dining experience in Boston, Ashur, a Somali restaurant in the heart of Roxbury, is an absolute must-visit. The moment you step inside, the rich aroma of perfectly spiced dishes welcomes you, hinting at the culinary delight to come.\n\nI enjoyed a generous plate featuring a variety of meats\u2014lamb, goat, and chicken\u2014each cooked to perfection and infused with an array of spices that elevated the flavors to new heights. The rice was a perfect complement, absorbing the flavors beautifully and adding to the overall experience.\n\nThe hospitality at Ashur is second to none. The staff are warm, attentive, and make you feel right at home, enhancing the dining experience. The artful paintings and decor add a unique charm, creating a vibrant and inviting atmosphere. Additionally, the ample parking outside ensures a hassle-free visit, making it convenient for everyone.\n\nAshur restaurant stands out not just for its exceptional food, but also for its inviting atmosphere and top-notch service. Whether you're a local or visiting Boston, this hidden gem in Roxbury is a culinary adventure you won't want to miss. Beef Sambusa with Snapple cost me $6 cash. Try their chai. I ordered lamb shank several times. Absolutely amazing. Highly recommended. Their food taste African and delicious. I visit the area during convention, searched African restaurant near me & Ashur came out. I went to Ashur each day 12mins drive based on the positive online reviews & it was good. I tried the goat meat, lamp & chicken all taste good\ud83d\udc4c.You may be a bit discouraged by the environment but the food tastes good."

His first two years in school were abnormal because of Covid and Zoom classes, so I'll discuss his last 2 years at the Nubian Sq campus of Roxbury Prep.\n\nWe worried he'd not feel comfortable talking to teachers, because he's shy, but, as it turned out, he has been quite involved and has challenged his teachers to explain everything until he understood. They made communication easy and inspired him to work hard and stay focused.\n\nThe faculty, some of whom have worked in admissions at colleges & universities, guided him through the application process and he was ultimately accepted into the elite college of which he'd dreamt. This is a unique level of experience I've never seen in a high school before.\n\nHis teachers are responsive, willing to talk to us whenever, if ever, we have questions. I have the utmost respect for how they've treated my son.\n\nWe are so grateful to his teachers and the administration for the confidence they instilled in him. This is a true college preparatory school. I wish this level of care was available to every student. One of the worst schools i ever gone too. There system is unjust and way too strict . On top of that they gave a lot of demerits for little things like not having your gym shirt tucked in. They say this is the \"High School\" but in all do reality its just like the middle school no doubt about it Excellent faculty! CoaH New Bedford is a great school. The staff is great,  and really cares about their students. It was the best decision we made when my son was entering high school three years ago.

Your kids will be in great hands here. I love the Haynes My daughter loves the center. She learned a lot during the summer. Nice people who are willing to gi the extra mile for you and your family. Very good school"

Always fresh and ready to go!\n\n6/30/19 \u2014 UPDATE: I was craving an empanada so badly and went by around 3:45pm and they were closed .. why say you\u2019re opened until 5pm? Definitely a big bummer! Delicious and friendly! Counter service with a couple of stools, so it's not a sit-down experience. But we were happy to trek there for the ONLY vegan empanadas we could find in all of Boston! Good, fresh food. They've got a wide array of meat, seafood, and vegetable choices and have specials each day as well.  If they don't have your favorite ready, they make it for you right away.  We were also blown away by the variety of fresh juice options as well. Pretty good just be aware that the they only take cash at the store. Twice now I've gotten incorrect/missing orders. Last time I ordered online in hopes of a different outcome.  They literally just throw whatever they want in the bag. & the ones I get are lacking in taste. This used to be the spot but it has gone very down hill. It was nice while it lasted Ordered online, money got taken from my account.  When I arrived they didn\u2019t have anything I ordered available, asked for a refund the guy there did not bother to give a refund kept telling me to cancel the order online because they never accepted it, but there was no way of cancelling it, the man saw this and still said he can\u2019t refund me my 40+ dollars and the tip I left.  Would not recommend ordering online since they like to steal your money."

    "reviews": "I am very happy to share my experience about an unlikely place. When you accidentally went to this place, I honestly did not expect such excellent service, such a range of food and prices, regarding prices, this is a completely different story, I have traveled all over America and in no state will they sell you coffee and a bun with cheese and meat for 5 dollars in the range, the price of this is at least 15. They always have freshly squeezed orange juice, which stands out among many establishments, a good selection of coffee, and also my favorite chicken with salad. Newer spot in town but it is here to stay. They have a lot of homemade pastries. The croissant with ham and cheese was simple and lovely. Cozy interior as well. Really enjoyed my time here. Will be back. I\u2019ve been to this place 3 times this week, that just speaks for itself!! Food and pastries are amazing & affordable. Coffee and matcha tastes great! the staff, cooks and owners are all friendly, we had a small misunderstanding with our food and they went out of their way to make sure we had what we wanted + more and we truly appreciate that! This place has become a staple in my routine & a recommendation for sure \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 Sunny and shining corner window full venue with an authentic but growing menu.\n\nWe keep trying new menus items.\n\nFlat screen tvs, good music system, lots of food options for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert/pastries. Amazing place!\nThe staff is friendly and helpful. Clean with good atmosphere.\nMilhojas Cake is outstanding.\nAll the pastries are beautiful and delicious, and the menu is fantastic, too.\n\nAbsolutely a must eat at establishment!"

My hubby pretty well demolished his bbq chicken (which he says is the best he\u2019s had in years), mac n cheese, and collards before I could snap a good photo. Thank you for awesome conversation, and all the yum \ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd70 Food for the soul, but not for the arteries. I was in the mood for soul food; never tried this place before. I had it delivered, so, I can't speak to the physical location or the behavior of the staff. But, I ordered the meatloaf with beef gravy, collard greens,  and baked mac and cheese. What I got was salt loaf with with salt gravy, salt greens, and salted mac and cheese.  I'm disappointed.  I wanted to like this. I tried to like this. But I can't enjoy the food because it got salted to death. As it's my first time, I don't know if they're always this salty or if this order was an accident.  My advice to them is to watch their sodium levels, and to patrons, to visit them in person and ask for a sample before ordering Ordered a plate on grub hub. Food arrived hot but it was incredibly under seasoned. The mac and cheese was dry. Cant say I would eat here again Update- 2023\nFood is dry! No flavor! Mash potatoes dry- corn flavorless and over cooked- tastes like over cooked canned corn. Beef ribs! Dry and no flavor. Waste of 30.00 dollars.\n\nPlus you have to either double park or keep looking over your shoulders to\nEnsure you don\u2019t get a ticket. ATP just cook at home!\n\nAmazing, I love soul food. I went a few years ago and was turned off at how much garlic they put in everything! It was awful! However I decided to give it a try again! I originally went for the smothered chicken however they were out (they didn\u2019t make a lot of food that day giving it was Xmas eve) so I decided to get the beef ribs(yes beef ribs- so hard to come by considering I\u2019m not a pork eater)\n\nIt was amazing! 10star! I got white rice and gravy and corn! Everything was well seasoned and delicious the ribs were tender and flavored to the bone. It was so good I decided to go back two days later!\n\nThey staff seem to be from the neighborhood which is a plus! Super friendly and kinda catered to me and my two year old  and the owner saved me from getting a ticket! I was super grateful for the experience and even more happy this restaurant is walking distance.\n\n*I would like for you guys to be more consistent with grub hub and Uber eats* \u2764\ufe0f Happy New Years and may god bless your restaurant and staff. The lady who prepared my order was very pleasant. I ordered through Grub Hub. They arrived fast.\nBut, DO NOT ORDER THE STEAK TIPS!!!! They were a cheap cut of chuck beef stewed over rice. I called after to tell I got stewed beef not steak tips, and I did not ask for it over rice. I didn't even order rice\nBEEF BITS, so disappointed! I know my beef, these aren't steak tips\nMeat was dry, macaroni n cheese looked good but Very impressed with the food here! The shredded pork dish with the plantains is the best. I never write reviews but had to give Don\u2019s a shoutout. This Venezuelan place is a true gem! Their food is authentic and tastes amazing. My favorite dishes are the beef Dominican arepa, the beef and cheese cachapa, and their side of sweet plantains. Definitely recommend if you\u2019re looking for a place that serves authentic Venezuelan dishes. I never give reviews but the public needs to know my experience before spending their hard earned money in this establishment.\nIt was terrible service!\nBoth my partner and I ordered food at the same time however he received his plate, hand delivered to our table while my plate was not.\nI was called to the counter 10 minutes later to pick up my own food up, which was sitting there for about 5 minutes before anybody noticed my plate was done. To make matters worse, my food was cold.\nI felt very undermined as a paying costumer and the staff made me feel very bad. I will not recommend this place to anyone. Save your money please. Great Venezuelan food, tried their tequeno and cachapa and both were great. My only issue is the location. There is no parking around, I had to drive around a bit and had to park across the street near a mall and walk back. Great people, amazing food, proud Venezuelans. As a Venezuelan I can say the food tastes exactly how your Abuela makes it. Great service. Definitely recommend. It was amazing I like it keep on going mother caroline academy I hope will forever stand and be brave through tough challenges My daugther attended Mother Caroline Academy My school work has gotten better"

Amazing I have been a kipp parent for over six years and I am pleased that Kipp is not only a place where my kids can learn and grow academically but in all other areas as well. Additionally, I appreciate the sense of community and in my experience feeling welcome and invited to co-author my children's experience.  I am grateful for the staff who are driven and committed to the success of our children as they thrive in and out of the classroom. I dislike this school SEVERELY. My son has only been going to this school 5 months and he will NOT end the school year here. He complains about teachers daily. Some teachers are very rude, immature, and unprofessional. The staff does not take the safety of students seriously. They still have my 5th grade son on the bus with an 8th grader that has threatened his safety multiple times. The teachers target students they don\u2019t like and his science class lacks order. My son has been assaulted by students DAILY. It seems this school doesn\u2019t understand the students they serve. The school does NOT allow my son to call me when he asks and they take his phone when he calls me on his own. . This school isn\u2019t a good school 1. They don\u2019t help kids dig deeper into a topic they are confused about 2. They don\u2019t help stop bullying I was being bullied and when my parents came done they dis anything and when it happened the second time I got in trouble for taking matters into my own hand 3. They give the kids disrespect and expect them to come and be a joyful to the teachers and they yell at kids for the littlest things. They do not help kids do anything they don\u2019t help you apply to high schools when it\u2019s time to the point we\u2019re you miss the deadline. I wouldn\u2019t want to send my kids here this is a terrible school to be at NOBODY NEVER PICKS UP THE PHONE HERE. Ever !!!!!! Always in the office, never picks up. Makes little to no sense Schools water fountain water is grey and the toilet water is yellow..teachers there have no respect for children nor the parents.teachers often try to embarrass students when they get called on. Dress code is to strict can\u2019t wear boots in school even if it\u2019s cold outside.the school does not turn the heat on into deep into the winter time.students barely have free time they have to sit in a hour and a half classes with no break.Give the students the same snack .students should have time to get out of school an come home before the sun goes down with all these kidnappings there need to be a change.by the time the kids get out of school the are exhausted and don\u2019t wanna do after school activity\u2019s . Students often get jumped at there school my kid got jumped by students at kipp"

Great food friendly service and it\u2019s so nice how you can basically order a la carte style. when you basically pick out what you want for pieces. Will return Best seafood platter in town I been coming here since I was 15! I went to the Burke high school around the corner and now I\u2019m 27.  I find myself stopping by for lunch Every time in the area which is Quite often ! The food is great and priced great .  The owner is so kind and there staff . I love it here !\nI know it\u2019s a little eye sore but don\u2019t let that stop you from going inside . There food speaks for itself ! I like their food better than KFC I just wish they would give small packet of butter for the corn on the cob they have. I understand not everyone wants butter on their corn.\n\nOver all the staff has always been friendly to me and provided good service. I go to basketball practice here on Thursdays. It's a great school by the looks of it and has a lot of things most schools don't. It was about to be my first day there so I happy about going so here\u2019s five stars\n\n-love tiara Everyone was so helpful and pleasant. I look forward to my granddaughter attending in September. It a good school I like it and my brother sai hi like it They had a girls group there that was doing great things."

South Bay Mall does have a lot of junkies roaming around since South Hampton street leads down to the clinic so be careful where you park in this mall and DON'T LEAVE anything worth stealing in plain sight locked up in your car. But this SUPER MARKET has whatever you are looking for! I literally Hate this store worst customer service ever nobody ever helps you find anything the store is never stocked properly lines down the isles no cashiers i hope this place burns to the ground i truly do they close the doors 10 mins early every single day it\u2019s holiday time and they won\u2019t let u in that against store policy i hope upper management fixes this i\u2019ve worked for places like riches bros they stay open until the time that is on the sign every day it sucks these big companies flood our poverty filled neighborhoods and do nothing for the community not even a donation to homeless many other stop n shops not this one 2 carriage guys an security standing at front door denying people service 10 mins before closing not cool like i said it\u2019s holiday time it\u2019s not cool i have a family of 6 i hope this place gets shoplifted every day until the go bankrupt i hate stop n shop Instead of making jokes and sitting around open another lame three lanes backed up with 3-5 in each line is stupid you have 13 lanes and can\u2019t be bothered to do your job\nAlso the most disgusting bathrooms I\u2019ve seen\u2026.they had 4 toilets in the women\u2019s room and two where filled to the top over flowing with poop and old toilet paper it smelled awful and thank God I carry wipes to clean the toilet seat so I could use it I\u2019m 7 months pregnant and could not hold it or else I would have\u2026\u2026who runs this place? This is beyond comprehension\u2026..the workers don\u2019t care \u2026.management walks around talking crap about the store loud enough for customers to hear\u2026.they have plenty of security but nothing for taking care of the store who ever is the owner of this store must might as well be a slum lord of grocery stores cause this place is nasty Within South Bay plaza, this Stop & Shop is very well located.  You can come here in public transportation or driving.  They have plenty of parking.\n\n\u2705 Aisles are ample and clean\n\u2705 Shelves were well stocked and organized\n\u2705 be ready for this\u2026.. (drum rolls) \ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\ud83e\udd41\u2026.. they have FRESH lobster \ud83e\udd9e \ud83e\udd24\n\nI agree with the  comment of other reviewers about the homeless people, but I have also noticed some improvement there.\n\nSelf checkout is fast, the machines accept credit, debit, cash and EBT cards! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc they should have more supervisors in that area though as I saw customers that needed support.\n\nI would say they are truly a Stop and Shop. PLEASE UPDATE GOOGLE INFORMATION TO SAY THE STORE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTING PEOPLE AFTER 9:45PM. It is a waste of people\u2019s time to be turned away at the door, when the store says it\u2019s open until 10PM. If you want to enforce this policy, make sure people are aware!! Came to Thoai to get my hair colored red after a long break from coloring my hair. I had some leftover blonde & dead hair but Thoai was super helpful in the consultation. He took into account my hair health, quality as well as mg skin tone & eye color when helping me decide the shade of red to go for. I will be coming back for all of my hair needs!! Photos do not do the results justice! Thoai is an expert and wonderful to work with. He communicated throughout the process so that we could make the best choices for my hair, and his expertise meant that I didn't have to compromise on the results. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Donny is the best person you can find who fully understands the logic behind hair loss and good hairstyle as well as lifestyle. His advices have been excellent for me for both styling and maintaining a healthy hair. It was my first time that I came to T and T Hair Salon for the haircut. My hairdresser is Thoai and my short bob came out better than I expected. You will be in good hand. I will come back again. Always happy with Donny\u2019s work and pleasant personality! He is highly skilled in every way -understands what I want and delivers great results every single time. From the way he applies color, washes your hair, cuts/styles your hair, he is a true professional. Thanks again Donny and see you again! Go to the 7 eleven up the street instead. Otherwise, ask for a receipt if you shop here. As soon as the cashier said it was $16, I knew something was off. I asked for a copy of the receipt and he immediately looked like he knew Cappy\u2019s got caught. Once I brought it back to him, he continued to be evasive and just said \u201cthe machine is automated so I don\u2019t know what the prices are.\u201d It says they close at 11, I went there today at 10:45 and they were closed.. I\u2019m not coming back here they have a huge selection of random goods - including vanilla extract, chocolate chips, hot fudge and dog toys! the staff is also incredibly kind, and always ask if they can give my service dog treats whether or not he\u2019s in his gear. Wonderful Convenience Store and even though it\u2019s a Franchise Store it\u2019s Owned, staffed and run by members who are ALL Family and Very, Very friendly always in a Genuinely Sincerely manner ! Plus they are open 7 days a week including ALL Holidays and carry EVERYTHING ! I LOVE \u2764\ufe0f picking up something/anything in THIS Store when I suddenly discover I NEED something I am out of. Great Store owned, staffed and run by again GENUINELY GOOD HAPPY \ud83d\ude0a PEOPLE !!! The BIG Supermarket Stores could EASILY LEARN MUCH from these NICE PEOPLE & I was a Senior Human Resources Executive for one of BOTH N. AMERICA\u2019S AND S. AMERICA\u2019S LARGEST MOST SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES BUT CAPPY\u2019S IS \u201cOLD SCHOOL\u201d FAMILY FRIENDLY PLUS THEY ARE ALWAYS STOCKED UP AND IT\u2019S CLEAN AS A WHISTLE ! Horrible HORRIBLE people , at least at the one at corner of Oldcanton Road and Lake Harbor in Madison , Mississippi . went in there and nothing but rude people ignoring me at counter, the lady didnt want to double bag my 2  , 6-pack tall cans of beer AND 4 energy drinks in the same bag! i said i at least need it double bagged and they all looked at me and rolled their eyes.  I hate to say this but the guy in front of me was treated very nice and he was black, the 5 behind counter were all black. i am 1/2 Cherokkee 1/2 irish , white but look somewhat mexican , i wonder if they treated me like that cause a lot of blacks down here Hate Mexicans.  but i dont know, was kinda strange, i felt like going off but i held it in. I will never go to the Cappys here in Madison , Ms  again and none of my friends/ family will either, and their friends ! Screw that place In the 7 years I've lived in the Dorchester North neighborhood, this remains the best overall well rounded liquor store. Above average and diverse beer selection. Wide variety of liquors as well, also clean and bright store that's always easy to stroll through. I stop by all the time when I'm picking up at Pantry Pizza across the street. I have lived in the neighborhood for 35 years now and knew the former owner, Ron, who ran a \u2018Tight Ship\u2019 but also was/is an extremely cordial individual and ALWAYS kept the store extremely well stocked with a wonderful selection of Beers, Wines and Hard Liqours while also ALWAYS maintaining extreme cleanliness throughout out the store. Like Ron the new owner is also a very savvy Business Person and very cordial as well. Nick to his credit kept on 2 former employees of Ron\u2019s, Carol and Glenn both longtime neighborhood residents who are extremely adept in their Job responsibilities while always maintaining a very upbeat nature in dealing with the Clientele making your visit to the store always a pleasant one. This applies to the other employees as well who are mostly Nick\u2019s family members and go out of their way to make your shopping there always a pleasant experience. Nick has additionally taken to expanding the interior of the store which while perhaps \u201csmaller\u201d than some Liquor Stores by no means lacks in the variety of all types of choices and in fact now boasts an even greater selection of many, many varieties of \u201cTop Shelf\u201d Liquor an even wider selection of Beers and an impressive selection of fine wines ! It should be noted that at all times Eagle Liqours is very, very well stocked and impressively displayed.In summary you can always count on mostly being able to find what you came in for plus being introduced to other fine beverages and ALWAYS appreciated for your business ! It IS a Retail Store of a time now sadly lacking where you are actually known after a few visits and always welcomed. Good place. Not great prices, but good stock.\n\nClosing and opening times sometimes vary to the disadvantage of the shopper.\n(Close before 11pm, and open way later than 8am).\n\nSlightly below average rating due to all of these attributes combined. Good spot for quick booze. Decent selection of beers and wines. Good liquor section. Sometimes some random shipments of Polish beers are in there. Staff is friendly, if you ask for something they'll see about ordering a case of it for ya for next time. It's the local packie. They've got most of the stuff you need, and usually have a few interesting beers in stock. Nothing overly fancy but fast, friendly, convenient. I don't understand why prices aren't consistent.   One time I  bought a 2 liter bottle of ginger ale for $2.99 and yesterday charged $4.99.  Everything else in there is also overpriced as hell.  Another complaint I have is there one time I  went in to buy lotto tickets and they told me it was too late even though I had a whole hour to buy it...customer service sucks. Unacceptable, ridiculous prices throughout the store. The place smells like stale cigarette smoke. Sometimes it's crowded with rude Keno players. Clerks aren't particularly nice or attentive. (The Dunkins inside is fine) Best convenience store . Open till late , they\u2019ve everything you want . The owner and employees are really friendly. Great staff, great food. They always have my favorites in stocks and I do not know why everyone is saying that no one is wearing masks. I always go here, at least 5 times a week and the staff is always wearing a mask. The owner is very nice and really friendly. I frequent this shop a couple times the week, and someone I believe to be the owner, has even offered to keep a couple favorite grocery items of mine in stock. For the years I've been in the neighborhood, this has been my go-to shop for last minute groceries, Dunkin, and snacks. After COVID-19 subsides, I'll come back in because the staff has been generally wonderful. However, I feel that I MUST warn the public. I went in there today and was appalled at how few people were wearing masks, this in mid July when the rest of the country is surging in cases! Yet there was a crowd of people playing keno and scratch tickets in the corner of the store, only a couple wearing masks as they were all confined around a table. Even the clerks were wearing their masks around their chin, below both their mouth and nose!\n\nI cannot come back into this store, it's just too dangerous. This is a 5 star convenience store otherwise, but right now it's just not worth it. We call them \"Rotary\" in the Northeast, but most Americans call them \"Traffic Circles\" or \"Roundabouts\" Nice! Great service for community! Nice! while a pleasant man, the mechanic owner told me I couldn\u2019t leave my car there more than a day during the ice storm week due to local demand, there was one other car. I was charged 375 to be told that the car had condensation in the oil tank. otherwise he advised it go to dealer at 3 years old. I towed to dealer. 375 is a bit absurd for no solution, no diagnosis, no housing for n lot. We went to Boston for a quick week-ends but ended up with a broken car. They called towing companies for us and then looked at my car. They were super friendly and made the reparations as fast as they could. Thanks for everything!! We are back in Quebec in one piece :-))) Don\u2019t come here for an oil change! It might be cheap and convenient but they totally messed up my car by doing a terrible job with the oil change. i decided to try this place because I\u2019ve had my inspection done here a couple times and it had been a good experience. I brought my car in for an oil change and a tune up. They couldn\u2019t tell me how much it would cost before they assessed what needed to be done for the tune up, which I can understand. I got a call 4 hours later saying it was ready for pick up, so they did all the work without ever telling me how much it would cost. almost $400 later\u2026 $120 for parts, $160 for labor and $80 for an oil change, plus tax. Lesson learned Brought car in a while back for a sticker, was failed for bad control arm. Brought it to my trusted mechanic and was clarified there is nothing wrong with control arm. DO NOT GO HERE Absolutely terrible store. They don't take phone calls anymore and everything is routed to a customer service call center. I purchased an open box item from this store. I purchased it as open box excellent. It was supposed to come in it's original box, it did not, it was shrink wrapped. I thought to myself, no big deal. Well, to my surprise when I removed the shrink wrap, it was NOT in the condition listed. It had several dents around the exterior. The door glass had long scratches and the bezel around the door was scratched. Within the shrink wrap were the turntable, the glass table, screws, manuals, and other items needed for installation. The turntable was broken and several screws were missing that were needed to install the microwave. My father-in-law installed the unit nonetheless.\n\nI tried contacting Best Buy customer support and they said there is nothing they can do since it is an open-box item and the individual stores set the prices. So I went online and got the phone number to the South Bay store and called it. Guess what happened when I did that? The call got routed to a call center for Best Buy. I have been going at this for 2 weeks now trying to get ahold of them. When I asked a rep to connect me to someone who is physically at the store I was told that the store no longer accepts phone calls. WHAT?! How do you expect your customers to get service? I live almost an hour away. I now have to drive there to get this settled. I should not have had to pay for a specific condition and receive an item that does not meet what is listed. Shame on you Best Buy. Best Buy charged me an annual fee, so I called to cancel the card. They assured me it would be canceled, but it wasn\u2019t. Instead, they sent me a bill with interest, and then reported a late payment\u2014damaging my credit score. This is unacceptable and extremely poor service I had the best service this morning by the staff on shift 1st March. One guy in particular (didn\u2019t catch his name) went above and beyond to help me with a SD card requirement. He even called other stores for me. Thank you. I'm currently traveling in Boston and went to the Best Buy to check on gpu prices and found an rx 7900xt for pretty much the same price it was before the gpu shortage, I sat in front of it for a while and then asked someone to take it out of that alarm thing so I could buy it. When I was going to pay for it I found out it was actually 300 dolars more than it was displayed at. I questioned the price and the guy just said they \"probably put it in the wrong spot\" but it was in one of those glass displays that only people that work at best buy can open it so IF it was in the wrong spot then it was THEIR fault... Anyways, they took the hope away from me in a matter of seconds. Definitely wouldn't recommend This store is a disaster. The staff is rude, unhelpful, and clueless about their own products. I called ahead to confirm an item was in stock, only to arrive and be told they never had it\u2014no apology, just attitude. Employees give inconsistent, incorrect information, and checkout is slow and disorganized. No one values your time or business here. Take your money elsewhere! I EXPERIENCED RACISM!!! First of all, the store is terrible! You wait for the locks to open for the product you want to buy and they never come to help. You have to give your hours to buy a product. The products are never replenished. They have a Greek cashier and this man was constantly rude and snide towards me and my wife because I am Turkish. He called us \u2018stealing\u2019\u2026 (While they were the ones who stole our food from the Turkish kitchen \ud83d\ude00) Even though I was a customer, he was never polite as an employee. We tried to talk him down and remained silent about what he said but he did the same thing the next time we came. We told another employee about this and wanted to complain but no one cared. DISGRACE!!! You employ racist people Target Great variety and generally kept clean and organized, however, everything is locked up. The alerting system to get an employee to open up the locked cabinets either do not work or there is seemingly no one to receive the notification \u2014 requiring a significant amount of time trying to track down the responsible employee to purchase the item. The removal of self-checkout has added to this pain, with the end result of a quick Target trip becoming painstakingly long and frustrating. I'm not going to leave a bad review. Are the products that are commonly stolen locked up, yes. They don't have self checkout anymore because of theft. It's not in a great area, and there's a lot of homeless and people struggling with addiction around. With all that said, the store is actually pretty good. I'm usually there a couple of times a month. All I can say is, pack your patience and remember, you're in the city, not the burbs I am surprised by all the recent bad reviews.  I don\u2019t live in Boston, but I come here at least 6 times a year and I truly enjoy coming to this store! Good Lightning, ample aisles and well stocked.  I must admit that during COVID time there were empty shelves, however, as of March 2022, that is not the case as you may see in my pictures.\n\nEach time I come here there are merchandising staff organizing and replenishing the shelves.  You can find clothes for all sizes (petite and plus included) with a very good selection and good prices.\n\nMy most favourite is the Home department.  Lots of options, even though not too many decorative pillows.\n\nThere is a CVS and a Starbucks in- store so, very convenient for a multi-shopping experience. Everything is locked up and it's nearly impossible to find an employee to open the glass so you can get what you need. They have also closed down self-checkout so what would have been a 20 minute Target run turns into at least an hour. If you have to use the restroom, forget about that; they closed the public restrooms and only opened them up when the city forced them to, however you need to find an employee to open the one restroom for you as well, so good luck with that. They also allow people with dogs to roam the stores, and there was literal dog waste on the floor. I love Target, but this location is a nightmare. Avoid it if you can. I don't know how Metro goes about it's hiring of personnel there is always a vast possible difference with employees. At this particular branch here are a couple of people who are extremely nice and knowledgeable which is what you really need. Another location an employee once called me stupid, which at times is quite possible, but at this particular time it wasn't true and I found it really nervy for an employee to call a customer stupid I am far from stupid. You take what you get with Metro as I said there are some very nice people there who are knowledgeable and helpful. Last week I was overcharged on a phone I purchased the young immature girl overcharged me by $100.00 and assumed I wouldn't check the actual price of the phone online , customer care also checked the price on their end and they were upset they said they will be addressing the issue and changes will be made this place is a scammers dream and she basically pocketed my money I was given credit for what she did but that place gotta go or they need to put the right type of people over there people in the store are just as bas as the junkies outside of the store I'll never go there again. Maybe it was just a bad day I don't know but the two Bops at the South Bay location are very Rude. Especially the one with Blonde ramen noodle hair. Don't patron this Metro PCS ... Seriously wish the location on Bowdoin never closed. Edit:  having spoken with T-Mobile support twice since visiting with this store a few weeks ago, the staff at this location need some serious re-training.  She sounded smart - but she didn't have a clue what she was talking about.\n\nI went on the website and was given a 0-minute wait time.  I went into the store and was told 30 minutes - or I could come back another day when they \"actually have people staff.\" (??)  There were 3 or 4 reps standing around, talking to each other.  One HOUR later, someone was able to assist me.  She said I could I not see the phone I wanted to purchase in person - instead I could look at the picture on the wall.  For a $1,000 purchase, I should look at the picture on the wall if I want to see what it looks like?  After I purchased, she asked if I wanted to see it.  Wow!  She essentially rushed me out of there in 5 minutes after I waited an HOUR, after being told I'd be helped within 30 minutes. Then she told me I could call T-Mobile when I left and get my activation charge removed, given my circumstances.  I called T-Mobile and the phone-rep told me she could've just removed it in-store and she was really confused why the rep told me I had to call.  And when I got my bill?  A $30 protection add-on that I specifically told the her I did NOT want.  So now I have to call T-Mobile again because spending an HOUR at this store created more problems than solutions.  Terrible management. DO NOT GO THERE WORSE SERVICE EVER\nI'm MetroPCS customer for almost all my stay in US which is 2 years.\nMy phone battery is running off very quickly and I need to change my phone I am ready to pay 600 to 700 for iPhone or Samsung and I'm desperate to get one tonight because my business is 100% through phone\nI came around 15 to 20 min before closure which is fairly enough to change my phone as I'm not new customer\nWhen I entered he asked what brings you here just in unwelcoming way!!  And said sorry I can't do that simply\nWhere is good customer service? ??\nNothing I'm really frustrated and thinking seriously change to another carrier.\n\nBad customer service\nThis is not the way to treat your loyal customers.. Place is always broken, ATM is out of order, door doesn\u2019t open because the card reader is messed up. This ATM is worse than a McDonald\u2019s Ice cream machine. Good location, next to Best Buy & Sprint I had the most amazing experience at Mattress Firm in South Bay, all thanks to Sunni! From the moment I walked in, she gave me the warmest welcome and made me feel truly cared for. I was searching for the perfect mattress for my father, who has suffered a stroke, and Sunni went above and beyond to help me find the best option within my budget. Her kindness, patience, and genuine desire to help made this experience the highlight of my day. The world needs more people like Sunni, and Mattress Firm in South Bay is incredibly lucky to have her! Thank you, Sunni, for your compassion and outstanding service! Sunshine our salesperson rather matress expert listened was helpful and patient. She answered all our questions and adjusted what she had us try. In the end we were pleased and excited with our purchase. Can\u2019t wait to sleep better I Love the good vibes Valerie has she was very good explaining to me on the sales they have she really help me a lot especially the day they was doing the delivery one of her employees call her to let them know was on a 5th floor, in my opinion I\u2019ll give 100% the thrust on this mattress since I got them my back problems start to heal and they are really comfortable. Fully Recommended Mattress Firm \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc thank you so much Sunni was great and helped me get in, get out, with the perfect mattress and not have to give any of my hard earned $ to the Amazonian oligarchy. Literally one hour from needing a mattress to having a mattress in a box in the trunk of my car. Win all around. I will certainly be back next time I need a mattress! Recently, my partner and I decided we wanted to upgrade from a Full Bed we got from Amazon three years ago to a high-quality King size bed.\n\nGetting a bit ahead of ourselves we went to IKEA that same day and purchased a King Size bedframe with zero plans whatsoever on how to get a mattress yet, leaving us with a Full mattress sitting on our amazing new King bedframe. We purchased a mattress from one of the big online mattress in a box companies and were promised by their support delivery in two days. Two days come and go, and we are sent an email that the mattress has been delayed, and it will be at least a week to receive it with no solid or confirmed new date.\n\nWe started to look online for mattress stores we could visit in person, or other online options with a more concrete delivery timeline, and saw that there was a Mattress Firm within 10 minutes of our apartment. Being where it is located, we did not have super high hopes for our experience, but boy were we wrong.\n\nThe morning of our purchase I visited the store with my friend to do some scouting work, and was greeted by Carolina right away! She asked some questions about me and my partners sleeping habits and preferences as well as price range, and started to show us some options and let us know most things could be delivered within two days by their team with a solid, confirmed delivery date. I let her know I would be coming back later that day with my partner to make a decision together and finalize the purchase, and she helped us make a reservation with a $50 deposit for my top pick so far, and let us know that when we returned, she would be gone for the day, but another employee, Kevin, would be there to help us.\n\nWhen my partner and I returned, Kevin was with a customer but immediately greeted us and let us know he would be free for us as soon as he was done with his current customer. Unfortunately due to reasons completely outside Kevin's control, his interaction took much longer than expected but he kept us updated and was apologetic the entire time.\n\nOnce Kevin was free, he looked over what Carolina had picked out with us, as she had made sure to let him know that we would be back - amazing customer service and seamless transition between employees - no worries about fighting over a sale or for a commission.\n\nWe talked about the delivery dates and determined we did not want to wait until one of us would for sure be at home to be able to receive the delivery, but no problem, because there were mattresses in a box from the store brand Sleepy's ready to go!\n\nMy partner and I tried all the Sleepy's mattresses available, and found one that blew us away for the price and convenience of getting it the same day. Kevin helped us finalize the sale and get approved to use the no interest financing option, and they even had the sheet set and mattress protector we were hoping to get in stock to leave with that night as well.\n\nAs we finalized the sale, Kevin was able to find savings for us to make up for the inconvenience of waiting, which helped a ton as we were getting the mattress, sheet set, mattress protector, and the 10 year protection plan. He then grabbed a cart and brought everything down to the door in the elevator for us, and even loaded it in the car when we pulled up.\n\nOverall, this was an amazing experience, and I would have absolutely no reservations to send anyone I know looking for a mattress of any size and price point to Kevin or Carolina, who should both be recognized immensely by management for their amazing service and representation of the Mattress Firm brand. Great selection of clothes to choose from with very affordable prices! I came here to buy a dress shirt and they had a great selection! The shirt only cost $20! I recommend going anytime but in between season, that\u2019s when they put most of their clothes on a big discount. Staff was also very kind and friendly. Would recommend! I went to buy a coat and was help by one of the service  person Elisabeth  great job with finding  what I need thank you Always a good experience. Helpful employees. I always find something I'm looking for or similar. Great location. Found some cute sling backs. Waited in line a while tho and it wasn\u2019t long they need more cashiers. Had a better selection before COVID, shoe selection is very dull now. But all Marshalls you will find deals. This isn't my favorite Marshalls by any means. Dumpster fire of an Old Navy. I did find a couple of cheap items, but that was only after pawing through literal mounds of clothing. Worst mess I've seen in an ON, and I've been to a lot. Also understaffed (clearly), and the limited staff was rude. I like Old Navy as a franchise but I couldn\u2019t even get into this one. The employees locked the doors 15 minutes before closing and were seen sitting together on their phones. Seems like other reviewers have had similar experiences with poor customer service interactions. This old navy is awful. The fitting room associate working at 7pm acted extremely rude towards me. Will try to avoid this one moving forward I had great assistance with the young ladies who work there, one I had to model for me to get a ideal the right size to get for my daughter,  the 1st lady asked her opinion what color should I get because the tie dye in blue I grabbed and she said being a younger woman than myself she preferred the blue \ud83d\udc99 one so I got it. The lady at the register gave me someone helpful tips and ask me if I like to apply for card and I got old navy \ud83d\ude43 card and discount on my products, she smiled \u263a had excellent customer service like the other 2 young ladies \ud83d\udeba.  I would recommend people to run \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f down to this old navy today. I know I will today it's worth it. I even got a few things for a family member as a gift \ud83c\udf81 and they enjoyed it \ud83d\ude42. Great prices on everyday wear, always a sale and a bargain, good customer service, lots of parking right in front of the store. It is well organized and I was able to find everything.\nHowever the staff is a real \"mix \"...\n1 was working with a lollipop, completely bored; 1 was acting as if she was working, shovelling waste under shelves instead of taking it away and walking around without doing anything; 2 at the register were in a discussion about their working positions, completely forgetting about the customers present (so no hello and goodbye e.g).\nI will come back for the bargains but the personnel there is kinda \"special\". Trash experience. Customers can't get into bathrooms without staff assistance, and staff are roaming around aimlessly yet unable to assist. Crap selection for clothes anyway. Won't be back. Keep your ghetto experience. The worst manager of all. April, the person in charge, couldn't care less about her customers. It's incredible that she holds a higher position than the girls working at the cash register they are much kinder and more helpful. I had a terrible experience today... I wanted to buy a product that had to be paid for at the front of the register, and when I went to pay, the girls lost sight of my product. The manager's only response was \"sorry,\" and she didn't even make any effort to look for it. Apparently, they don't care about sales, since a product worth over $120 must be nothing to them!\n\nNever again! TjMaxx is a good store with everything at a good price but the employees don't make the customer comfortable. He walks after customers as if they were going to steal. It's not common for everyone to come into the store and steal. Leave people at ease in the store and if they get upset there are cameras and security at the door to protect the store's items.. Great location. Great store for shopping items at reduced prices. There\u2019s the men, women, junior and baby sections. There is something for everyone.\n\nParking is available. Cash and card transactions allowed. Overall I was disappointed with this experience. I placed a pickup order and was told it would be 15 minutes at 1252. I didn't leave the store until 130 ish after arriving in 15 minutes. The cheesy garlic bread was okay but pretty bland, same with the chicken on the chicken bacon ranch fries. The wings were good but overall the food was good not great. The portion sizes are nice though. Just ordered from Pantry for the first time.  I was not impressed.  I ordered the Greco Pizza and a slice of Carrot Cake.  The pizza is not very good.  The crust is very bland, and tough.  I ordered directly from the restaurant, and when the pizza arrived it was all ready Luke warm.  The cheese portion was generous, but again, no flavor.  The spinach had an odd taste, the canned olives are what you expect, and the chicken was OK.  I think there was supposed to be feta on the pizza, if it was it was more bland then the Mozzarella.   The carrot cake had a hint of carrot cake flavor, and the frosting was good.  I would not recommend pizza from here, especially when the area has many other terrific pizza options. We've been ordering takeout from Pantry Pizza since it opened many years ago, mostly pizza and subs. We always enjoyed the food and quick delivery. But tonight I ordered a Greek salad. It was UNBELIEVABLE! It was huge. The 9\" round container was filled to the brim. It contained fresh mixed greens, a whole cut tomato, 3 plump pepperoncini, crisp red onions, green peppers, Greek olives and a pile of feta cheese. The delicious dressing was in a separate container so the salad did not get soggy. It also came with an ample piece of pita bread. All for about $11. Highly recommend! Very unfriendly customer service! We made a phone order. The lady sounded very annoyed when we wanted to double check the items and how much it costed. She even whispered \u201cOh my God!\u201d on the phone. We have ordered from Pantry so many times and loved it, but this kind of servicing is losing your customers. Avoid this place. The bread on my turkey club sandwich was stale, which made the toast hard as bricks.. I told the cashier and he denied the bread was stale. So I asked for (un) toasted bread. He brought 3 slices of bread out to me and naturally the bread broke apart which I showed him to prove it was stale bread. He never offered anything to address the issue. I would avoid this place at all costs. Came for dinner with my lil family. It was not busy, this was around 4:30p. It\u2019s Applebees, not much to say. Food is good & so are the drinks \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe Went to this location today for dinner and gave specific instructions regarding food allergies and requested ingredients be left off items. Staff completely ignored instructions and food arrived with restricted ingredients. Requested food be remade but was not. They simply picked out the restricted ingredients and put in a new dish. Horrible customer service and attention to important details. Nobody from management visited the table or cared enough to check in with us. Such a wonderful place! The deals are excellent and the food is quite delicious. This is a go-to place for me, and I intend on coming back many times! I visited this Applebees in Fall 2024, having the sharing platter as a main with a red sangria.  The positives:  food was good, portions plentiful and the sangria top notch. My server, Rachel, was also really pleasant and helpful. The challenge for a Friday night was the uncoordinated approach to managing the volume of customers, leading to delays from the hostess, bar and kitchen across the board. No deal breakers but you should be prepared to wait unnecessarily if they have volume. The food and service was good. We waited a bit to get our check taken care of, but that seems to be the case at quite a few establishments.\nNothing to write home about. Fast friendly and elegant a nice quant dunks that says hey we love our customers and a baker that knows how to make the donuts amazingly! And a management team that reminds me but also looks like a classmates of mine from Argosy University online class of 2016s criminal jusrice degree class' parents of sadia fayazz's mom and dad! I usually just get coffee from Dunkin\u2019 but was a little hungry so I grabbed a ham and cheese grill melt. The picture looked appealing but when I arrive home the bread wasn\u2019t even placed in the same direction there was hardly any cheese and only one scrawny piece of ham out to the side of the sandwich. To make it worst the sandwich wasn\u2019t even grilled and just warmed. I\u2019m basically eating warm bread smh.\n\nThe staff were friendly but man the sandwich just sucked. This establishment would be greater if the manager didn\u2019t employ people with poor customer service skills. The employee in the morning with the big eyes and small head that makes the coffee is childish! She may be the managers wife. For some odd reason she always pronounces my order name incorrectly ( literally 2 letters) and holds the order behind the counter to force an interaction, Very weird behavior! The Dunkin\u2019s on the end of the street at new kids on the block corner store is 10000% better and their food and drinks are higher quality and they\u2019re the sweetest! Half the store is closed, the cashier didn't seem to know what was going on and the donuts were cold. I had a 1/2 donuts delivered 2 out of 6 Donuts fresh the other ones stale and hard which were jelly, old fashioned and powdered sugar the 2 Boston cream donuts was fresh also the midnight coffee no cream  wasn't fresh u can tell it was sitting a long time it wasn't even hot I don't think they sell a lot of  this particular flavor I recommend this Dunkin before 8:30A in order to get fresh food If you\u2019re in the Dorchester area and looking for a cozy dining spot with a welcoming ambiance, The Pearl is a great choice. Although the space is small with limited seating, the warm and inviting atmosphere makes it feel intimate and relaxed. The customer service stands out; the staff is attentive, friendly, and quick to ensure you have a positive experience.\n\nOne of the highlights at The Pearl is their impressive selection of alcoholic beverages. The drinks are not only affordable but also well-crafted, making it a fantastic spot to unwind. Whether you\u2019re stopping in for breakfast, brunch, or lunch, you\u2019re in for a treat. The food is flavorful, well-prepared, and satisfying perfect for a casual dining experience. It\u2019s more southern homemade dishes!\n\nLocated in a lively area surrounded by shopping outlets, coffee shops, and entertainment spots, The Pearl is ideally situated for a fun day out. You can easily grab a cup of coffee, catch a movie, or indulge in some ice cream before or after your meal, adding to the overall experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re seeking a charming, budget-friendly spot with delicious food and great drinks in Dorchester, The Pearl is well worth a visit. I  visited this charming, small restaurant with a friend this past weekend. it was exactly the cozy atmosphere we were hoping for. From the moment we walked in, the owner was incredibly accommodating. I asked if they could turn on the TV to watch the Celtics game, and without hesitation, the owner made it happen\u2014talk about excellent service!\n\nWe ordered a variety of appetizers: Truffle Fries, Wings, Crab Dip, and Shrimp. Everything was absolutely delicious! I was a bit skeptical about the Truffle Fries, having had disappointing experiences elsewhere, but the bartender reassured me that these were different. She was right! The Pearl Truffle Fries were to die for\u2014crisp, flavorful, and truly unique. Huge shoutout to the bartender who made my night; she was amazing, and I wish I had caught her name. HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY BTW!\n\nIf you're looking for a cozy, intimate spot for a date or even a fun girls\u2019 night out for some great conversation and tasty food, I highly recommend this place! The only reason I\u2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that we didn\u2019t try any of the entrees, but I\u2019m definitely looking forward to coming back to sample more of the menu.\n\nOh, and the drinks? They were fantastic too! Highly recommend this place for a laid-back yet satisfying experience. I'm going to tell you like I see it, entering the location, felt like I was walking into an oversized bathroom with mirrors to make it look bigger than what it really is.  The female hostess, was truly doing the mostess while sitting at the bar, on her phone & laptop, not acknowledging us.  The food, Got damn, $5.00 per wing, and 7 wings per serving DAMN!!! Tariffs or Greed you pick.\n\nDrinks, well let's just say, we still waiting on them, my girl says her expresso martini was on point, and my water was on point Traveling to Boston for the first time from the South for business. I tried the Lobster roll. It was so tender! The Pearl Potion was my drink. Dee was my amazing bartender. I will be returning again I really appreciate that the parking is free, and I find the space to be comfortable. The staff is very helpful, which adds to the positive experience. However, I think the menu could use some additions. I ordered the steak tips cooked well done, but they arrived medium rare. Fortunately, the seasoning made up for it. My drink was a apple cider martini was delicious, and I highly recommend trying it. The prices are more than reasonable, especially for that area. With free parking and such affordable prices, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys going out without spending a lot. Was a really close walk from where we were staying and the ambience was really nice! We ordered an extra hot cappuccino, it was definitely extra hot but it was more of a latte. Server was really nice as well. I paid $5.80 for a steamed milk with some syrup. No coffee. Just steamed milk and a bit of syrup. It was average size. Nothing large! It was nice. But I actually could not get over the price. More expensive than any other drink on their menu and when I checked with the server she said it was because they charged it as a latte. Still - $5.80?!!!! For just milk and syrup.  I\u2019ve never paid that much at Starbucks or anywhere! (I do appreciate the owners feed back below. Correct, nothing on the menu is that much which is why I checked. There were two ladies, one seemed very experienced but she just said that was the price \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.) Just moved down the street from Sugarbowl. Was super excited to try this place since it's only a 3 minute walk from my home. Unfortunately, I was really let down by this place. We paid close to $30 dollars for 2 sandwiches and 2 coffees. Par for the course, but when you dish that much out for a coffee and a sando, you expect it to be at least decent. We both got extra shots of espresso in our lattes, and they were so weak that we couldn't even taste the coffee. It was like drinking pure iced milk.\n\nAlso, while we were waiting for our sandwiches, the whole restaurant started to fill up with smoke because one of the staff members must have burnt some bread. No biggie, mistakes happen. Unfortunately, the burnt bread that filled up the restaurant with smoke ended up on our sandwiches. I made a joke to my partner \"watch, that burnt bread is our sandwiches.\" Sure enough, my joke was accurate.\n\nThe staff was friendly and the service was good, aside from the bland coffee and burnt sandwiches. Maybe they were having an off day today, so maybe I will give them another try in the future. I've been here several times because I live down the street. The biggest issue is they seem to be understaffed...every time I go it takes a really long time for even the most basic orders. A bagel toasted with cream cheese took 25 minutes, and that was after standing in line 15 minutes to order!\n\nThe coffee and breakfast sandwiches / bagels are ok, but definitely do not seem fresh baked or anything. It's a shame because the place has so much potential as a lovely local spot and I'd rather support them than the Dunkin across the street. But please hire some help! The barista black hair is kind of racist with the Latinos. I wouldn't come back. I'm a resident and I pay taxes I do not live from the government. I just wanted to buy a coffee here but with her attitude and the side eye, I prefer to spend my money somewhere else. The coffee isn't great. R: that she is a \"descent\" means nothing with her attitude and that doesn't prevent to someone to be racist I had to take my little kid to the bathroom (she's in a rush to use it) and to grab a drink for my wife. When I asked for a code the staff told me i have to make a purchase first and that's a strict policy. That's fine then i had to wait in a line but still I asked for a code for my kid to use bathroom while I'm waiting in the line. Surprisingly i wad told NO Again because i have not purchased anything! What a rediculous policy leading to kids accident! What a shame! Of course i didn't make any purchase since i have to find somewhere else for my kid. Screw my willing to purchase anything here! Very Very Bad! A policy that forbids kids using bathroom When They are in a rush is a joke, especially i was in a long line waiting. I rarely post comments on other stores but this is the one making me change my policy! Worst Starbucks in the entire world. If I could give it 0, I won\u2019t give it 1.\n\nWe were planning to order a drink, line was pretty long. Asked the staff for a bathroom use first for our 8 yo daughter. Staff refused us to use it. Of course, we didn\u2019t order anything in the end either. Who would do that in such a bad servicing situation?\n\nStarbucks should investigate if this store has the permit and proper training to be a part of the chain. Such a shame having this kind of service from Starbucks. This is my fourth time and I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but every time I come to this location, the incompetence by the staff just kills me. You don\u2019t watch your services. Don\u2019t watch them pick up line people stealing peoples food and you guys don\u2019t even know it. You don\u2019t prioritize people whose food been taken. I sat here and wasted 15 minutes that I can\u2019t get back for food that I ordered 20 minutes ago. You guys need to do better at this location. I\u2019m over it. I got a cod expresso with three sugars instead of some white mocha. I got the same white mocha for the second time, but then it was either an expresso, of course, without sugar. I asked for the key to the toilet. They gave me a code that didn't work. So I don't understand. So it's possible to work like this. They don't pay that much attention to people. They might as well close it down. Fast and friendly service.\nTo-go juice and snack island\nFresh pastry.\nBeautiful interior design.\nWide variety of seating.\nFree wifi. Great school - The teachers are incredibly caring and supportive, always making sure that students feel comfortable and encouraged in their learning. They go above and beyond to provide personalized attention, making the classes both engaging and effective. A fantastic place to learn Polish in a welcoming environment! Great Polish school! The kids love attending (have been going for ~6 years). The teachers are awesome! Plenty of different events and activities supporting Polish tradition. Highly recommended! Whoever lives here just bumped into my car on purpose, because I parked \"in front of his house\" and he claims it is his parking spot. Although it is a public 2h parking. Stay away from such bad actors! very bad and boring Teachers shouldn't get frustrated with you if you don't understand a concept. Glad I left. If you want your child to stress about doing 5 subjects of homework every night, great school. Some of the teachers were nice though. Most weren't. Horrible School who takes credit for scholars when in actuality they just push all other children out. The administration staff taunted my child the entire time he attended this school. My son needed up with serve anxiety after attending this school which stopped the second he was placed in another school. He was also almost held back for no reason yet is a high honors student in his new school. This place should be shut down. The office staff is FAR from professional. They have a dean that has ZERO experience in education , it\u2019s messy and not a place for \u201ccertain\u201d children and they make that VERY clear through their actions. The teacher turn around is huge because of how they treat their teachers too. I wish I never sent my child here. Such a waste. bad school, ms Tata loves giving out demerits, and all of the literature in reading, writing and history will fill your child's head with the idea of \"racism\". BCCS 4 LIFE A interesting endeavor in a refurbished industrial building. Almost a decade old with various distinctive areas. Good varied brews with some limited food options. Does flights. Had games for playing and houses the remnants of the Bad Art Museum. Has parking on the weekends. They have food and an extensive drink menu. This would be fun for younger adults. They have bar games, basketball and loop and hook. The food was okay. They have merch. The staff is really nice especially the hostess. There is a parking lot. We had our wedding celebration at Dorchester Brewing in September and couldn't be happier with how it went.\n\nSpace: The upstairs hopservatory, which we booked for the event, was beautiful and works so well as an event space.  There was room for dining, dancing, guests could go outdoors, there is a private bathroom, and the space itself is really lovely.  The kids in attendance were excited about the game room downstairs and spent a ton of time between the upstairs, downstairs, and out on the roof deck.  The brewery provides access to the sound system and provides a mic, so we were all set for speeches and music.\n\nFood and Drink:  Our guests loved M&M BBQ, and I am still getting comments about how good the food was.  The catering coordinator for M&M, Candace, is excellent and was helpful, responsive, personable, and made sure everything went smoothly for us.\n\nBar and Service: We couldn't have been happier with our bartenders, Brandon and Joy, who were friendly and super attentive.  Joy was also the event coordinator and went above and beyond setting up 240(!!) mini cupcakes for us when our cupcakes were delivered at the wrong time.\n\nOverall: We were so thrilled with our event and would recommend Dorchester Brewing to anyone considering having their wedding there.  Our happened to be a more low-key casual wedding, but I think the space would accommodate a fancier event as well.  We would book again here in a heartbeat. Place is awesome! I went on a Tuesday, so it was pretty chill - I don\u2019t like really loud places.\nThe beers were good and very high quality.\nAnd the bratwurst? OMG. Unreal.\nLots of space, and I guess they do private events if you want to.\nCool rooftop area, games, plenty of seating (especially upstairs) and some neat merchandise as well. Some cool artwork on the walls, nice big clean bathrooms, and cool music.\nI bought a pint glass for my cross-country collection.\nThey\u2019re gay friendly apparently because of the owner, but it\u2019s not overly themed as such. I\u2019d say everyone is welcome!\nIf I\u2019m in the area again, I\u2019d very much like to revisit.\n\nRecommended! Loved this queer friendly brewery! They had a great cider and sours if you\u2019re not a huge beer drinker like me. They have food, the fries were great but we were a little disappointed by the rest of the food we got. They have board games to play, some arcade games and the Museum of Bad Art which we loved walking around and looking at. Would definitely come back here the next time I\u2019m in the area!"

    "reviews": "We didn\u2019t expect much when we stopped by this restaurant after leaving the JFK Museum, just a little hungry and looking for something nearby. But we were blown away by how good it was! The fried rice with scallops was incredible\u2014way better than expected. And the beef skewers were absolutely yummy. Edit first: 2 long black hairs and a eyelash w thick root found in my to go box and on site. I am not sure this place deserves A sanitary rate when you also have a dog in dining area - however cute he was.\n\nGood fiskie fried rice with cucumber pieces! Great but spicy double cooked pork rice (fat delicious pork pieces, i normally trim fat off bacon!). Smoothies w almond milk or coconut water. Good food, reasonable price but no table service and inside a private gated community with challenging parking on that block Fantastic food! Braised eggplant and spicy cucumber salad were especially amazing! Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for a chill place to grab good food around the JFK library and EMK institute. YUM\uff01\uff01\uff01They serve American food and Chinese food which both were really great.\nstopped by and the burger was fresh and juicy.\nCustomer service was great. We tried their hot panini and a sub. Really liked the panini but the sub could have been better. A good spot to grab a quick bite. The staff are hardworking but this place is strange and operates differently from other stores in the chain. They don\u2019t allow ordering and collecting points through the Dunkin app even though they advertise the App prices on the menu\u2026 Seems like a ploy to overcharge students. Shame. I ordered one coffee they charged me for two and the made both wrong. The lines are always long and most of the staff is nice there are few that are rude. They burn the bread when they toast it and ate constantly rushing everyone. The mobile orders aren\u2019t in a secure location and they don\u2019t have the same menu options as they do when you stand in line. They often don\u2019t make your order even when you order on Bites, until you get there. If you can go go to campus Starbucks not worth it. They also run out of hash browns and constantly replace them with tater tots forThe cafeteria In my experience, the staff are very friendly, and exceptionally quick. Even when the line is super long, you can still get your order in a timely manner. I'm honestly very impressed by their service.\n\nIn terms of accuracy, I've only had one incorrect order, but it was not a big deal so I didn't raise any issue (iced caffe latte instead of an iced matcha latte, but it was still good).\n\nAlso, this Dunkin' makes the matcha lattes better than most Dunkin' locations: most don't blend it enough, but either their machine works better than others or they use the right proportions of milk and matcha powder. Either way, it results in a smooth, creamy beverage that is much better than the overly sweet, gritty sediment I've experienced from other locations. They always get my order wrong. Sometimes I think it's because of how loud the campus center gets but even when I order when it's silent,they  still manage to get it wrong so I'm starting to think it's them. Repeating the order back and ensuring the correct order would be great Every single time I get a sandwich it\u2019s cold. I don\u2019t mean undercooked, I mean actually cold to the touch. I have to give it back and ask them to cook it every time. This location is prejudice against its black customers. This is the third time we ordered the exact same thing and did not receive the value drink that came with the Duo Jr $5 combo. This time we forced them for the receipt. They claimed to have supplemented the value coke that came with the duo jr meal but they charged us for the water that was to take its place. We didn\u2019t even ask for a substitute for the coke. We just never received it. When I went inside they pretended they couldn\u2019t speak English so when I spoke in Spanish they decided to communicate with me and English and that\u2019s when they printed the receipt. They did not give us the coke and both manager and supervisor was there and would not assist in correcting the error. There was also a black woman that was charged for beverages she did not receive and she too was not being assisted by the managers and supervisor that came out and said nothing when their employees got rude with us and the customer prior to us with the error they made. We believe they discriminate against people of color at this location. This Burger King sadly doesn\u2019t deserve no stars because I made an online order through the Burger King app and my food was never delivered. The app has absolutely no help or customer service aside from and AI messenger who literally does nothing!!! I went to the store at least try and get my food since it was $67 I spent they could\u2019ve at least give me the food. They didn\u2019t give me no food or my money back!! I\u2019ve never met a manager who didn\u2019t have the number to customer service or any sort of help. It\u2019s truly sad that they could\u2019ve help me. Burger King you always say at BK have it your way!! I sure didn\u2019t have it my way!! So to corporate you all need to do better either fix the app or literally don\u2019t hire drivers and only have pickup service because delivery clearly ain\u2019t working!! The employees are on top of things the restaurant is always very clean including the restrooms. Security is even helpful. Only thing I don't like is the people that are always asking for a dollar and a cigarette they need to get rid of that. Worst Burger King ever.  They NEVER get the order right.  Just ordered a whopper, 4 cheeseburgers, and mozzarella sticks.  They left out the whopper (and the marinara sauce).  How incompetent do you have to be to forget the main item? Food is ok but they seem to ALWAYS forget something in my order BURGERKING ON WASHINGTON STREET IN DORCHESTER\nAnd the lady on the intercom had a nasty attitude Brought my bike in for a tune up and to fix an issue. The owner was incredibly kind & knowledgeable and took the time to explain the issue. They were able to turn around the bike in 24 hours which was far sooner than I imagined. I have brought my bike here for various issues in the past and they always have returned the bike with everything fixed and the bike looking new. I would definitely recommend this shop to anyone & will return in the future! We were cycle touring in Turkey when we met the owner of this place, R\u00fcstem.\nHe approached us asking about our trip and offering some help with bike maintenance.\nAt the beginning we didn't want to bother him but we ended up asking a few things. We discovered one bike chain was about to get broken.\nHe kindly offered to repair it at his house with the proper tools. Once there, he repaired that and also the brakes, he even took the time to make the brakes wire shorter to make them more efficient and avoid having so much wire on the way. He also adjusted the shifting and took a general look of both bicycles to make sure we were okay to keep on with our trip.\nWe have really no words to demonstrate how grateful and thankful we are with R\u00fcstem, he showed us truly interested in helping us without looking for anything in exchange. Giving his time and knowledge without expecting anything in return is a holy gift for us.\nPeople like him are making every day a better world, so we can only hope for the very best for him, his family and his project with Quad Cycles.\nMati and Al This is a great shop. The owner is very considerate and welcoming, and has gone above and beyond to make my bike function well. On my last visit I came in to get my gear cable replaced and he also fixed up my bike lock to attach to my bike rack instead of hanging on the handlebar. Some sports shops can be a little snobbish if you aren't a \"serious\" enough practitioner, and I'm glad to say I've never felt that way here. The owner has been very considerate and capable. Was on the hunt for a specific size seatpost clamp for another one of my personal builds. Wheelworks didn't have it and I needed it done now. Called Quad up and I was told they had it in stock. When I showed up the part was ready on the counter but it had those fender eyelets when my touring frame already had frame eyelets so I mentioned it. I was told that was actually a feature (true.) but not to me. Rushtom, the owner went looking on the sales floor for a bike that had a comparable seatpost. Took several tries and no luck, so the guy disappeared in the back of the shop and reappeared with the clamp. Not only did it fit but it matches perfectly. I was told that's a rare seatpost clamp to start with. Woe is on me.\n\nThanks for the assistance,\n\nJap MEN ONLY. WOMEN NOT WELCOME.\n\nMy wife has now brought two separate bikes to Quad Cycles for tuneups and other standard work. Both times the final invoice has somehow been mysteriously marked up by over $100 from what was initially quoted. The only explanation offered by the shop owner has been a hand-wavey \"it was harder and took longer than expected.\"\n\nThis completely unacceptable business practice is compounded by the fact that it only seems to happen to customers who are female. My friend (male) who really knows his stuff when it comes to bikes has had good interactions with this shop.\n\nIn closing - if you can call the owner on his BS then this might be an ok place to go. Otherwise, go somewhere else where they don't take advantage of customers' lack of knowledge. Had my first rugby game on Saturday against the ironsides(great team btw) and the field was spacious and well maintained. I wish they had more porta potties next to the fields but otherwise a great time there Great place. I'm not sure if the place is usually this quiet or just the time I went there. Great small beach-ish place, not quite a full fledged one. But soothing any way. My first time here & I absolutely love it! It\u2019s clean the sand is soft and the beach rocks are gorgeous what more can u want This is a great playground with splash pad. Lots of space to run. Basketball court & other sport fields Clean, but in desperate need of some renovating. One available toilet made for an anxious walk. The grounds are nice enough, but I\u2019d love for the boardwalk to have new businesses in them"

    "reviews": "Spend more time in line at 6:30am than I do shopping. One line, no self checkout open, multiple people getting full carts when i need 3 things. Don\u2019t recommend coming here early. Very Ean, Pharmacy was very kind and helpful filling out paperwork to get new Covid shot and Flu vaccine in less than 10 minutes. If you want to get an excellent experience, you should go in the afternoon. The employees are much kinder and take the time to explain to you and if you have any questions they will explain to you very kindly. This pharmacy is the best. The pharmacists are caring and extremely knowledgable. They make you feel comfortable enough to ask questions. The best pharmacy experience you\u2019ll ever have !! This isn't recent but I was at wk at the school there & had some awesome clerks helping me with a smile. Was a pleasure doing my shopping there. Second time being here cause i don't remember how the food was the first time. it was OK. The pancakes are good, so were the tater tots but how could you mess those up?\nThe eggs were bland and the turkey sausage was just not good, to me at least. Would you like Hot Sauce with that?\n\nMcKennas is a Boston STAPLE, and has been for decades. I\u2019ve dined here at-least 30 times over the years and time after time they deliver. The pancakes, fluffy and large. Eggs - cooked to perfection. Service can be hit or miss but that\u2019s life. Yet my #1 go-to favorite choice every time I go is the \u201cMayor\u2019s Special\u201d. It\u2019s probably around 3 pounds of food for 18 dollars. In essence the meal is every breakfast item (except pancakes) stacked together in one giant heap of hearty excellence. Being a larger man this meal is the perfect choice for a working fella looking for the fulfilling meal he deserves.\n\nAnd no, I would not like Hot Sauce with my meal. McKennas is one of the top choices for breakfast in Boston. The menu has a wide variety of choices for lunch also. The scenery is cool filled with old school classic diner pics. Everything I\u2019ve tried was pretty good if not excellent. I like they have non dairy options for coffee and also vegetarian. Just get there early on weekends or be prepared for a light wait. The aesthetic and vibe of this place is everything. The service was top notch, super polite, friendly, accommodating. My steak omelet was extremely dry and flavorless, my toast was burnt and I didn't recieve the baked beans that it said it came with. Parking was very tough to find, especially with construction redirecting you. I tipped well for the excellent service, but I wouldn't come back here to eat. My favorite breakfast spot in Boston (Savin Hill)... they are popular place for good reason even though seating is limited.  Great food, reasonable price and servers mostly friendly and efficient. Can be busy but worth a wait for one of those coveted tables."

    "reviews": "I really enjoy brunch here! It's really really good! The service is good, considering I've only ever seen one server, and she takes a little longer, bit she manages to provide the best service she can and she's very nice! I've never had lunch or dinner here but if the food is as delicious and fresh as brunch, I'll definitely be back for it! I'm assuming the bar and drinks are pretty good, considering the 2 times I've been here, there's been a full bar for brunch times! Fun crowds and good bartenders. I fully intend to keep returning here! Highly recommend! I've been a regular at Harp & Bard for the past few months, and the food has always been exceptional. You can tell they prioritize quality everything tastes fresh, and they clearly don't cut corners. The fries are incredible, with a flavor that shows they use high-quality ingredients and oils for cooking. I really appreciate that, as I can't stand when restaurants reuse their oils Harp & Bard definitely doesn\u2019t give off that vibe.\n\nRecently, I decided to try their brunch menu, and I was blown away. Their chocolate chip pancakes are some of the best I\u2019ve ever had. I also ordered the breakfast burger (without bacon) with a side of home fries, and I was amazed at how delicious everything was.\n\nThe service was fantastic too. If you're looking for great food at a reasonable price, I highly recommend this spot. Was there on a Wednesday at 7pm. Bar seating was about half and place was a bit more than half full. I ordered wings and the veggie platter. The wings were massive and I could have done with 10 but at 3 bucks more I went 15, not knowing. They were not breaded and deep fried nicely, perfect for my taste. Veggie platter was huge,super fresh and included broccoli and red peppers which are very healthy. Hostess and Server were perfect. By 8pm bar seating was filling up and so was the place. Highly recommend.\n\nSold me with the veg platter when I checked the menu online. I am just visiting and find it hard to get the health food in while traveling! Simply awesome ! The food is HUGE, you will need a box, the service is top notch,  we wish we discovered this place earlier in the vacation because we would have gone back.  The decor inside is very nice, tables and booths or bar seating if you want to watch games on TV. Very quick service, this is a must go place. We had the large seafood platter, steak tips with sweet potato fries, mac n cheese, mozzarella as an appetizer,  and the ziti with chicken and broccoli. Amazing! Great for families Came here on a Friday for a late lunch. Service was great, everyone was her friendly. I got the broccoli chicken Alfredo pizza and it was great and my boyfriend got the friend shrimp plate and he liked it. I do think it was a bit pricey tho at $26 for 6 pieces of shrimp. We played KENO and brought our baby with us and they were accommodating! Would definitely go back to try other dishes Really this school is fabulous, truly inclusive, and with very dedicated teachers and staff."

    "reviews": "I worked with owner Stephanie on florals for my sister's wedding- if you're looking for an every-occasion florist, trust me when I say you could not be in better hands. From consultation to delivery, Stephanie and her team provide five star service with love and expert-level attention to detail. The bride and groom, both professional chefs, favored bold colors and tropical greenery. With limited direction, Stephanie transformed their vision into a showstopping tropical paradise that pulled gasps from both guests and passers-by of their Boston Common nuptuals and Southie reception. The arrangements she created not only showcased the couple's passions as chefs (with herbs, peppers and tomatoes artistically weaved in!!) but also gave a nod to their Mexican and Puerto Rican heritages, something not lost on family members who'd traveled thousands of miles to attend. The massive pieces she created for the ceremony were repurposed for the venue and I'm still not really sure how she managed to weave through 9/1 aka Moving Day traffic to do it all before the guests arrived but she did and it was perfect. We wanted a fun photodrop for guests to take pictures in front of, and Stephanie really knocked it out of the park with a showstopper arch teeming with texture and verdant greenery. I still kick myself for beelining to the open bar instead of taking the time to capture more photos. We could not have been happier with the results, and are so grateful to have worked with Stephanie on my sister's special day. Thank you all!! I cannot recommend Coleen's Flowers highly enough!  They came recommended by our venue, and having used them, I can see why.  Not only was our contact (Brittany) a joy to work with -- responsive when I had questions, patient when I flipflopped on details, and very conscientious about keeping to the budget I set in our first meeting -- but the flowers themselves were absolutely stunning.  Everything looked lush and overflowing, as I hoped, and so many of our guests complimented how beautiful the arrangements were.  If you are thinking of hiring them, do it now! You won't regret it! 5 stars! I was looking for exactly what your designers bouquet looked like! It was elegant and perfect for the occasion. The receiver of the flowers was SO happy and even commented how beautiful they were. Great job and no issues with the ordering process. I would highly recommend to anyone that needs flowers in the area! I can't express how thrilled we were with the exceptional service provided by Coleen and her team for our wedding!  From the moment we met with her, her expertise and passion for creating stunning floral arrangements was evident.\n\nThe attention to detail was impeccable \u2013 every bouquet and centerpiece was a work of art, carefully crafted to match our wedding theme perfectly. The colors, textures, and variety of flowers used truly brought our vision to life, and we received countless compliments from our guests on how breathtaking everything looked.\n\nThroughout the planning process, Coleen was incredibly responsive and patient. It only took one meeting with Coleen to understand what we were looking for and she knocked it out of the park.  Her professionalism and genuine enthusiasm made us feel like our wedding was her top priority.\n\nOn the big day, the floral arrangements were delivered and set up with the utmost care. The entire venue was transformed into a magical wonderland that exceeded our wildest dreams. The flowers not only looked stunning in person but also photographed beautifully, adding an extra layer of elegance to our wedding album.\n\nWorking with Coleen was an absolute pleasure, and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. If you're looking for a wedding florist who will go above and beyond to create a truly memorable and enchanting atmosphere, look no further. We wholeheartedly recommend Coleen to any couple seeking top-tier floral artistry for their special day. Thank you for making our wedding a truly unforgettable masterpiece! Coleen and Michaela make the process easy from start to finish. They were extremely diligent about making our vision come to life within the budget parameters that we had set. We used Coleen's Flower Shop for our bouquets, boutonnieres, and the candles/floral centerpieces at our reception. Each one was stunning and led to many compliments from our guests. Thank you to your team for making recommendations about what was in season and being so skilled with your craft. The Food At Alves Definitely Taste like Home Cooked Cape Verdean. It's Really Delicious!\n\nThere are Plenty of Choices to Pick From! Everyone Here is,\n\n~ Friendly & Respectful Great food and cheap as well. I have been going there for years and the food and service has always been great. I do say the grilled chicken is good but not as great as it was before. I do not know if there was a change in way of cooking it but it is still very taste.\n\nOverall, I recommend people stop by if they need food or Cape Verdean product. So many authentic Portuguese dishes! Brings back my childhood ... delicious real food. Alves is what you would expect from a Cape Verdean neighborhood market. It is packed with a little of everything from beverages to baked treats and prepared foods, canned goods and big bags of groceries. The menu is typical with tasty fried pork, chicken, rice with beans, stewed meats with eggs and more. If you get there early you will get to pick from your favorites. I usually try a little of everything and I love the rice. It's always fresh. There is ample variety and the price is very reasonable. Alves is closed on Tuesdays. Parking is available on the street if the lot is full. Also, depending on the day and time there may be a line so don't plan on rushing in and out. And definitely get there in the first half of the day if you can. Great place to grab lunch or a snack, also grew up on it"

    "reviews": "The lotus root salad was fresh and nicely presented. It had a pleasant sweet and sour flavor, and there was some meat included, but the portion was quite small for the price of $14.50. I was expecting either more meat or a more generous serving. Service was okay, and the restaurant was clean and comfortable. Overall, it was an average experience. It\u2019s not bad, but not memorable either. I love this place! My family and I have been coming here for a few years now. The food never disappoints. The servers and owner are also professional and very friendly. If you are looking for authentic Vietnamese food, definitely come check it out! This was one of the best vegetarian pho I have ever had. Most places, it feels like an after thought, but the vegetable broth was rich in flavor. They also had an organized vegetarian menu.\n\nMy partner got the chicken pho and enjoyed it as well! My first Pho experience and the Internet did not steer me wrong \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc A large bowl of round eye and flank Pho came with a plate of fresh basil, bean sprouts, lime quarters, and Thai bird eye chilli's on the side. Chilli sauce was on the table. Total make your own adventure for heat and flavor, but the soup broth MUST be sampled before you do anything to the bowl. A true labor of love and perfectly balanced comfort on its own. My boyfriend, who has had Pho before, said it was right on par with his other experiences. Pork spring rolls with peanut sauce were light and crunchy. I now question the overly sweet peanut sauce I make at home as theirs was so subtle, but still packed a good flavor. I am now afraid to try any other place as this was such a great first experience. As I am about an hour away, it was definitely worth the drive and we will be back. i had both the pho dac biet and bun bo hue delivered and both were very good!! as someone who has been searching for legit viet food since i've moved here, this is now my favorite place and reminds me a lot of home. great portions for delivery as well. Their bun noodle soup is great! It\u2019s like a treasure hunt when I found all sorts of goodness inside the soup: pork feet, tenderloin, thin slices of beef, and more! Will come back to order again! I\u2019m a Viet girl from San Jose. I would take my Viet grandparents here if they ever visited me in Boston. Do I need to say more?\n\nPho came out fast, hot, and delicious. Not the best broth I\u2019ve had but it does the job quite well. The place was spacious and full of Viet families out for lunch (which is such a green flag). The servers were quick and courteous, and they spoke English well for those who care about that. I crave Viet food that tastes like home, and this hit the spot for me. This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite go-to\u2019s. We ordered tofu spring rolls, pho chay, and pho tai nam. The flank was fatty and flavorful, but the broth, while decent, wasn\u2019t outstanding. The noodle portions were quite small. The best beginner spot in Dorchester for Pho enthusiasts or first timers. Lovely staff, beautiful atmosphere, and quick service. My pho came out in about 2 minutes on a Saturday evening. Very much foreigner friendly. I ordered the 38 - beef flank and stripe Pho. 9/10 just needs more veggies. I will never come back again, the owner of this restaurant is cunning and greedy.\nThe food is average, but the service is bad. I walked out of this place with a bad taste in my mouth.\nMy wife ordered a \u201cCombination Rice\u201d, I ordered a Pho Xe L\u1eeda. The waitress was a young Vietnamese woman who could barely speak any English. With a very heavy ascent, she asked me a question which I didn\u2019t understand and had to ask her to repeat,  slowly she said \u201cdo you want to add a big bowl ? (to share the noodles with my wife ). \u201cOh!\u201d I politely replied \u201cyes please\u201d. At the end of the meal when the bill came, there was an extra charge of $3.98 for \u201cbeef meatball\u201d. I questioned why the extra charge for one tiny piece of beef ball the size of a grape,  the waitress said \u201cyou ordered it\u201d. She said I asked you \u201cdo you want to add a beef ball ?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s already in the computer, you have to pay!\u201d.she said. Sneaky practice! This  place is about 4 blocks from my apartment, I wish it were 3 blocks so that I were that much closer to their meatball sandwich. Oh also the wings are great. Got the buffalo wings, BEST wings in the dorchester area so far! The wings are massive and fairly priced. Staff was super kind and helpful. I forgot to ask for a side blue cheese/ranch and when I got home they had put it in there anyway. 10/10 would recommend. The chicken and/or shrimp Ziti with broccoli Alfredo is the best, and I have ordered it from other places but it never came close to D'Bennys, I love \u2764\ufe0f it.\nTheir steak and cheese subs are delicious and I love it with extra cheese especially.\nThe best place to order from in Dorchester. This has to be the worst  pizza I had specially for $12, I knew I was in trouble when there was no line but I still gave it a shot and it was awful Always loved D' Benny's for the buffalo chicken calzone. Up until recently theyare offering a lot more menu items and quality. May not be a place to host a date, but definitely what we need on a plate. And found time to assist me in my decision. Wish the Blue cheese was better though."

Every time I get pizza from this store I always wonder how y\u2019all are still doing business. This is not okay, this looks fake and the pizza is never fully cooked even if I check well done off \ud83d\ude2d. Please if you're going to stay open do some updated training courses on how to cook a pizza pleaseeeeeeee I called 2 times to inquire about why the delivery driver was driving in the complete opposite direction and got no answer just dead air each time. The ETA kept increasing and by the time the food got here it was ice cold like the movie Frozen. We were better off with Digiorno. I\u2019ve ordered at other Dominoes this has to be the absolute worst. The hood needs to do better, this is ridiculous Ordered 3 sauces with my order. After the order came, there were no sauces to be seen. After asking for them, they stated there was none left, but still decided to buy it on the tab. Are they dumb? How do you say you don\u2019t have something and still buy it on the tab. Probably exploiting the customer because their English is not good. Horrible spot, don\u2019t come. Paid $17.98 plus tax for two honey bbq chicken wings only to get 2 Buffalo which I do not eat ! Not to mention an hour and 45 mins wait for delivery, delivery guy was okay , gave him a tip, had 8 boxes in total, was only fair to tip the driver. Did not notice until after I had eaten my pasta and proceeded to my chicken and both was a disappointment. Also food was cold . Paid $74 in total ,this shouldn't have happened. I do not recommend this place . Been on hold for more than 30 minutes! And still no answer . A waste of money and time. I ordered delivery and these dummies really didn\u2019t call me to let me know they were outside. (idk if driver was male or female) They left my food on the steps outside in super cold temperatures. 19 degrees. I waited over an hour for that call and when I called the store they never answered. So now I\u2019m out on food and no refund. Horrible. We were in the Dorchester area and stopped in for lunch at Thai Oishi. We were Greeted by a Friendly Hostess who seated us immediately. Our Waitress was helpful with the menu questions and choices . The Ice Cold \u2744\ufe0f Sapporo Beers \ud83c\udf7b and Appetizers were Delicious \ud83d\ude0b . Appetizers and Entrees: Gyoza \ud83d\ude0b(deep fried pork dumplings), \ud83d\ude0bScallion Pancake, Unagi,  \ud83d\ude0b Dragon Roll, \ud83d\ude0bBeef Pad Thai, Num Tok Moo, \ud83d\ude0band Pork Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen \ud83d\ude0b everything was Tasty and Yummy \ud83d\ude0b. The Service was Excellent \ud83d\udc4d.\nHighly Recommend Thai Oishi!\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Excellent food and service! The highlight for me was tomyum soup. It was so flavorful and delicious. Papaya salad was great but it burned my tongue from every bite. I\u2019m not sure if they could adjust the heat since i never asked for that. Volcano hotate tasted great and nice presentation, there were some seafood mix in as well. The food was generous on portion size and not too expensive either. I used Thai Oishi for a lunch event at work. I ordered ahead. The staff were super helpful. There is a huge variety of items on the menu, so it made it easy to order something for all the dietary needs in our group. The food is also fantastic. I appreciate their use of fresh ingredients. My order was all ready at the set pickup time. All around a great experience. I will be using Thai Oishi again! I visited Boston and everything was so delicious I\u2019m writing this a year later because I\u2019m sitting here craving it states away. \ud83d\ude29 Highly recommend! I recommend everything we had! Thai Chili Chicken was one of my favorite meals ever (I\u2019m a critic & love asian), Teriyaki Salmon Bento Box, Salmon Avocado Roll. They also turned me onto gyoza. It was fried so perfectly. One of the best, most memorable & affordable meals. Please support this place so I can come back & enjoy this deliciousness again.\n\nSide note: parking SUCKS. But keep circling the block till something opens up or walk a couple blocks. Worth it! Went here today around afternoon time. :) Amazing food and amazing service. Everyone is a total sweetheart!\n\nThe food is perfect proportion. The sushi is definitely worth it! Thick slices! I got drunken noodles and definitely flavorful and worth it. It had perfect proportions of everything (meat, noodles, and veggies). The dumplings were soft and flavorful and the sauce helped add more flavor to it. The papaya salad had a variety and very good. Good proportion of miso soup for a good price. I loved the Thai tea also.\n\nThe servers were attentive and nice. The cooks/chefs/etc were timely.\n\nDefinitely give this restaurant a chance if you never gone here before. I might have lived close but today was my first time. This will be one of my new go-tos. Check the pics of the dishes out! This school was not very good. Honestly, the best part was my language arts teacher. I wish I could remember her name! Kids used to hate her and get so annoyed that she'd make us write words over and over and give us all these tests, but those tests prepared us for standardized testing. I did very well because of her teaching methods."

    "reviews": "Nice local cafe with variety of options. Vietnamese iced coffee was good and the Taj Mahal sandwich was a very interesting mix of curry and egg. A bit pricey for what it is but I\u2019d come back again. This spot has some solid, delicious, unique, and well-curated sandwiches. The taj mahal sandwich has some of the best egg salad fillings I've ever tasted and the turkey town pressed panini was perfectly toasted \u2014yet soft, and very flavorful.\n\nI'm not much of a coffee person but my partner is a coffee snob and thought that their brown sugar latte was delicious, which is not to be taken lightly from her. We'll definitely come back when we're in the area to try more slapping sandwiches (and coffee for her). Has a great atmosphere but the food is kinda lacking in quality and quantity. I got a sandwich and it was basically smashed chickpeas and avocado on bread.  And it was like $11 with no sides. Cute bakery on the corner of Dorchester Ave. There is plenty of seating inside, including a long dining table in the center for you to chat with strangers if you want to.\n\nThe person working at the front was very sweet and walked me through the different pastries. I went at opening, so everything was still available. I settled on the pecan cranberry scone. To be honest, I did not enjoy it that much because it was too dry, but the cranberry bits were nice, and it did taste a bit better once I heated it up. The portion size was also decent.\n\nI want to give this bakery another chance and try a different pastry. I had an \u201cOld Man & The Sea\u201d sandwich: tuna salad, avocado, arugula, cilantro, and sriracha mayo.  It was quite tasty, and the pickles\u2026dear salt-loving, zebra friends, the pickles here are FANTASTIC!!!\n\nI had mine on a sesame bagel this time, and I wouldn\u2019t do that again. The texture was off (toasting it would help, but the bagel was crumblier and gummier than the NY style bagels I like).\n\nThe strawberry almond bars and chocolate chip cookies are okay.  I like the distinct taste of butter (as a lot of pastries use more processed oil-based items), and the cookie didn\u2019t taste like butter to me, so I wouldn\u2019t get again.\n\nThey use MEM tea, which is my favorite, and I enjoyed the Japanese Sencha (SO tasty). They also have a La Marzoco for all you coffee lovers, and every kind of sweetener: from raw honey and stevia to Splenda to cane sugar.\n\nThe cafe isn\u2019t cheap, but it does have a sprawling space for the area, with comfy padded chairs or bar stools or hard chairs, board games, and a reading nook with art for sale.\n\nFully accessible cafe and restrooms. They have a lot of sweet and drink options! Had regular cappuccino, milk tea boba, matcha cheese foam they were yummy! Staff always friendly and kind The interior is cozy, and it was pretty lively on a holiday afternoon.\n\n- Matcha Cream Puff ($5): The shell had a nice crunch (I would have liked a harder crunch, but that just comes down to preference), and there was plenty of matcha cream, but the level of sweetness made it not overwhelming.\n- Corn Milk with Pandan (S\u1eefa B\u1eafp L\u00e1 D\u1ee9a) ($7.75): This is the only place I\u2019ve found around here that sells this. It was tasty. A little thick but smooth and sweet but refreshing. They offer an ice bag if you aren\u2019t able to refrigerate or drink it within thirty minutes.\n\nService was friendly. My only complaint is that the prices are high, but I was satisfied with the taste. Went to a Vietnamese Cafe to cool off.  I was curious at so many foods and drinks I have never tried, and Artichoke Tea (supposedly helps with everything from liver detox to adjusting to no fall bladder to weight loss to you name it).\n\nI was also curious about the Rau ma, but thankfully they insisted I try a sample first.  I\u2019m glad because it wasn\u2019t a taste I liked.\n\nThe Artichoke tea (THANH NHI\u1ec6T) was delicious, and she put basil seeds and some jelly inside.  It was honestly a bit too sweet.  I now know to just get it plain.  It\u2019s great as is!\n\nLastly, I tried B\u00e1nh B\u00f2 N\u01b0\u1edbng (Vietnamese Honeycomb Cake).  It\u2019s usc a unique taste AND texture.  Recipes I can find online are made with a tapioca starch, a ton of eggs, coconut milk, a little butter and sugar, baking powder, and pandan.\n\nI will have to come back!  This also has the best Halo Halo (Philippino dessert) I\u2019ve seen (didn\u2019t try it but it is the prettiest). Having been to many places, but the new milk tea is amazing. As a milk-tea fan, you shouldn't miss it. Great friendly and fast service. Good tasting drinks and che. Plenty of indoor seating for work, study or chit chatting. You also have small private corner for reading books, or meeting as well.\nLove this place and would definitely come back. Had their brown sugar Boba tea and it was delicious!  Personal preference is next time I will get half sweetness. Tried the Saigon Che and it was sweet and delicious! The Hot Luu was my favorite part. The staff is very friendly and the location is nice and bright and clean. I want to try their pastries still, but their crepes are great! Hello All ,\n\nplease do not send your child to this school ! I sent my son to this school for a year and it was the worst experience of his life. My son should have been removed when they let off the Dean of Students, Vice Principal, and then the ED, which was the first red flag. Then the teachers began to leave! My son did not have a certified math teacher until midway through the school year, and the science teacher was only present one day a week. It seems that all the good teachers have quit or have been laid off. Despite asking for months where is the special education lead, my son did not receive his services until the end of the school year. My niece attended this school when it was SLA, but it is NOT THE SAME!\n\nOh and dont get me started on the Admin , They do not commucatie changes or inform parents on issues I had to hear from my son about all these things , the school likes to put on a front which is crazy\n\nDO NOT SEND YOUR CHILD HERE! 0/10 This is a poor excuse of a school.Years ago they had better leadership,teachers and quality within the school but now ...not so much.\nThe head staff are clueless and they care more about keeping up a Front and appearance than actually providing students with what they need.Teachers burnt out and overworked and do not adequately provide support .School lacks major resources no support staff .No support for scholars who need more and absolutely no follow through with any thing from staff. They need an overhaul of head staff as they are all highly incompetent. Don't waste your time sending your child here you will regret it. They boast about a strong school/family community  but it is fake and nonexistent. terrable food, broke school, good teachers and staff most of the time, weird cafeteria/gym/auditorium room, from my expirence a lot of disorganized kids.  At times i enjoy this school but at others i dont,.\nIt doesnt bother me that the school still has the old school the building belonged to, name on it still under the new one but its misleading and odd because the old name is a catholic school and the new one is dla but both names are in bold on the side of the school. the education is good but its hard to get it with your classmates that fool around too much. I love this school for my son the community and teachers are very intuitive to the students and parents. My son actually loves going to school. I recommend this school highly. Our school is a amazing school that causes us to be self aware of our world and how we are treated they talk our history and take care of us and make us feel good about ourselves they are amazing staff and students DLA is an experience I will never forget I wish I wasn't leaving this year and wish they had a high school"

    "reviews": "Can't remember the barber's name (had a ponytail) but he's great. Cut a really nice fade and spent a lot of time & attention on lining up the sides with a straight razor. Def coming back - quality cut for a great price. Cash only (atm in the bodega next door). I thought I was getting a good experience, but I haven\u2019t been in here a while because at first I thought i was buggin. Recently came back for a lineup and my eyebrows, and i was vigoriously cut by Rafa. This is insane. I will not be coming back. Double check for that license. Barbers available on the spot, great pricing and great vibe. They cut my husband and treated him like family, did a great job also. It\u2019s the best barbershop in town by a mile!! I\u2019ve been coming here for about a year now and have never left disappointed. There is a new barber in this shop. His name is Juan and he has to be one of the top barbers in the city. Great with both adults and children. Talented, detailed and always professional. Star Fish \ud83d\udc1f has been around for a long time but this is the first time I\u2019ve had them. I had a small fish sandwich \ud83e\udd6a though the condiments are light like only ketchup, Mayo, Tartar sauce or Hot sauce so no lettuce, tomato etc. which I think would have made my sandwich even better. But it still was very good overall\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe. Let me first start off by saying this use to be a staple of the community . \u201cUse to be\u201c  \ud83d\ude12. Within the last year my last few visits  came with red flags and  have left me under the impression that this fish place has change hands in ownership without notifying the community and today I think I  got my confirmation . Whether there are new owners or not I definitely will not be patronizing or referring anyone to this restaurant or should I say \u201ctake out\u201d spot because they want you to place your order and step outside until the food is ready so it\u2019s definitely not welcoming \ud83d\ude12.\n\nThe problem is you can\u2019t serve a community for years with excellent, attentive service and then start serving trash and expecting people not to notice the difference. Especially when people are patronizing your business with their hard earned money in an overpriced ,struggling economy. You can\u2019t sit down and eat in this place anymore, the prices have gone up , the portions have gotten smaller and listening is not a skill that workers possess . The man that use to run this establishment use to be attentive when taking your order and the food was always fresh . This place use to be popular for its fish sandwiches and now they are just popular for pretending because ain\u2019t no way this is the same star fish that served the community for all these years .\n\nMy order was clearly stated and they still served me whatever they wanted to serve me .  I asked for a large haddock sandwich with \u201cno cheese\u201d and to my surprise when I got home I had a half haddock, half whiting and yes my sandwich did have cheese on it . Refer to the picture because Stevie wonder can tell that I was served two different kind of fish on my sandwich. Not to mention this sandwich use to be served with brown bread (if you know you know) I\u2019m disgusted that people think they can serve you whatever they want because new owners or not my last few experiences have been unacceptable. I don\u2019t expect a restaurant that has gained the trust of the community to give this kind of poor service and today they definitely played in my face and if they changed owners they are playing in all of the communities faces . The very community that kept their doors open all these years . (Purchased 1/23/24) Definitely not worth the $28.00. I was VERY disappointed in this restaurant. I had an eaten there for years, but was craving a fish sandwich. I went in and decided to get a Fishermans platter instead and I did not even get one whole piece of fish, literally cut and torn like I  like I was getting somebody\u2019s leftovers. This wasn\u2019t worth $10.00, most definitely left everything to be desired. No taste just a plate of cafeteria shoe string fries and the scraps of fish. I mean even the shrimp was chopped smh. This is highway robbery, never again. Haddock plate super reasonable price. Tartar sauce like no other has notes of garlic in it. I just bathed this haddock in it. This place has been doing it for a long long time swing by give it a shot . You will love it Just left and ordered an scallop plate and asked for a separate order of just clams w/ bellies\nReceived 6 scallops and 5 clams w/ fries for $36 in a non sweat proof container.\n\nTell me what 11 small peices of seafood like this should cost ?\nI used to vit for this place BUT after today\nNot going back so..buyer's beware\nONE This old, bedraggled brick building tries hard, but between the huge commercial billboard in the parking lot and small worn event spaces, it's obvious that both the city and the YMCA care more about function and aesthetic where the people have more $$ style votes. Best school ever!!! Deff apply! only if youre 17+"

    "reviews": "I had an incredible dining experience. The food was absolutely amazing, with flavors that truly stood out. Every dish we tried was perfectly prepared and exceeded our expectations. Our server was fantastic\u2014attentive, friendly, and made us feel so welcome. The overall atmosphere added to the experience, making it a night to remember. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and excellent service! Another great experience at one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. I came when it first opened and had made multiple visits throughout the years whenever I came to Boston. I have to say it kept raising the bar on the food, the taste, diversity, and creativity. It\u2019s one of those restaurants where you can order blindly off of the menu and won\u2019t be disappointed on anything. Thanks for another great dinner and will keep coming back. I recently traveled in from New Jersey to celebrate my birthday and had the pleasure of dining at this amazing restaurant. From start to finish, everything was exceptional! The food was absolutely delicious \u2013 each dish was expertly prepared, flavorful, and perfectly presented. The service was top-notch, and I want to give a special shoutout to our server, Matthew. He was attentive, friendly, and truly made our experience memorable. It's rare to find such a combination of great food and outstanding service. Highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience! Thank you for an unforgettable meal! We ate at Chickadee in January of 2025, and it was amazing!! We ordered the smoked sea trout dip, lobster campanelle, squash tart, Atlantic halibut, and Rohan duck three ways. The portions were VERY generous and the food was delicious!! We especially loved the sea trout dip, squash tart, and Rohan duck (especially the crispy rice!) The service was amazing, and we loved our experience here! I definitely recommend booking a reservation on their website! Quite possibly one of our favorite restaurants in Boston.  You can\u2019t go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nThe chef makes magic happen with mixing flavors and ingredients that you may not expect, but leave you wanting more.\n\nWe started with their mezzo dips, served with warm homemade pitas.  Each were so unique and flavorful, my favorite was the beet tzatziki, topped with fresh dill, so good!\n\nWe then had my favorite fried chicken ever, their Crispy Fried Chicken. It was seasoned exceptionally, and had a flavorful contrasting, delightful cream sauce, I wanted more, but we still had our entrees coming.\n\nBetween the 3 of us, we ordered the Farro Risotto, Black Truffle Mafaldine & the Handmade Ricotta Gnudi.  We each sampled each other\u2019s plates and couldn\u2019t decide which was the best dish (they were all delish).\n\nWe have yet to save room for dessert, but maybe next visit.\n\nA short ride from Logan Airport, it\u2019s the perfect place to dine before or after a flight. No need to pay for parking, or to try and find a parking spot is a bonus! We will be back! We chose Farmacy Cafe and Catering for our wedding day. It was one of the best decisions! Brian and the Farmacy catering team were great to work with. Brian helped us put together a great menu - featuring a taco bar for the dinner at our reception. It was phenomenal! When we did our food tasting in advance, we were planning to do cupcakes for dessert, but the cookies Brian had made that day were too good to pass up. Cookies were a great dessert on our wedding day.\nBrian was helpful throughout the whole process - answering questions and helping to make tweaks to our final menu. The staff at the wedding was so friendly and made sure we were taken care of all night.\nIt was an overall great experience - great staff and we LOVED the food - from duck bacon BLTs to tacos and cookies, and our funfetti wedding cake. 10/10 would recommend!! I was excited to try this vegan wrap, but unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. The wrap lacked fresh mushrooms, instead featuring jarred ones, and was overpowered by an abundance of red onions fried in what tasted like old, burnt grease. To make matters worse, the moment I opened the bag, I was hit with a strong meaty smell. If you're looking for a fresh, light, and authentic vegan wrap, I'd suggest exploring other options.\nHere's a rewritten version of your review that highlights the positive aspects of your experience:\nAlthough my food experience was disappointing, I must commend the restaurant on their excellent customer service. The staff was very friendly and attentive, making sure I felt welcome. Additionally, the interior of the restaurant was spotless, showing a clear commitment to cleanliness. These aspects showed promise, but unfortunately, the food didn't quite match up. My wife and I highly recommend working with Farmacy Cafe and Catering. Farmacy catered our wedding in November 2023. We had cocktail hour, family style dinner, dessert and a late night snack - everything was delicious. Brian is the best! His food is amazing and beautifully presented. The fun and creative way he plates and serves his food makes his passion to produce an outstanding product very clear. We emailed with him several times to adjust the food and bar menu. He was very flexible and professional each time. On top of being a great chef, he\u2019s also just a really nice person! The service staff was awesome. We had several guests compliment the service and say how friendly everyone was. Couldn\u2019t be happier with our experience. The photos included with this review are by Kylee B Photography. Such a cute little sit down spot. We went on a Monday morning and it wasn\u2019t too busy. Food came out quickly and was suuuuper good! Prices are affordable and honestly quite a deal. Definitely will be coming back and bringing friends :) I\u2019m so glad I found this place a few days ago the food is delicious. I was originally just going to get a standard breakfast meal until I saw they had a Fried green tomato BLT it was too good. I was hoping to order something today since they\u2019ve been on my mind for a few days but sadly they are closed but I will gladly spend my money here again and it\u2019s a new favorite spot. I love everything Fare Well has on their menu. My new favorites are their Dry Dock bowl and Bacon Scalzone, and its a bonus the services is always fast and friendly. Couldn't recommend them enough. Fare Well is just amazing!! John the owner is just truly a remarkable person both personally and professionally. My company has ordered from them several times on our catering lunch orders and John always will work within our needs to ensure we're satisfied to full potential. I am also a huge fan of their Drydock grain bowl - it's delish! :) Super small salad and expensive, this is extra greens.  Sweetgreens is 5x better and better value Cannot beat the scalzones and service here!  Great group of guys and the food is always delicious.  Please don't leave the IDB!

    "reviews": "Karen restaurant of nightmares. They got angry and rude after we said we\u2019re ordering food! We only got coffee. All the food looked bland and dry and frozen. Ripoff prices. Monopoly airport I would never eat here, better off to fast. I went to the bar to grab a bite to eat and Jennifer took my order - the burger and a Pepsi. I inquired if I could have it to go and she informed me that I needed to go to the takeout area. I apologize and went to the takeout counter. After placing my order, I went to the bathroom. Upon my return, I was met with \u201cdidn\u2019t you place an order at the bar?\u201d I shared with them what happened and then the gentleman what seemed to be the manager, walked to the bar where Jennifer was and they began discussing me and what happened. I walked over to them and the manager waved me off. If it wasn\u2019t for the customer service from the cook and the young lady that took my order, I would\u2019ve asked for my money back. Logan Airport should place another restaurant in the terminal. I will not eat there nor order from there again.\n\nMayor Angela Caraway\nTown of Ansonville, NC I'm glad I didn't look at reviews before sitting down, because I probably would have gone somewhere else. I don't know what happened, but I apparently had a really different experience from everyone else! The pizza (fennel sausage) was delicious, and the service was good. I let the server know I was boarding in 25 minutes, she said the pizza would take 15-20 and I said I'd risk it. It came out exactly when she said it would.\n\nThe crust was good, but nothing to write home about (although it tasted like it had a little sourdough in it, which was a good touch.) It was a little \"bready\" in a way that's typical at places that don't specialize in pizza, but honestly way better than my expectations for an airport. The sauce/cheese/toppings, though, were fantastic.\n\nTo the person who called theirs burnt, and posted a picture -- we might have to agree to disagree on what a good Neapolitan pizza should look like, but mine also came out a bit lighter than yours.\n\nIf you're used to high-touch restaurant service, you might find the staff a bit rushed, but frankly I'm an introvert and the only thing I care about in airport food service is efficiency, and I give them an A+.\n\n(I guess a bunch of the other reviews found them to be understaffed and having issues during breakfast. I had dinner, and not at a peak mealtime, so I can't speak to that.)\n\nOh, and to the people saying it's overpriced... yeah, you're probably right. I'm from the SF Bay Area, so I guess I'm used to it. The most uninspired burger I\u2019ve ever had. I love burgers and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever not finished one and I left a couple bites of it. Looks pretty solid but just flavorless.\nPickle was solid. Generous portion of fries but just standard frozen fries.\nAll for 20.87$ (before tip) place is a rip off. The worst breakfast ever and super expensive. The food was with too much pepper, avocado toast was with bad avocado. It was terrible. The service was ok. No decaf coffee!! Dunkin\u2019 Donuts is much better than this place !!! Don\u2019t waste your money here!!! The food was 5 stars, but our server seemed to lack experience, and personality!\nWe started with oysters. They were delicious! (Server brought a couple first instead of a couple dozen...and had an irritated response to it). Our entrees were all fantastic and perfectly cooked. I had the swordfish kebabs, with sauteed spinach and brusselspours. So amazingly good!  Unfortunately our server lacked interaction and pleasantry. She seemed quite overwhelmed. The legal test kitchen is a restaurant and sports bar in one place. The tv screens are not that big, so it\u2019s not really annoying. The service was good and the staff friendly. The food was like okay, not the best I ever had. Therefore the prices are a lil bit high but okay for dining in Boston. It\u2019s a good restaurant but I think I would not come again. Spot is premium, friendly and knowledgeable staff, me and a co worker ordered the LTK Tower (all was good except the clams) and the lobstaaa Mac n cheese.\nI have to mention the have a special lobster meat marinade in special mix (fantastic with crisp clean finish) I thought one of the ingredients was Saki. Food was awesome. I got the Halibut Steak special and the Strawberry Shortcake as a desert and they were served properly and on time. Once again, you have to try their red sangria at least once. Legal Test Kitchen is a local chain arround the Boston area that's famous for its seafood. We had to have to clam chowder and the lobster roll (seasonal price).  Chowder was nice and thick with a good amount of fresh clams and not too salty.  Good amount of oyster crackers too if that's your thing.\nLobster roll came with lightly toasted and buttered bread and the lobster itself was meaty and fresh.  Definitely not overcooked and not rubbery at all.  Seasoned nicely and came with really good crunchy fries.  The only thing with this location is that service can be a little slow sometimes and it would be best to make reservations. Its one of the healthiest airport stops you\u2019re going to find in the US. Sprouted almonds (get the pizza almonds!!), organic dark chocolate, hard boiled eggs, chicken breasts to-go, etc. Lots of good options here plus coffee Pleasantly surprised by the delicious breakfast sandwich made fresh for me this morning. Staff was efficient,  helpful, and friendly. This was a great start to my vacation- delicious and hot airport food- who knew??\nThanks!  And the coffee tasted great too!\nDenise from Newport\u2026. Imagine asking for a tip for a plain bagel where you make your customer spread their own cream cheese for 7$\u2026 absolutely hilarious. Also made me wait 15 minutes for said plain bagel, had me thinking it was ready to eat until I made it to my gate and was gravely disappointed that I had just spent 15$ on a tiny gross iced coffee and a bagel that I have to spread my own cheese on. What a joke! John was AWESOME! very prompt and i was super indecisive about an the entire team was amazing i ordered 3 times there! my go-to spot now Bro what. My $20 bill couldn't cover a coffee and sandwich??? Coffee tastes fine but there is absolutely no reason for this. I'm so utterly disgusted by how this company is taking advantage of people. I'd rather go starving than to eat here again. Also my $16 sandwich? It was tiny. Everything was so thin I'm actually furious that I let myself believe this place might be okay. I could've gone anywhere else and I'm upset with myself that I didn't. Update: I'm not a big man, about 160 lbs 5'8\", but after spending $25 at Berkshire farms market I am still hungry. Dear establishment, if you are going to charge that much that is one thing but at the very least make it worth it. My recommendation would be 20-24oz coffees and sandwiches that aren't made for children. Super convenient location as it's open 24/7. I had the tuna salad sandwich. It was one of the best tuna sandwich I ever had. The French bread was soft. The tuna salad had a delicate balance of green onion and salt. I added cheddar cheese and avocado. The sandwich not big like a subway sandwich was 10.00 pricey but worth it. The sandwich without the add ons is 7.99.\n\nPs. Of course this location has alot of panhandling proceed with caution. So I don\u2019t usually have this problem at Au bon pain but tonight I  had an extremely horrible experience. Apparently during shift change, they close the store and no one wanted to come to the window to explain that to many us waiting outside. Finally the big guy came to the window yelling what didn\u2019t we understand that they were changing shifts. I told him I\u2019ve never experienced this and he just shut the window without given any info. And he said that he was busy doing other things and didn\u2019t have time to come to the window to explain. Very very RUDE. I was choked and I have a picture of him not caring for their customers. Nice bakery with great extended hours for patients family and health workers. Clean healthy food choices. I absolutely love Steven's attitude\u2014he's such a great manager! Every time I see him, he puts a smile on my face with his kindness and positivity.Thank you for making my caramel fraps taste amazing you\u2019re the best! The manager is a great guy. The rest of the staff are hardworking and kind. The food and coffee are always delicious. There was only one person working the cashier that I could see, but they were courteous and served every patron quickly. The food quality was ok at best, but I was hungry and I needed some food. Overall it's not the worst thing in the airport and if the lines are short, you can get served quickly. Waited 40 minutes in line to get a sausage, egg, and cheese on a croissant..... that ended up being in a bagel. Not for lack of croissants (the boyfriend still got a croissant). Food not cooked long enough and the bagel replacement I got wasn't even toasted. Recommendation is to look elsewhere if you're hungry at terminal C. Never eat here ever!! They put a worker who could barely speak English. I wanted the bacon snackers on the side and he order 2 sadnwhiches?? The croissants were stale and so dry basically crumbling apart. Donut was dry too. The hasbrowns were disgusting and fell apart upon picking it up. It took 20 minutes to order and the drinks were terrible! Terrible coffee. Basically paying for expensive milk. I had to buy 3 extra expresso shots to make it \u201cnormal\u201d it looked like a milky latte. Guy was not friendly at all. Even though I paid for the extra shots. I get the same coffee every day. I am sick of going to the places that are ripping everyone off! Spanish girl in the morning around 4:30am is VERY RUDE. She never wants to make my food when I order. She tells her co workers to make it whenever I order.\n\nFor example , I wanted my hash browns extra crispy and the cashier looks at me like if it\u2019s a big deal. When she tells the Spanish girl my request the Spanish girl always makes a face like if I ruined her day and then she says to her co worker to make my order instead of her. It\u2019s not a big deal at all.\n\nThe team doesn\u2019t communicate well. If I order my food new or extra crispy they make it a big deal. I\u2019m just a customer that likes my food a certain way.\n\nI would like to speak to the manager Fast service, and the breakfast burrito hit the spot in the morning before my flight. The breakfast burrito had eggs, potatoes, bacon and some sauce. All of the ingredients were quality and tasted great together. I would recommend this place to grab a bite before heading out on a flight. Ingredients a bit cold (compared to Chipotle) but it\u2019s indeed a good chicken bowl Wifi was down so they said they couldn\u2019t sell any food. Window full of food ready to be made into burritos. Would hate to be the owner with these guys running it. Nice mexican fast food place at Boston Logan airport.\nFood is pretty good with different options. You can create your own burrito or bowl and choose meat, beans and toppings.\nThere are several tables and high chairs for sitting there.\nIt's right next to the escalator so it's a little noisy there. food tasted fine but 60 min later my stomach was upside down and now i\u2019m sick on my flight. i took a bit of a risk it felt like with their breakfast food but figured it would be fine. it was not fine \" Wow ; the street taco breakfast is joyfully delicious \"\nCan you say yummy ?  The street taco breakfast has my stomach doing cartwheels it's that good .  On the tortilla it has maple syrup and it's good .  The service is really good especially for a chain restaurant.  The food is super delicious especially for a chain restaurant.   The vibe is upbeat and friendly .  The name is right on for the vibration of the restaurant.  Parking is in abundance as it is in a mall .   The price is reasonable for the portion size and quality. Delicious food and excellent service!! We shared the French Toast sticks with hot jam, I definitely recommend them for a sweet start! I had the vegan scramble--excellent. The vegan sausage has great flavor. My daughter loves their grilles cheese. Their cocktails are excellent. I recommend the cocktail flights. I've tried them all-very fun way to have a drink! This is like an atypical diner with all your usuals and more. We got their weekly special green omelette, chicken and waffles, beef bulgogi bowl, and the snap crackle cluck. Everything was good, well seasoned. The waffles had a sweetness to it with bits of bacon. The waffle fries are so good. The beef bowl was very unexpectedly delicious. I didn't think mayo with bulgogi would vibe, but it did! We went at an off time so there weren't a lot of folks dining with us to tell how the staff would be when it's busier, but they were great when we went. Food was really good ... there are vegetarian options but not too many. BFF got the chicken & waffles with a side of tots and I got the hash quiche with sweet potatoes hash and fruit w/ raisin bread toast. The drinks were really good too! We are vegetarians and were glad to find this place to have brunch on a Sunday. We ordered Vegan Scrambled Tofu, Sam\u2019s Garden Omelette, and Harsh Quiche with no bacon. The quantity was large and we were very full after finished all meals. Every lampshade is different in the store and decor is colorful. We had the best breakfast in the airport! They have fresh eggs for sandwiches, breakfast plates, and omelets. My family loved their bacon eggs and cheese sandwiches and my western omelet was delicious. The staff was also friendly and quick. Will be eating breakfast every time we fly! Literally so nasty. No seriously this pizza is gross. The pepperonis all fell off the moment I picked my pizza up. One of my pepperonis rolled across the floor when I grabbed my slice. There is almost no sauce whatsoever and the cheese was dry with absolutely no stretch to it. The guy was rude and I almost cancelled my order from how he was talking to the customers. I only ate here because my flight was delayed. Will never come back. Do not bother unless you want overpriced mediocre reheated pizza.\n\nSimilar to other reviews for this location, the employee was not pleasant and made us not even want to order.\n\nMy kid really wanted pizza, so I agree and overpaid at almost $7 per SLICE for pizza they reheat in the oven.  Everyone else ordered elsewhere and had better food for similar prices. Bought this pizza and two more slices for my husband since the pizza looked good but unfortunately, it might be artificial food coloring to give the illusion of a fresh pizza. Yuck! The dough is so chewy and it tastes stale. Perhaps the most money I've ever paid for a slice of pizza: $4.79. We also bought a two layer pizza which was $6.47! And it feels it was deep fried in oil. Ugh! Wow I think I just had my best airport breakfast ever here. Sandwich was made to order and it came out hot, fresh and tasty. The egg in my sandwich was cracked and cooked in front of my eyes. It was Friday 6:30 am but it only took them 5 minutes to give me my food.\nThe price is also super reasonable. I will get my breakfast here again next time. Martin went above and beyond to fulfill my order! I love the Jalapeno Cheddar bagels and there's no more Au Bon Pain stores around so I called the store and asked him to hold 8 for me. He kept in touch and made sure he would have it ready for this day. He gave me hot and fresh ones and a ton of spreads! Thanks again for your service and fulfilling my request! . Update on May 22 . Coffee as usual cold not hot enough when mix the milk\nPrevious\n. I am a long time dyalsis patient and get my dyalsis at Elmhurst hospital where in the basement Au bon pain has a cafe .three times a week before going to dyalsis I came here and get two toasted bagels . Today as usual I came ordered the two toasted sasme bagel with jelly and stand waited . All of sudden from my right side ( I have two major hip replacements at this side ) fell on me .I fell on the table ( water bottles kept on those tables) my face down . I had no idea who fell on me a black guy who had a hospital ID hanging his neck hold me and help me standing holding . I was shivering I was also wondering why I am shivering so bad . He asked are you ok . Can you stand by yourself I was feeling a little pinch in my hip which was unusual .I stand and looked at the guy who feel on me he was a employee here at au bon pain .he said he is sorry he slipped because the floor was wet it's not his fault and he try to hold me so I don't fell face down . As I already paid for the bagels I told the manager ( a Pakistani guy ) that I already paid you I am leaving he was busy as usual and didn't give a dam ( could be checked on cameras all that incident time was 2:00 pm . A customer young lady with her daughter in stroller was there ( she was there for oatmeal but as the au bon pain didn't have it she bought almond milk ) She told me you are still shivering are you ok I said yes I am going to get my dyalsis I am feeling pain but what else I can do . She said this is my number I am the witness you need any help I am available . Right now I am getting my dyalsis and feeling some strange tickling and little pain on the right side hip replacement .what should I do now .any one please give me some advice .thanks God bless all of you Ameen This is a lopsided review. I've always liked Au Bon Pain so it pains me to have to give a negative review. I was at my dialysis session and had a friend of mine order lunch for me. I text her the following: Green tea (lots of honey), a Caprese with chicken sandwich and a palmier cookie. After she dropped it off, and having a bit of tea I unwrapped the sandwich and took  bite. There was no mozzarella, tomato, arugula, or pesto. This is not a Caprese Sandwich (I said to myself). It's those ingredients that actually makes it a Caprese. So I decided to hold off (after one bite) and would take it back for what I asked for. After showing them my text, the cashier and woman behind the counter said the young lady that put in the order asked for a chicken sandwich and would not replace my order. I thought this was a bit rediculous since I'm not the one that made the mistake and thought they should honor my request (after all I've been a loyal customer for all the seven years I've been on dialysis).  I was about go, leaving the sandwich right where I placed it on the counter. They decided to redress the sandwich with arugula and tomatoes and wrapped it back up. I was like, that's still not a Caprese without pesto or mozzarella. They just glared at me. I just grabbed it and left. It's going to be a treat for my lovely pet when I get home. Last time I frequent this location of Au Bon Pain, with an emphasis on PAIN here \ud83d\ude14 \u203c\ufe0f I often buy sandwiches here for lunch, but I had a bad experience here today. I was ordering a caramel macchiato without milk, and the man behind the counter said in a sarcastic way that they don\u2019t make caramel macchiato without milk and addded that macchiato is always made with milk. Is it hard for him not to put milk on it? Like what I ask from Dunkin Donuts and they just put sweetener or vanilla cream? You have to teach this employee of yours some costumer service manners. I love this bakery! I had to undergo a mental therapy program for a few weeks or so 2 months and I always went here after I ate. The BLT is so good and they always toast it to perfection. The cheddar broccoli soup is to die for and so is the strawberry lemonade! You should definitely go here if you want a afternoon snack or brunch/lunch! This place isnt usually packed and full of delights from pastries to fully loaded sandwiches! Also, when there was a romaine lettuce outbreak, they acted quickly and used other produce like arugula! I love it here and I can\u2019t wait to come back and have a snack! Came here on Sunday trip, met Danny and other staffs, they great ppl and Harbor House wont disapoint u guys. Jackie was amazing! I had tons of questions about anti-inflammatory properties of different products. She was super patient and we talked about our dogs. Love Harbor House and everyone there! I gave HH a 3 star only cause the deals they have are amazing sometimes and some of the bud tender are amazing with their customer service. Now the front desk is where I\u2019m always having an issue and if not me someone else. I\u2019ve never been to a dispensary where front desk staff is running out to the parking lot looking in peoples cars.  That\u2019s just wild to me! Every dispensary in MA that I\u2019ve been to worry about what\u2019s going on in the building not a parking lot! What\u2019s ever what\u2019s even better is they also think they run the establishment. Denying a frequent customer who in 6 weeks spent $1000.  The front desk girl should worry about just checking ids and not trying to\nmake manager decisions.  Other then that shout out to the bud tender again for fixing front desk check in awful customer service! Corey, Tahnaree and April all are awesome.  Everyone who works there is.  Kind people, great weed, great prices and great vibes.  I\u2019ll always show love to those that show love.   Remember, it\u2019s not about how we fall it\u2019s about how we pick ourselves up and carry ourselves out the darkness.  Also my Yocan Orbit, great for concentrates.  Takes a bit to get used to but great for on go or at home.  , Everyone goes above and beyond always.  Biodiesel is my favorite strain here.  I also like Kosher Kush and Albari\u00f1o a lot.  The gummies are fantastic too.  The vapes chefs kiss. Jackie at the front desk was the highlight of my day!! From helping find what I need in the quality to the quantity and completely understanding my odd needs. Thank you for being awesome!! Will definitely recommend! The location is one of the best qualities! If you are lucky you can sit out in the deck in the nicer weather for a beautiful view right on the water. The food was decent. The margaritas were great! Was having a family dinner, it was a family favorite due to the service! Really enjoyable experience.\nStaff were lovely - food was excellent would definitely go back. The views were great and the lobster guacamole was my fav in a long time For a place named \u201ctortas and tequila,\u201d it was extremely disappointing. There\u2019s absolutely no tortas on the menu and By far the worst Margarita I\u2019ve ever had. It tasted like ballpark nacho jalape\u00f1os with a shot of tequila. Gross. Ordered a Bloody Mary to start it was by far the worse I\u2019ve ever had. There was no flavor and just tasted like tequila in tomato juice. Had both pork and chicken quesadillas and again no flavor at all, it tasted like the meat was boiled in a bag and placed in between a tortilla and cheese. It is extremely over priced even for airport prices with no value to their food and I forgot to mention their service or lack thereof. Do not eat here!!! I wasn't able to order a margarita through the online menu because it listed that they were out of stock of all tequilas but one, and it wouldn't let me select that one either.  When the waitress brought our food, she was able to place the order for us though.  The salsa and chips had a distinct flavor, individually they were a little weird but together it actually worked.  The chicken on my nachos seemed like maybe it was dumped out of a Swanson's can.  When I finally did get the margarita, it was actually pretty good. Mike at the bar was absolutely amazing! Everything he recommended was so good! We have ate at airport restaurants and been extremely disappointed, this place is on point! Please visit if you have a layover here.\nTake care of out bartender Mike! He is a good one. I never have a bad experience here. Most airport restaurants suck, quite frankly.\n\nEvery time I fly home from Boston I stop here prior to my flight for a seafood kick. I usually get the friend whole belly clams, sometimes I get the petite lobster roll with chowder.\n\nAlways good service. Only complaint is it\u2019s cramped, but that\u2019s to be expected at an airport restaurant. A little oasis away from the chaos of Logan Airport! Legal Sea Foods has one of the best lobster rolls we\u2019ve ever tried (we\u2019ve been so many places and theirs just hits the nail on the head anytime we go) and the airport location is no exception. It is REALLY expensive - that would be my only complaint - but I guess if you\u2019re stuck at the airport you don\u2019t really have any other option. At least you can get a lobster roll here\u2026other airports force you to have junky fast food and that\u2019s it! Our recent visit had great views, excellent service, and we were in and out pretty quickly. We got a regular and gluten-free lobster roll and they were excellent - you wouldn\u2019t miss out on anything if you needed to get the gluten-free one. We would absolutely come again next time we\u2019re at the Logan Airport with some time to spare! Terrible!   I cannot believe this is Legal Seafood.   I have been a loyal customer for 44 years, but my last 2 visits to Legals at Logan Airport terminal C have been terrible.    Last time I had a salad with \"grilled\" Tuna, and this time with \"grilled\" Salmon.   In both cases it was clear that the fish is being steamed or microwaved, not grilled.   No hint of grill marks or char.   The salmon in this photo was barely cooked.   I ordered it medium rare, which should be seared on the outside, and pink on the inside.\n\nFor $35, this is disgraceful.   Absolutely horrible.    What a waste of good fish. Legal has really gone downhill.  I remember it didn't matter which restaurant you tried (Harbor side, Burlington, Kendall Square, the Test Kitchen at the Boston airport, Atlanta) you would always have a best experience.\n\nOur last experience at Burlington was just so-so.\n\nAnd our latest meal at the converted Legal at the airport may be our final visit.  Prices have risen too much and the meal quality is way down.\n\nWe ordered 2 different salmon dinners.  My wife ordered Hoisin and it was properly prepared and very good.  I ordered the grilled salmon, medium rare, and I got medium.  I didn't complain to my server, I dislike doing that unless my food is not edible.  But c'mon, a high end seafood restaurant not knowing how to cook salmon?  (It doesn't help that in the past week I had an overcooked salmon at a different Boston restaurant - did the definition of medium rare change recently???)\n\nTwo photos show my \"medium rare\" salmon, one shows the properly cooked Hoisin (which was actually more moist inside than mine!).

LOVE that they have GF options. Usually hard to find GF in airports but there were a few listed options and come to find out that any bread can be subbed for gluten free (not stated outright but menu says something to the extent of \u201cask for gluten free options\u201d). Went for the New England Clam chowder (stated GF) and Burrata salad. Both excellent! Turkey club, burratta salad, hummus plate, and a local beer.  The turkey club was excellent,  grilled instead of toasted...  who would have thought of such a good idea...  making the bread much more moist.  Excellent.  The salad and hummus were great.  Good pick at the airport!!  The service was friendly, and the food came out fast.  The beer was cold.  Can't go wrong here. Wonderful meal, the atmosphere is about as good as an airport can get. I was Seated at the bar and had tremendous service. Mark was an amazing bartender and made all the right recommendations! Food is amazing here! Great service, food and drinks. Quick and easy, had chicken sandwich and truffle fries There was only one person working the cashier that I could see, but they were courteous and served every patron quickly. The food quality was ok at best, but I was hungry and I needed some food. Overall it's not the worst thing in the airport and if the lines are short, you can get served quickly.

They put a worker who could barely speak English. I wanted the bacon snackers on the side and he order 2 sadnwhiches?? The croissants were stale and so dry basically crumbling apart. Donut was dry too. The hasbrowns were disgusting and fell apart upon picking it up. It took 20 minutes to order and the drinks were terrible! Terrible coffee. Basically paying for expensive milk.

They have gotten free but it\u2019s not very tasty either. And please clean the ovens, the pizzas aren\u2019t burnt but they come out with a burnt smell on them because the ovens have pieces of crust burning in them. You can smell it through half the terminal. I ordered the four cheese pizza and my boyfriend had the lobster roll. The food was very good despite the high airport prices. The guy at the counter was helpful when ordering. The pizza place is in a good location for accessibility (outside of TSA to the right). The four cheese pizza was very delicious!! Staff was nice. It was expensive for the size but that\u2019s what i\u2019d expect from airport restaurants so whateverrrrr!! Size, Taste, and Prize just didn\u2019t go together. The tables were dirty and the chairs had previous customers\u2019 left overs. Staff didn\u2019t appear to care. Not fitting the name! To say we would NOT recommend this place is an understatement. I fly through Logan a good bit and had never stopped here but decided to as I had such an early flight and breakfast pizza sounded good. The pizza was  very over cooked as were the luke warm and over cooked eggs they just threw in the top. Never have I seen a breakfast pizza look like this before. If you\u2019ve never been it\u2019s probably fine but if you remember what Johnny Rockets used to be, exceptionally disappointing. They have the same names but are not the same at all. Service was not good, people line up right behind you if you\u2019re sitting at the counter making it feel exceptionally claustrophobic. Love the retro feel. Food is usually great. Yesterday when I ordered though. The fryolator was showing the check fluid message. I\u2019m going to give it the benefit of the doubt and say yes the oil is being checked. But it is a red flag (from a distance) that proper checks aren\u2019t being done. There was no flavor to the Philly Cheesesteak, the hot dog for kids tasted gross and overcooked. The fries did not have any salt. The most blandest meal I have ever had. Would not go again. False advertising today at least, went at 11:30 am, no one was there, but everything else in the food court was open. At 11:45, someone was starting to open up, and she said another thirty minutes. Except, Google says this location opens at 11am. I've had the food before, lots of french fries and the chicken sandwich was good. I just wish that they would open on time as advertised. This has happened to me before.\n\nUpdate 7/31/23 they were open today, and they truly are good, but $11 for 1 sandwich? Popeyes literally next door, would give you a sandwich, fries and drink for that price, probably less. I love this place the staff is wonderful the food is wonderful everybody is so kind here and it's better than McDonald's we've rather come here than go anywhere else we come here every time we go to the mall and we love it There was only one person working the cashier that I could see, but they were courteous and served every patron quickly. The food quality was ok at best, but I was hungry and I needed some food. Overall it's not the worst thing in the airport and if the lines are short, you can get served quickly. Waited 40 minutes in line to get a sausage, egg, and cheese on a croissant..... that ended up being in a bagel. Not for lack of croissants (the boyfriend still got a croissant). Food not cooked long enough and the bagel replacement I got wasn't even toasted. Recommendation is to look elsewhere if you're hungry at terminal C. Never eat here ever!! They put a worker who could barely speak English. I wanted the bacon snackers on the side and he order 2 sadnwhiches?? The croissants were stale and so dry basically crumbling apart. Donut was dry too. The hasbrowns were disgusting and fell apart upon picking it up. It took 20 minutes to order and the drinks were terrible! Terrible coffee. Basically paying for expensive milk. I had to buy 3 extra expresso shots to make it \u201cnormal\u201d it looked like a milky latte. Guy was not friendly at all. Even though I paid for the extra shots. I get the same coffee every day. I am sick of going to the places that are ripping everyone off! Spanish girl in the morning around 4:30am is VERY RUDE. She never wants to make my food when I order. She tells her co workers to make it whenever I order.\n\nFor example , I wanted my hash browns extra crispy and the cashier looks at me like if it\u2019s a big deal. When she tells the Spanish girl my request the Spanish girl always makes a face like if I ruined her day and then she says to her co worker to make my order instead of her. It\u2019s not a big deal at all.\n\nThe team doesn\u2019t communicate well. If I order my food new or extra crispy they make it a big deal. I\u2019m just a customer that likes my food a certain way.\n\nI would like to speak to the manager There was only one person working the cashier that I could see, but they were courteous and served every patron quickly.

I\u2019m just a customer that likes my food a certain way.\n\nI would like to speak to the manager Anytime there\u2019s a suggestion to go to Trade, the answer is automatically an \u201cabsolutely.\u201d This is definitely a top 10 restaurant in Boston, the definition of a 5 star restaurant that nails it every time we\u2019ve been with their attentive service, their stellar atmosphere, and their perfect food. I\u2019m surprised (and grateful) that this place isn\u2019t being stormed or constantly overbooked.\n\nBefore we get to the food, it needs to be mentioned how well this place is managed by John and how attentive everyone is. The staff makes an effort to take care of you. The ambiance of the restaurant is also elegant and charming.\n\nEach time I went, we ordered a lot of food, so we\u2019ve covered most of the menu, everything has always been great, but here is my recommendations:\n\nShrimp and Garlic - this is a must, no negotiations, order it. I\u2019ve had this dish in other places, Trade takes the crown on this one. Use the bread that comes with it to dip it in the sauce.\n\nWhen you order the Fried Cauliflower, use some of the bread that comes with the Shrimp and Garlic (since you\u2019re definitely going to order it) and dip it in the sauce of the Cauliflower.\n\nFor the main, either the Herb Crusted Lamb Chops or Whole Roasted Branzino. It all depends if you\u2019re in the mood for seafood or meat, both or great options.\n\nDo not dare to skip on dessert and go straight for the Burnt Orange Phyllo Bread Pudding.\n\nHighly recommend this restaurant, will continue to come again and again. The baklava is creative!! I've never tasted a baklava like this before. The mushroom pizzette is my favorite, the fig on it makes it more special. The environment and service are all perfect! The midday menu doesn't contain many dishes so I'd definitely dine again during dinner time. We were a large party and we were visiting this place for the first time. We were celebrating one of our friend's birthday so people were in all fun moods. We ordered a lot of food, and it took us time to decide and order. The server was a little upset about that, and it showed from his behavior when he took our order. He wasn't responding to us, and it felt like he was annoyed. I understand the frustration, but when there is a large party, it takes time to finalize the order.\n\nThe food here was delicious. We repeated so many dishes, and I think eventually after seeing that the server was okay.\nTheir eggplant dish was our favorite, baked feta phyllo was also really good.\n\nThey don't allow outside cake in the restaurant, so if you plan to cake a cut in the restaurant, then they don't allow you to do it.\n\nAlthough they were kind to give us disposable spoons so we could cut the cake outside and enjoy it. Had an incredible night at Trade with my husband celebrating our anniversary. We had a 7:15 reservation and our table was ready for us when we got there. From ambiance to food, everything was perfect. Our server was attentive, food was very flavorful, drinks were good and strong, and the place is so beautiful and romantic. We had pita and meze spreads, tuna tartare, whole branzino and vegetable moussaka and we recommend everything. The baklava pistachio wafer is so creative and has a nice presentation too. We'll definitely come back! We recently celebrated my best friend\u2019s birthday at Trade and it was an unforgettable experience! The hospitality was outstanding, making us feel truly special. The service was amazing and the food was absolutely delicious, adding to a perfect celebration! Highly recommend it! They don\u2019t show gluten free on the menu, but if you do ask about gluten free bread, they just might have it! The male employee checked for me and instructed on how to order. On the tablet under special request, type \u201cGluten Free Bread (Gluten Allergy).\u201d Turned out to be the best airport meal for me, getting to experience a local Boston spot! The Steak and Cheese and Roast Beef Sandwiches were so killer. So happy I got to eat them!! And I did not get sick! Thanks for including gluten free, Kelly\u2019s! I know 4 is high for any airport restaurant.\nKelly\u2019s is better than average. Good menu, they may have gluten free rolls (you have to ask and they\u2019ll check), the bacon cheeseburger is always actually pretty good and the fries are hot and crispy 8 times out of 10.  Decent pricing, good folks working there. Go to for lunch in terminal B Kelly\u2019s Roast Beef, Logan International Airport.\n\nStopped in for a quick bite. Self Order using a tablet.\n\nOrdered a roast beef sandwich.  Arrived cold and warm as if it were heated in a microwave oven.\n\nDespite the odd temp, roast beef was a bit on the salty side but otherwise acceptable for airport fare.\n\nGreat service. Needed lemonade while waiting for our 6am flight. Manager no problem sold it to me before they were open. Got a breakfast sandwich and came with potato\u2019s, probably more food and for the same price as pot belly across the way. 4.9 for an airport bar/grill this was perfect.  Beer was SUPER cold on draft.  I got the turkey club wrap and it was perfect.  Wife got the fish sandwich and it was delish.  I know it\u2019s odd to review an airport spot, but we WILL be back here in future flights. This was the BEST airport fast food I've ever had. The chicken quesadilla was delicious. I ordered on a kiosk and the food came out quickly. There was plenty of comfortable seating right by there to sit and eat before my flight. I was delightfully surprised by this find. Aside from being a bit pricey ($22 for chicken quesadilla and guac) I loved Tico's.  First time eating here. Won't be my last. Two thumbs up!! My sister and I were very happy with our dinners. Only thing missing was a margarita!! The food is good but NOT $25 good! This price for one Quesadilla and to be charged for salsa, sour cream and guak all over $2 each and SMALL portions. Crazy!! Definitely do not recommend coming here unless you want to pay an arm and leg for food you get better at a sit down restaurant and cheaper. Thank God for a GF experience! We were seduced into Cisco Brewery for their *GF* nachos, and then they told us that their chips are fried in the same oil as the chicken. Not at Tico! Chipotle chicken tacos on corn tortillas and chips and guacamole were super yummy! Food court style, but food was worth it! Burrito - 2/5\nChips - 2/5\nSalsa - 4/5\nGuac - 1/5\nTacos - 4/5\n\nBurrito was mid at best. Tacos were solid. Chips were tostitos - no good. Salsa was kinda fire. Guacamole was literally just avacado and lime. And it still cost $50. One of the kiosks was broken and it kept trying to sell us dr. pepper. Go to Legal Seafoods The whole sweet potato fries was burnt and tasteless. The taste of the chicken was not good enough. The worst food I ever bought. Don't waste your money.  I wish there was a zero rating. Service was pretty quick. You order and pay at a machine which helps keep the lines moving pretty steadily. I decided to splurge a little and got the farmhouse burger which was pretty good. The meat tasted like a decent quality and above par for fast food. You are in the airport so I guess that along with the better quality is why it came with the $10 price tag for just the burger. The fries were okay but $4.30 was a little steep in my opinion for the size but they did seem like they were fresh cut so I'll give them that. I just personally like my fries crunchy on the outside while meaty on the inside. These were kind of floppy and soft but at near they were skinny and overcooked. I guess that's the thing with fries, everyone has a different preference.\n\nThe wife had the Beyond chicken tender sandwich. She said it was good and that she'd order it again in the future. It was her first time trying the Beyond chicken. I'd only heard of the sausages and burgers. Coming in at $13, that Beyond stuff is typically around that price so no complaints.\n\nThey have a couple tables to sit at in the immediate area but you'll more than likely need to grab your bag and hele on. I will admit that it was way less expensive than the place next door, so there was that plus too. Ordering was extremely easy at a self-checkout kiosk. Food didn\u2019t take too long to come out, I got mine in less than 10 mins.\n\nIngredients seemed high quality and tasted good. There\u2019s a small seating area with about ~9 tables, and they\u2019re moderately busy around lunch time.\n\nYou can also order to-go. It was less than $13 for quinoa bowl (spicy avocado quinoa bowl). Overall, good experience. Got the a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl and no exaggeration it was frozen ice chunks and some a\u00e7a\u00ed liquid. For 12 dollars. It was also less than half full bowl. They were quick on the service and nice enough customer service wise. Got no complaints and my food was good. Fries could have been more hot, but still a good experience overall. Food was what you would expect from pizza. I tried mashed potatoes, bacon, and scallion slice. Not sure if it had a sauce to speak of. Could\u2019ve used a bit more cheese.  But the toppings were pretty good. And they did heated up in the oven before serving it. The best thing about eating here was the price. $5 was pretty good for a good sized slice. The closest burger a few doors down was about $12 and the burrito next door was over 3x the price. So I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to eat here if you need something quick and fairly tasty. Average with $$ price tag.\n.\nGot a pepperoni, thin slice, Owen toasted, bit salty than the usual. $5.5 per slice is ridiculous.\n.\nWho cares airport restaurants are built to fleece weary travelers!!! I tried a slice of the pepperoni, but I\u2019m not a fan\u2026... It was fairly flavorless - the crust, the cheese and the sauce, though the pepperoni was good. There is much better pizza around!!\nStaff was friendly ! The employees are very nice but the guy who made our pizza doesn't know how to make pizza. We ordered a 12 inch vegan pizza, I appreciated the fact they carry vegan cheese (violife brand), but the guy put so much cheese that it just leaked through the entire crust and the pizza was a complete mush and not edible. We were super hungry so we somehow managed to eat half of it but the other half just went to the garbage unfortunately, and I rarely throw food away.  We paid $20 for it. Not bad for a quick pizza to hold you over until your flight. Both our slices were decent and affordable compared to other places here to eat. Ordered fries and a turkey sandwich. Expensive, but so is all airport food. Fries were so hot and crispy.\n\nService was good. Not super friendly, but kind and helpful which I appreciate. The market located between gates, B 29 and B 37 in the food market area made a great breakfast sandwich for me. Service was friendly and the sandwich is made quite quickly. Great place! Make sure you check your order before you exit. I spent almost $20 on a breakfast sandwich and drink. When I sat down my order was not correct, the cashier rang it up right. The cook was not willing to replace my sandwich. Not very customer service friendly. Awful and expensive! One single slice of cheese, one single slice of salami, one single slice of mortadella, I opened before I walked out as it felt so light, they say that\u2019s how the owners told them to make it! That came from the supervisor!! The food was not great and over priced.  The employees were not inviting at all.  We should have gone to starbucks next door, but were in a hurry. The thing that's more upsetting is they charged me for my daughters drink and then went and charged her for the same drink.  I realized the double charge once we were on the plane.  I called them and the number on the receipt was a previous owners.  I'm going to file a dispute with my bank for the price difference.  I wonder how many other people were over charged. There was only one person working the cashier that I could see, but they were courteous and served every patron quickly. The food quality was ok at best, but I was hungry and I needed some food. Overall it's not the worst thing in the airport and if the lines are short, you can get served quickly. Waited 40 minutes in line to get a sausage, egg, and cheese on a croissant..... that ended up being in a bagel. Not for lack of croissants (the boyfriend still got a croissant).

They have gotten free but it\u2019s not very tasty either. And please clean the ovens, the pizzas aren\u2019t burnt but they come out with a burnt smell on them because the ovens have pieces of crust burning in them.

For airport food, it's pretty decent!  My husband got the orange chicken, and it was really good.  He had no complaints.  I got the chicken chow mein - it was good but just a little dry and a little lacking flavor.  But overall, they were good portions and fair prices (considering that it's in the airport).  Overall, it's a decent place to go to while waiting for your flight! Pei Wei Spicy Chicken $16.59\n\nSmelled strange (like dusts...)\nTaste is not too bad (not good but I was hungry so...)\nThe rice was good (I like harder rice) Oct. 27, 2024\nThe food was decent, but despite the sign saying they open at 9 am, they didn\u2019t actually open until almost 9:20am. The girl at the register was rude. I\u2019m giving three stars only because the food was alright. If she doesn\u2019t want to work or provide good service, she should look for another job instead of ruining other people\u2019s day. The orange chicken was $15.\u00a0 It had about 2/3 of the container filled up with white rice and only 5 pieces of orange chicken. You would get more food for $15 in other places at the airport. Sad. $16 for a plate full of rice and little else. Takes way too long. 15-20 mins even when I was only one of two people in line. And very expensive.\n\nThe sole positive of this place is I could tell the woman working the counter tried to wipe excess spillage off plates before serving them.\n\nEDITEE: Wrote the above before eating it. Upon eating it it tasted terrible. Hard rice and super tough chicken. Absolutely nothing close to tasting like actual Pei Wei. Honestly tasted as bad as the food served on flights. guys. for airport food this is insane value. why are the ratings so low. BTW pretty sure this is in terminal B (that\u2019s where I got it as of dec 10), but incredibly reasonable prices for a hefty sandwich. $11.65 for a generous portion of protein and u get unlimited toppings????? and it moves super fast. and it\u2019s always toasted. i am shocked that i got this at an airport.\n\nthis is just their original classic or whatever, with \u201cthe works\u201d. yum!!! Mediterranean sub, excellent toasted bread, flavorful mix, slightly spicy added spark. I'd order again. This Potbelly is located right in the terminal B near gate 12. Full service sandwich restaurant with all different choices. I went with the Italian on white and hot peppers. Very delicious sandwich. They also offered different flavors of potato chips and various drinks. This was my first visit to the Potbelly shop, and I gotta say, the customer service was wicked good. The staff offered me two sandwiches instead of one big one for the same price, gave me a bunch of veggie options, and they were absolutely delicious! Had a great experience this trip through BOS. The turkey and Swiss was very good. It was as toasted to perfection! So much better than a subway, but what isn't? Now I came through there last year and wanted a shake, only to find out they didn't have any. They don\u2019t show gluten free on the menu, but if you do ask about gluten free bread, they just might have it! The male employee checked for me and instructed on how to order.

Only complaint I have is the app said they were closed until 430 but they were clearly open. Terrible service, terrible attitudes, very slow.  We were fifth in line and waited more than twenty minutes for our food.  We finally left without getting what we ordered because our flight was boarding.  I have never seen \"workers\" move at a slower place and have total indifference for their customers.  Starbucks, you need to go in and do a lot more training and replace some employees. Never has life imitated a Seinfeld episode more than at the Starbucks in Terminal B at Logan. I ordered a decaf latte. The server repeated back ok one decaf skinny latte. I said, I didn\u2019t order that. Whole milk is fine. My receipt reflected 2%.\n\nEvidently, the sever felt I needed a diet? Two stars - one for the lackluster service and one for the laugh. Absolutely awful latte and terrible service. Ordered a quad shot 20oz latte. The milk was burnt and you couldn\u2019t taste any espresso. I threw the drink in the trash after one sip and did not insist on a refund. That barista 100% hates her job and it shows \u2014 How sad. This is the most foul and disgraceful Starbucks I have ever been to. I mobile ordered, when I got there they rudely informed me that they only had coconut milk. I asked to cancel the order which I used both money and stars on. I asked if the stars would be credited to my account and the lady rolled her eyes at me, said she didn\u2019t know, and turned around so someone else could answer my question which is no. Apparently I have to call Starbucks myself to get my star refund for an order they could not complete. Also the order still is not cancelled on my end so they also took $7 from me for nothing. What a terrible experience this morning. This is the Starbucks at Terminal A Gates 13-22.\n\nThe baristas are very sweet but the lines are long thanks to constant demand. So if you're thinking of grabbing a drink before your flight, time it and prepare for 15-20 min. Otherwise everything was prepared right and well. At 0500 the line was already long. The folks were trying to get the orders thru, just really slow. Too early. Got to the counter after being called Next, then he excused himself to put trash liners in the trash cans. The next cashier called 3 other folks while I waited for the Young Man to complete his task \ud83e\udd28\u2615. Probably shouldn't rate until I finish my Mocha \ud83e\udd2d This Starbucks is horrible!!! I love Starbucks and usually have a high tolerance for issues. However, the line took forever as the cashier was so slow and kept talking to his friends without taking the customers orders. And then, the workers were extremely slow and making fun of customers\u2019 orders. There is no respect. Furthermore, the cashier overcharged me for my drink and it ended up tasting horribly!! Do not come here. The manager should get their workers under control. My entire order was not done as I asked for it , and when received it was not mixed well and the (green powder) was all over my clothes.\nI want back To them asking them to fix it and they were not responsive, I ended up leaving and not receiving my drink.\nBad . Bad . Bad Daughter placed order to be made with soy milk. However the barista  made it with a dairy milk  with red writing half half container   When my daughter gently pointed it out bc she cannot have dairy the barista  snapped at her and said  she did not use a dairy milk but used soy and then proceeded to ignore her. tje barista  made it as we watched so unless she put soy in the container with red half and half letters then that was an incorrect statement.   It then happened to someone else so now we think they may not have any soy or oat milk and didn\u2019t bother to tell anyone. Quite unfortunate, rude, disheartening and a waste of daughter\u2019s $9. My iced coffee was delicious. Ordered at 430 am. Only complaint I have is the app said they were closed until 430 but they were clearly open. Terrible service, terrible attitudes, very slow.  We were fifth in line and waited more than twenty minutes for our food.  We finally left without getting what we ordered because our flight was boarding.  I have never seen \"workers\" move at a slower place and have total indifference for their customers.  Starbucks, you need to go in and do a lot more training and replace some employees. Never has life imitated a Seinfeld episode more than at the Starbucks in Terminal B at Logan. I ordered a decaf latte. The server repeated back ok one decaf skinny latte. I said, I didn\u2019t order that. Whole milk is fine. My receipt reflected 2%.\n\nEvidently, the sever felt I needed a diet? Two stars - one for the lackluster service and one for the laugh.

At Logan terminal B, we enjoyed two wonderful Cappuccino\u2019s, medium size, served by an able guy. 12 bucks. The assorted baked goods looked inviting. Extremely expensive, better off buying from Hudson. I still can\u2019t believe I paid $10 for a skinny ass egg & cheese sandwich.\nNever getting food from the again.\n\nPs. This is a review for Peet\u2019s at Terminal E. Small but fast service, i loved that they were able to make my London fog tea. The food items are limited. Another guy near us got a sandwich and I asked how it was and he said cold in the center. The sandwiches are pre-made and just heated there. I purchased two bananas here because one wasn\u2019t enough. I tried to look for the most ripe bananas but they all looked a little sad. It was not busy and the guy was super helpful. The store brought forth emotional invigoration as I perused the small establishment to sustain my nutritional value of K+. $3.42 for 2 bananas \ud83c\udf4c in this economy. 2024, we need better representation. Grabbed a coffee and a bagel. The coffee is good but the bagel was lightly toasted but could not rip through it as it was maybe microwaved to defrost or something. Do not recommend at all as there is nothing more frustrating paying airport prices for something inedible.

Quite unfortunate, rude, disheartening and a waste of daughter\u2019s $9. management is abusive and terrible. nobody cleans properly and baristas serve expired food without a care in the world. working here and actually putting effort was a mistake. nobody cares about anything. they hiring minors and hood rats with no manners or dignity to what they\u2019re doing. shift leads and assistant managers harass minors because they have a higher position and take for granted. please avoid this place if possible. DO NOT give them any of your money, it\u2019s not worth it. just take the extra 10 minute drive to the next local starbucks at Orient Heights Worst Starbucks in Boston. Whether you order from the app or through the drive-thru, they still ask you what you ordered at the window. Then proceed to take about 15 more minutes to gather your drink after already waiting behind ONE other car for 15 minutes. For reference i order a sweet cream cold brew. The drinks are always very inconsistent and I\u2019m never able to finish them because they don\u2019t taste like they\u2019re meant for human consumption. I gave it a few tries. Would avoid. I ordered an iced apple crisp non dairy cream chai, a plain bagel with cream cheese, a mozzarella string cheese, and a birthday cake pop. The store had none of these in stock, despite them being on the mobile app when I placed the order. However, the staff was apologetic and politely asked if I wanted to make a replacement order.\nI ordered the cold brew with vanilla sweet cream non dairy cold foam, even though I haven't enjoyed Starbucks' cold brews in the past. The batista who assisted me that the sweet cream was enough not to have to add more milk or cream. When I received my order, though, the drink was as bitter as every other Starbucks cold brew I've ever had. I had asked for 10 sugars to account for the bitterness and the drink size, but the baristas never stir the drinks properly, so I'm sure all the sugar has settled on the bottom and the drink is still just as bitter.\nWhen I asked for a ham and Swiss croissant to replace the bagel, the barista was kind enough to give me an extra one. There were no more birthday cake pops so I asked for a racoon one, which the barista forgot, but I will go back and ask since I only noticed once I was out of the store. We drive through just now the girl say she cannot make a Frappuccino cause the dishes are in the sink what does it even that means ? Small coffee with cream and caramel is over $5 (flavor is $1 for three pumps \ud83d\ude02) then they want a tip too.  With as long as he took to ring it in I\u2019d be there god knows how long for them to Actually pour it and nobody else was there.\nBye.

Dingy old atmosphere. Needs major upgrade. Margherita pizza was not made correctly. It is not cheese pizza with more cheese on top. Disgusting. Lastly, they refused to give me a cup of hot water for my tea bag. They insisted I had to go to their cafe next door. Very obviously trying to force me to spend more money. I\u2019m already paying you for food. What a scammy place. First of all, thank you for having a vegan burger option! We got this option, it was simple but good, pricey though! The sweet potato fries are really good. The margarita pizza was good too. Our waiter Jonathan was nice. The restaurant is right next to the security line so not the best set up but at least you can check the cue and it is easy to access. Really excellent pepperoni pizza. Reasonably priced. Friendly and attentive service. Will definitely eat here again when next travelling through Logan. Nice quick bite to eat before we went into the International terminal. Pizza and Mediterranean Salad were delicious. Great beer, fantastic sea food. I ordered this 'catch of the day', which happened to be a salmon and I asked for it smoked - absolutely delicious. Good service too! The quality of their beans is exceptional, with every cup bursting with rich, nuanced flavors. Whether you\u2019re having a perfectly brewed pour-over or a velvety smooth latte, the attention to detail is evident. The atmosphere is cozy yet modern, making it a great spot to relax or get some work done. The staff is knowledgeable and passionate about coffee, always happy to share recommendations. If you\u2019re serious about good coffee, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommend! I liked the overall atmosphere of the cafe and the staff were very friendly. Everything was organised in a professional way, displaying their sources and products for you to browse while waiting. One thing that didn\u2019t quite scratch my itch in the cappuccino was the milk felt quite flat and lacked dimension, forcing the coffee to carry more weight of the experience. The coffee is pretty tasty. Would recommend. The staff was also kind, but very busy. Overall, it felt quite chaotic. So if that's not your jam, then avoid at peak hours. If it doesn't bother you, then definitely check this place out. Also, ordering online helps a ton. Coffee is excellent. Service was good. On a Saturday morning, it was pretty packed but there are lots of tables. Many people sit with computers for long periods of time though. They do not have gluten free bread here, so not many GF friendly options. Great coffee place in the heart of Boston across Macy's. Good quality coffee and tasty sweets. I had cappuccino and cranberry scone, UT was awesome. This is the Starbucks at Terminal A Gates 13-22.\n\nThe baristas are very sweet but the lines are long thanks to constant demand. So if you're thinking of grabbing a drink before your flight, time it and prepare for 15-20 min. Otherwise everything was prepared right and well. At 0500 the line was already long. The folks were trying to get the orders thru, just really slow. Too early. Got to the counter after being called Next, then he excused himself to put trash liners in the trash cans. The next cashier called 3 other folks while I waited for the Young Man to complete his task \ud83e\udd28\u2615. Probably shouldn't rate until I finish my Mocha \ud83e\udd2d This Starbucks is horrible!!! I love Starbucks and usually have a high tolerance for issues. However, the line took forever as the cashier was so slow and kept talking to his friends without taking the customers orders. And then, the workers were extremely slow and making fun of customers\u2019 orders. There is no respect. Furthermore, the cashier overcharged me for my drink and it ended up tasting horribly!! Do not come here. The manager should get their workers under control. My entire order was not done as I asked for it , and when received it was not mixed well and the (green powder) was all over my clothes.\nI want back To them asking them to fix it and they were not responsive, I ended up leaving and not receiving my drink.\nBad . Bad . Bad Daughter placed order to be made with soy milk. However the barista  made it with a dairy milk  with red writing half half container   When my daughter gently pointed it out bc she cannot have dairy the barista  snapped at her and said  she did not use a dairy milk but used soy and then proceeded to ignore her. tje barista  made it as we watched so unless she put soy in the container with red half and half letters then that was an incorrect statement.   It then happened to someone else so now we think they may not have any soy or oat milk and didn\u2019t bother to tell anyone. Quite unfortunate, rude, disheartening and a waste of daughter\u2019s $9. The Central Parking lot has four lots of ChargePoint chargers -- each in each corner on the 6th floor of the parking structure. Each lot has 6-12 charging stalls, so finding an open stall is not difficult. If you can't find a stall, just try your luck at the other lots in the other corners.\n\nCharging is free. You just pay for parking which starts at $9/hour but increases rapidly to a daily max of $41/day. I suppose, you could leave your car plugged in for days, but that's not very nice to others. Fun and colorful atmosphere. Conveniently located between gates A15 and A14 in the Delta terminal at Logan Airport. Food was mediocre for breakfast. Service at the bar was excellent. Atmosphere was fun and lively. Ample bar seating and many tables, high tops and regular tables.  Family friendly. Recommended, but expect to pay for the convenience. Wow...  I usually check the reviews before selecting a place to eat, but nothing else seem too appetizing to me at the airport.  The gentleman assigning tables and moving around people at the bar was outstanding.  Quick and friendly!!    The waitress who made the delicious cosmos - great.  Good pours for the wine.   Cheeseburger was just above average.  I was starving so the chicken sandwich tasted better than I would normally rate it.  French fries were yummy.  Lots of drinks, beer and TVs to watch.  Good pick and no complaints!! I ordered a ceasar salad with chicken.  The chicken was dry and crunchy.  Once I was seated and got my meal, the waitress was MIA. It was a really great experience. Our flight was delayed, and they were so kine that they kept serving full menu. especially when to give a big respect to bartender Tahicia, she was 150% on top of quality and support. Had a glass of Cold Snap before my flight back to Raleigh. Pretty cool bar with table made of hockey sticks from Canada! Not a Bruins fan but nice atmosphere anyway. Anything NHL is rather cool to me. :) I had some time before my flight, and I had missed going to the Samuel Adams Brew House in town the day before, so I thought this was my chance.  The woman working the bar was super friendly, and the service was excellent.  She helped describe the beers, and helped me choose the best one for what I was after.  So far so good.  However, I also ordered the breakfast tacos.  I don\u2019t know how you screw up a breakfast taco, but they were not good.  The bacon was pathetic.  The eggs tasted like they were made from powered, not fresh, and the cheese was not really noticeable.  The tater tots served with the tacos were excellent though.  Once I finished the tots and one of the three tacos, I gave up and told the server I was finished.  However, no one removed the plate and I had to look at the remnants of my sad tacos for the next 30 minutes while I tried to enjoy my beer.  So this is an ok place to have a beer.  I\u2019d pass on the food.

Worth a stop in if your near gate B8.\n@brewersassoc\n@homebrewassoc\n@touchdownbrewery\n#ParkerPose\n#BeerLife\n#BeerLove The chicken tender was decent, and the beer selection is solid. The coleslaw was awful. However, they were severely understaffed, with the staff rushing around to assist everyone. My order was delivered late and incorrectly. The food quality isn\u2019t bad for airport standards, If you\u2019re in a hurry, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Dbl smash cheeseburger fries and coke. Fries definitely cooked then reheated the smash burger took 2 bites disgusting. 31.00 plus tip wasn\u2019t human edible We sat at the bar for a drink and was served a round of drinks. When we finished our drinks, we did not get serviced again. The bartender kept walking past and we sat for almost 30 minutes with empty glasses. We finally had to flag him down and asked for refills."

    "reviews": "Adorable little ice skating rink to enjoy during the winter in Boston! Good crowd. There was a very talented and friendly guy giving people tips on their skating throughout the day. I would definitely go back! I'd pay the entry fee just to watch him skate, haha! They have lockers, clean bathrooms, and a snack stand. We didn't use a locker though and just left our shoes out, they were fine. Amazing place for kids to skate and learn skating as well. Unlimited fun for 25 bucks which includes the blades as well. Check the timings and weather before hand to avoid disappointment. Avoid evening to be in long queues. Mystical wonderful experience. Skates and admission were about $20 pp. Holiday music playing. Ice really well maintained with regular Zamboni runs. The nighttime ice skating at Frog Pond is truly enchanting. The combination of Christmas music, twinkling lights, and the dark sky creates a magical winter wonderland. Despite occasional lines, the quick entry and convenient location make it a worthwhile experience. What a blast! Ice skating was so much fun. A little pricey for 2 people if you don\u2019t own a pair of skates but for a weekend trip it was well worth it to go here. Cool frog\u2019s statue SO CUTE!!!!! Love frogs & love these sculptures!!! Super encantada con estas ranas me encant\u00f3 volver\u00e9 para estar m\u00e1s tiempo y divertirme Two bronze sculptures not to be missed, very funny. It gives the place a special touch. Impossible not to visit if you pass through Boston. Frogs and squirrels. The only thing missing is that the pond had real water and frogs. In any case they are very funny."
